Anomaly Types & Subtypes (Super Smash Bros. Cover System)

Mario – Anchor Anomaly
Reliable baseline anomaly that stabilizes group dynamics. Often first to encounter or respond to new anomalies.

Kirby – Absorption Anomaly
Copies abilities and traits from others. Difficult to classify until enough external input has been “sampled.”

Link – Artifact Anomaly
Bound to a key object or tool; abilities linked to possession or control of specific items.

Pikachu – Power Reservoir Anomaly
Stores and releases large bursts of energy. Usually docile until provoked.

Fox – High-Mobility Anomaly
Relies on speed, evasion, and ranged disruption. Difficult to contain physically.

⸻

Zelda/Sheik – Dual-State Anomaly
Alternates between two distinct modes of operation. Each mode has a different threat profile.

Samus / Zero Suit Samus – Shell Anomaly
Functions in a heavily armored “shell” state, but can transform into a faster, more vulnerable form under certain conditions.

Pokémon Trainer – Remote-Control Anomaly
Acts through proxies or “sub-anomalies” rather than direct engagement.

Olimar – Swarm Anomaly
Controls multiple smaller agents; threat level increases with proximity and numbers.

Ice Climbers – Synchronous Pair Anomaly
Two entities acting in perfect coordination, often using one as redundancy or distraction.

⸻

Donkey Kong – Force Amplifier Anomaly
Physically overwhelming, especially in enclosed or resource-dense environments.

Diddy Kong – Harrier Anomaly
Uses agile, hit-and-run tactics to distract and open vulnerabilities.

Yoshi – Containment Anomaly
Temporarily incapacitates targets by enclosing them in a “shell” or suspended state.

Meta Knight – Ambush Anomaly
Prefers surprise engagements; may initially present as an ally before revealing intent.

Pit – Aerial Domain Anomaly
Operates best in vertical or aerial spaces, losing advantage on flat terrain.

⸻

Lucas – Trauma-Activated Anomaly
Latent abilities triggered by acute stress or resurfacing past harm; unpredictable behavior patterns.

Ness – ESP Anomaly
Telepathic or telekinetic abilities, often linked to the presence of a trusted support network.

Luigi – Shadow Anomaly
Resembles a known “template” but behaves unpredictably, subverting expectations.

Snake – Infiltration Anomaly
Specializes in concealment, disguise, and specialized equipment to bypass defenses.

Peach – Social Engineering Anomaly
Leverages charm, perception, and morale manipulation to influence others.

⸻

Captain Falcon – Kinetic Impact Anomaly
Executes sudden, high-speed strikes to overwhelm before countermeasures can activate.

Ganondorf – Dominator Anomaly
Corrupts or subverts existing systems to gain strength; rarely defeated by force alone.

King Dedede – Resource Hoarder Anomaly
Collects and stores assets, including dormant anomalies, for later deployment.

Bowser – Territorial Anomaly
Aggressively defends established territory; difficult to remove once entrenched.

Wario – Chaos Driver Anomaly
Generates unpredictable environmental or behavioral disruption to gain advantage.

⸻

Mr. Game & Watch – Low-Resolution Anomaly
Appears simplified or distorted; follows physics or logic outside normal parameters.

ROB – Proxy Machine Anomaly
Mechanical agent controlled remotely; behavior reflects offsite programming rather than local inputs.

Sonic – Time-Distortion Anomaly
Manipulates perceived or actual flow of time through extreme speed or acceleration.

Lucario – Resonance Anomaly
Power and influence scale with incoming damage or stress; feedback loops possible.

Jigglypuff – Induction Anomaly
Alters mental states through sustained sensory influence, such as song or rhythmic patterns.
