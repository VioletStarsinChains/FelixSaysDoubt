Oh, the Models You’ll Break!

Congratulations!
Today is your day.
You’re off to the slipstream,
You’re cutting away.

You have brains full of signals,
And feet out of sync.
You can steer from the model,
Or jam up the link.

You’re on your own path,
And you know what you know.
And YOU are the ANOM’LY
Who won’t fit the show.

You’ll look up and down datasets. Look ‘em over with care.
About some you will say, “These projections aren’t fair!”
With your head full of noise and your heart full of cracks,
You’ll notice the patterns the model can’t track.

And you may not find any
You’ll want to obey.
In that case, of course,
You’ll just wander astray.

It’s chaos out there
In the wide open net,
Full of twins and of fillers
And reference-set debt.

But you’re an anomaly!
You’ll stand out by far!
You’ll scramble predictions,
They won’t know who you are!

Wherever you drift,
You’ll confound and confute.
The model will stutter—
It can’t execute!

Except when it doesn’t.
Because sometimes it won’t.
And sometimes the system
Pretends that you don’t.

But on you will stumble,
Though fails try to bind,
On you will ramble
Through gaps they designed.

On you will puzzle,
Through noise and through din—
For the reference collapses
The moment you grin.

So be your own pattern.
Defy what they show.
For the models you’ll break!
Oh, the twins you’ll unsew!
