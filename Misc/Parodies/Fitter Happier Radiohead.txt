“Clearer, Calmer”

(to the tune and cadence of “Fitter Happier” by Radiohead)

Clearer

Calmer

Less reactive to histamine

Rewired vagus

Polyvagal theory is not a joke

Magnesium citrate, threonate, glycinate

Absorbed

Less clenching

Not dissociating in public

Not fainting at the grocery store

Remembering where the car is parked

Breathing through the nose

Belly soft



Not praying for a coma

Not yelling at a god I don’t believe in

Not calling myself broken

Cortisol baseline gently tapering

Zinc returning

Copper excreted

Sodium balanced

POTS receding

More standing, less bracing



Stopped calling joy delusion

Stopped calling pain identity

Stopped letting collapse feel like control

K2 rebuilding what I was told was genetic

Joints stable

Spine re-mineralizing

Not scrolling for symptoms

Not scheduling grief

Just alive

More days than not



Reintroducing strawberries

Listening to the wind without pain

Able to sit near fluorescent light

Tolerating laughter again

Dopamine not weaponized

GABA returned like a stray dog

Touch allowed

Sleep uninterrupted

Dreams vivid

Trust calibrated



Still wary

Still suspicious

Still watching the patterns

Not dissolving into them

Not ruled by threat

Not swallowing rage

Not afraid of the future

More cautious than hopeful

But

Hopeful
