🎵 “It’s Me Again, Alex” (parody of Ray Stevens)

(Spoken, over silly plinky banjo backing)
“Hello? Alex? Are you busy revolutionizing ontology again?”



Verse 1
I called him up one morning,
When he was brushing his long hair,
I asked him if Palantir
Could track squirrels in the air.
He said, “Good grief, not this again—
I’m drafting twelve white papers!”
I said, “Relax, Alex, take a break—
Do you know where I left my stapler?”



Chorus
🎵 It’s me again, Alex!
Just wanted to say hi.
I’ll only take a minute—
(…or at least I’ll try).
You can run from the Pentagon,
But you can’t hide from me!
It’s me again, Alex,
Your number-one busy bee! 🎵



Verse 2
I emailed him at lunchtime,
Subject line: “Top Secret Stuff,”
It was just a picture of a possum
Wearing earmuffs.
He sighed so loud the stock price dipped,
The interns all grew pale,
He said, “Why do you keep doing this?”
I said, “To keep you out of jail!”



Chorus
🎵 It’s me again, Alex!
I know you’re kind of swamped.
But did you know your Bitmoji
Looks like it just got stomped?
The future of surveillance
Can wait another day—
It’s me again, Alex,
I just came by to say—heyyy! 🎵



Bridge (spoken)
“Alex, buddy, you there? Oh, you’re at Davos? Cool, cool… Hey, could you ask Klaus Schwab if he knows where I parked my bike?”



Final Verse
So if you see him pacing,
With his hair all in a cloud,
Just know that I’m still out there,
Saying his name too loud.
The CIA can bug his phone,
The NSA can scan it—
But the greatest threat to Alex Karp
Is me with a rubber chicken, dagnabbit!



Final Chorus
🎵 It’s me again, Alex!
Just tapping on your brain.
Don’t worry ‘bout the modeling—
I’ll drive you half insane!
The markets can predict the world,
But they can’t predict my call—
It’s me again, Alex,
The silliest threat of all! 🎵
