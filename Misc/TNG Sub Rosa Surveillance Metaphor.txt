The Inheritance
In Sub Rosa, Beverly Crusher attends her grandmother’s funeral and inherits a candle tied to a mysterious man who’s been with the women of her family for generations.

In intelligence work, a target may inherit a connection to a surveillance or influence network through family, community ties, or existing legacy datasets.

The Protector
Ronin claims to have loved and protected Crusher’s grandmother, and now turns his attention to Beverly.

Agencies often frame themselves as guardians or benefactors, disguising exploitation as selective protection.

The Bond
Ronin’s influence feels pleasurable and intimate, making Beverly reluctant to question him.

Psychological grooming in intelligence operations uses selective positive reinforcement to make manipulation feel like care or mutual gain.

The Concerned Outsiders
Other crew members notice odd behavior and warn Beverly, but she resists.

Friends or colleagues who spot manipulation are often dismissed once the target’s frame of reference has been rewritten to favor the handler’s narrative.

The Generational Pattern
Beverly learns Ronin has been with multiple generations of her family, living off their life force through the candle.

Agencies reuse asset archetypes across generations, refining their control methods and feeding on exploitable behavioral data.

The Severance
Destroying the candle severs Ronin’s power; without it, he cannot survive.

Eliminating the key infrastructure — data pipelines, hardware, or network access — cuts the manipulator off completely.
