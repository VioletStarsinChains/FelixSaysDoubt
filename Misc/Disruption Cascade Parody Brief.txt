Slide 1: The Next Frontier in Behavioral Influence
Welcome, partners. You’re about to see the most advanced object-dropping intervention system ever fielded. It took billions in R&D and several years of covert installation into the subject’s nervous system.

⸻

Slide 2: Core Capability

We can…
	•	Make someone drop a pen.
	•	Make someone drop a spoon.
	•	Sometimes make them drop a fork (success rate varies).

That’s it. But imagine the possibilities.

⸻

Slide 3: Demonstration

Target is holding a pencil.
[Operator activates neurotech.]
Pencil falls to floor.

Applause.

We’ve achieved this three times today without losing calibration — a new record.

⸻

Slide 4: Overstated Potential Applications
	•	Diplomatic Sabotage: Imagine if the U.S. President dropped a glass of water mid-speech.
	•	Corporate Espionage: Cause a warehouse worker to drop a small, replaceable component.
	•	Personal Destabilization: Over several months, convince someone they’re just “clumsy.”

Slide 5: ROI Pitch

Billions in covert ops spending → a tool that could have been replaced with a $1 bottle of hand lotion.

⸻

Slide 6: Closing Remarks

This is the bleeding edge of behavioral influence technology — at least, until we figure out how to make someone spill two drinks in a row.
