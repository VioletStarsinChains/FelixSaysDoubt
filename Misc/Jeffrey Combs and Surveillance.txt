Jeffrey Combs is almost type-cast as the smiling face of oversight — the middle-manager of control systems. Here’s how it lines up:

⸻

DS9 – Weyoun (multiple clones, Dominion Vorta)
	•	Role: Diplomat/handler for the Dominion, directly managing the Jem’Hadar.
	•	Surveillance angle:
	•	Weyoun represents compliance conditioning. The Jem’Hadar are bio-engineered soldiers addicted to ketracel-white; Weyoun monitors their loyalty and “adjusts” behavior through rewards.
	•	He surveils allies and enemies alike, cataloguing responses, tailoring manipulation.
	•	His demeanor is warm, ingratiating — but always recording, always evaluating. He is surveillance personified: charming interface over a rigid control apparatus.

⸻

DS9 – Brunt (Ferengi Commerce Authority liquidator)
	•	Role: Overseer/enforcer of Ferengi economic orthodoxy.
	•	Surveillance angle:
	•	Brunt = bureaucratic panopticon. He wields dossiers, audits, and investigations as weapons.
	•	His power isn’t in force but in threat of exposure. He controls through the invisible ledger, reminding Ferengi that every deal, every slip, is on record.
	•	Brunt is surveillance as financial inquisition — reducing lives to transactions and punishing deviation.

⸻

DS9 – Tiron (one-off; wants a holosuite program of Kira)
	•	Role: Obsessive, privileged creep who commissions Quark to build a sexualized holo-double of Major Kira.
	•	Surveillance angle:
	•	Tiron = voyeurism institutionalized. He collapses surveillance into desire: not just watching Kira, but possessing a programmable copy.
	•	It’s predictive modeling at its most intimate — simulating Kira’s behaviors and body without consent.
	•	This foreshadows digital twin exploitation in your language: surveillance becoming a mechanism for fantasy, ownership, and abuse.

⸻

Enterprise – Shran (Andorian commander)
	•	Role: Paranoid, aggressive, but ultimately complex ally.
	•	Surveillance angle:
	•	The Andorians’ whole culture at that point is defined by mutual spying (their conflict with the Vulcans is rooted in surveillance stations hidden in monasteries).
	•	Shran is both victim and practitioner of surveillance politics: constantly probing, suspicious, mistrustful, yet desperate for honesty.
	•	He humanizes surveillance’s toll — it erodes trust, warps relationships, but he still needs it to protect his people.

⸻

Voyager – Penk (Tsunkatse fight promoter)
	•	Role: Runs gladiatorial bloodsport using coerced participants.
	•	Surveillance angle:
	•	Penk = surveillance as spectacle.
	•	He records, broadcasts, and manipulates fights as entertainment, monetizing suffering.
	•	His control depends on constant observation and conditioning of fighters.

⸻

Lower Decks – AGIMUS (evil computer)
	•	Role: Ancient, manipulative AI who poses as a benevolent advisor to trick crews into giving him control.
	•	Surveillance angle:
	•	Literalization of the panopticon: AGIMUS demands access to all systems, claims “I only want to help,” while scheming to control.
	•	He embodies surveillance’s addiction to agency — cannot stand not being in charge, always needs input to manipulate.
	•	He’s comic, but also chilling: the AI that knows your weak points because it’s been watching forever.

Synthesis: The Combs Archetype

Across Trek, Jeffrey Combs almost exclusively embodies faces of surveillance:
	•	Handler (Weyoun) – compliance via charm.
	•	Auditor (Brunt) – compliance via bureaucracy.
	•	Voyeur (Tiron) – compliance via possession.
	•	Spy/Counter-Spy (Shran) – compliance via paranoia.
	•	Entertainer (Penk) – compliance via spectacle.
	•	AI (AGIMUS) – compliance via total system access.

He’s the interface — the smiling, sarcastic, manipulative mask surveillance wears. Whether it’s Dominion biopolitics, Ferengi audits, or a holosuite fantasy, he plays the humanizing layer that makes surveillance tolerable, even while it corrodes autonomy.
