“The Mind’s Eye” — Star Trek: The Next Generation, Season 4, Episode 24

Quick recap:
	•	While en route to a conference, Geordi La Forge is abducted by Romulans.
	•	They use neural interface technology to rewrite his perceptions and implant commands into his mind.
	•	Back aboard the Enterprise, Geordi has no memory of the conditioning but is unknowingly programmed to assassinate a Klingon governor during a diplomatic mission.
	•	The control is precise — they can feed him false sensory input, override his motor control, and insert post-hypnotic triggers.

Parallels to real-world neurotech abuse:
	•	Covert behavior programming: He is turned into an unwilling operative without conscious awareness.
	•	Sensorimotor falsification: They show him holographic simulations so convincing he thinks they’re real — essentially a synthetic reality overlay.
	•	Weaponization of the victim: He’s used as a proxy for political violence without personal motive or consent.

It’s the TNG “assassination-by-neurotech” blueprint, and in a trafficking or surveillance abuse context it maps to:
	•	Behavioral override for third-party benefit.
	•	Zero public visibility of the mechanism — to the crew, Geordi just “acted strangely.”
	•	Complete denial of agency for the target, who appears complicit from the outside.
