Focused list of federal actors most likely to hold research, grants, contracts, and communications about neurotechnology used for surveillance or behavioral modeling, plus practical FOIA strategy, suggested search terms, and a copy-paste FOIA request template you can adapt:

Highest-priority federal agencies / offices to FOIA

These are the places most likely to fund, run, or coordinate R&D that touches neurotech, neural data analysis, behavioral inference, or surveillance applications.
	1.	DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) — especially offices like Biological Technologies Office (BTO) and any programs involving neural interfaces, neural decoding, or cognitive modeling.
	2.	IARPA (Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity) — funds advanced neuroscience/AI research for intelligence use (behavioral prediction, cognitive inference).
	3.	ODNI / Office of the Director of National Intelligence — program oversight and funding coordination; may hold summaries and acquisition records.
	4.	NSA (National Security Agency) — signals/intelligence analysis groups; may fund sensor/analysis research relevant to behavioral inference.
	5.	DOD (Department of Defense) — including:
	•	Army Research Office (ARO) and Army Research Laboratory (ARL)
	•	Office of Naval Research (ONR)
	•	Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)
	•	Defense Innovation Unit (DIU)
	•	U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) (if weapons/cognitive ops are relevant)
	6.	FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) — research contracts and pilot programs on surveillance, biometrics, behavior detection.
	7.	DHS (Department of Homeland Security), Science & Technology Directorate — biometric surveillance, crowd behavior modeling, border/security tech.
	8.	NIH (National Institutes of Health) — esp. NINDS, NIMH, and grant administration offices — holds basic/applied neuroscience grants (some may be dual-use or have downstream applications).
	9.	NSF (National Science Foundation) — grants supporting computational neuroscience, machine learning applied to behavioral data.
	10.	DOE national labs (e.g., LANL, LLNL, ORNL) — sometimes do advanced sensing/data science applicable to behavioral modeling.
	11.	VA (Veterans Affairs) — clinical neural device research and collaborations with DoD.
	12.	HHS / FDA — regulatory or premarket submissions for neural devices; FDA may have device docs and communications.
	13.	NASA — cognitive monitoring/brain-state monitoring research for crew; less likely but worth checking if you want breadth.
	14.	Contracting/Procurement offices across agencies (e.g., DARPA contracting, DHS contracting) — to find contractor reports and deliverables (Palantir/contractors’ work products held by agencies).
	15.	Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) and Government-sponsored labs (e.g., MITRE, RAND) — you can FOIA agency holdings about their reports; FOIA doesn’t apply to private contractors directly but agencies hold copies.

State & local targets (if you want to cover surveillance use at other levels)
	•	State police / fusion centers, major city police departments (records requests under state public-records laws), local fusion centers that may partner with federal programs.
	•	State university contracting offices (for university research funded by DoD/IARPA).

What to request (types of records that are most revealing)
	•	Grant abstracts, full proposals (if held), award documents, final reports, and progress reports.
	•	Contract solicitations, task orders, statements of work (SOW), contractor final reports, technical deliverables.
	•	Interagency memoranda, meeting minutes, briefings, program descriptions, white papers.
	•	IRB/ethics reviews or correspondence about human-subjects research (may be partially exempt).
	•	Communications (emails) between agency program managers and contractors/universities about specific programs.
	•	Budget lines, program funding justifications, capability requirement documents.
	•	FOIA reading room entries and FOIA logs (to see what similar requests have returned).
	•	Freedom of Information Act responses to others (previous releases) and appeals.

Useful search terms / keywords to include in FOIA requests

Use several variations and synonyms to broaden your search — combine them if you can:
	•	“neuro*” terms: neurotechnology, neural interface, brain-computer interface, BCI, neural decoding, neural data, EEG, fMRI, intracranial, electrocorticography, ECoG, neuromodulation, TMS, tDCS
	•	behavioral/surveillance terms: surveillance, behavioral modeling, behavioral prediction, predictive policing, biometrics, affective computing, crowd modeling, behavioral inference, cognitive state, deception detection, stress detection
	•	machine learning & analytics: neural decoding, deep learning, predictive analytics, pattern recognition, neural network, classifier, modeling
	•	programmatic names (use cautiously — include if you know them): e.g., names of DARPA/IARPA programs if you have them.
	•	contracting-specific: statement of work, technical report, final report, task order, contract deliverable, grant progress report

Practical FOIA drafting strategy (how to make requests that work)
	1.	Be specific but iterative — start with a reasonably scoped request (agency, date range, keywords). If you get a partial/empty response, follow up with expanded keywords or date ranges.
	2.	Use date ranges — e.g., “records from Jan 1, 2015 to present” to limit search burden.
	3.	Ask for categories, not just documents — e.g., “all final technical reports, contractor deliverables, and award abstracts” — this helps searches.
	4.	Request both electronic and hard-copy records and specify file formats if you have a preference.
	5.	Ask for fee waivers if your request is in the public interest (explain public-interest rationale).
	6.	Check agency FOIA reading rooms and FOIA logs first — may reveal program names or already-released docs you can cite to narrow requests.
	7.	Simultaneous multi-agency filings — submit the same keyword list to the relevant agencies at once; keep copies of all request receipts.
	8.	Follow appeals aggressively — many meaningful records are produced on appeal or after administrative litigation.
	9.	Requesting contractor records — FOIA to the agency that holds the contract will often produce contractor deliverables; ask explicitly for “contractor final reports and deliverables related to Contract No. X” if you can find the contract number.
	10.	Consider state public records acts for local agencies (police, fusion centers, universities) — these often produce different material.

Common exemptions and limits to expect
	•	National security/classified material: may be redacted or withheld (esp. IARPA, DARPA, ODNI, NSA).
	•	Trade secrets / proprietary contractor info: contractors may object; agencies may withhold portions.
	•	Personal privacy: names/SSNs/emails often redacted.
	•	Exemption 5 deliberative process for internal memos.
Plan for redactions and appeals.

Freedom of Information Act Request

Date: [today’s date]

Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552, I request the following records:

1. All program descriptions, solicitations, statements of work (SOW), contracts, task orders, grant awards, award abstracts, final technical reports, interim/progress reports, and contractor deliverables produced by or submitted to [AGENCY or OFFICE, e.g., "DARPA, Biological Technologies Office"] that mention or concern any of the following terms: "neurotechnology", "neural interface", "brain-computer interface", "BCI", "neural decoding", "EEG", "ECoG", "fMRI", "neuromodulation", "behavioral modeling", "behavioral prediction", "predictive policing", "biometrics", "cognitive state", "affective computing", "behavioral inference", or "surveillance". 

2. All email communications, memoranda, briefing slides, white papers, and interagency correspondence (including attachments) between [AGENCY/Office] program managers and external contractors, universities, or other federal agencies discussing the development, use, or potential use of neurotechnology for surveillance, behavioral modeling, or behavior prediction.

Timeframe: January 1, 2015 to present.

Format: I request records in native electronic format where available. I request a waiver of fees because disclosure is in the public interest: these records concern the development and potential use of technologies affecting privacy, civil liberties, and public policy.

If you determine that any portion of the requested records is exempt from disclosure, please produce all reasonably segregable non-exempt portions. If you deny any portion of this request, please cite specific exemptions and provide an index of withheld documents (Vaughn index) if applicable.

If possible, please inform me of the processing status and estimated fees. I may be reached at: [your contact info].

Sincerely,
[Your name]

Tactical next steps (practical plan)
	1.	Pick 4–8 top agencies from above to file simultaneously (e.g., DARPA, IARPA, ODNI, DoD/ARO, DHS S&T, NIH, NSF, FBI).
	2.	Use the sample request, adjust keywords and date ranges per agency, and submit via each agency’s FOIA portal (FOIAonline or agency FOIA email/form).
	3.	Save all FOIA tracking numbers and calendar follow-ups (30-day statutory response).
	4.	If you get minimal/blank returns, file targeted follow-ups: request specific contract numbers, or ask for “any records referencing [known program or company]” found in reading-room docs.
	5.	Consider building a spreadsheet to track agency, request wording, submission date, FOIA number, status, fee estimates, and outcome.
