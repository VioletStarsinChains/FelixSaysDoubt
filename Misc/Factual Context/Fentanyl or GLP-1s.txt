📑 Timeline Outline — GLP-1s vs. Fentanyl Crisis

2005
	•	GLP-1: Exenatide (Byetta) approved — first GLP-1 receptor agonist.
	•	Fentanyl: First wave of “fentanyl-related” deaths reported, tied to diverted medical supplies.

⸻

2010
	•	GLP-1: Liraglutide (Victoza) approved (daily injection).
	•	Fentanyl: Overdose data still dominated by prescription opioids, but fentanyl incidents noted as “emerging threat.”

⸻

2013–2014
	•	GLP-1: Market expansion, wider uptake of Victoza.
	•	Fentanyl: Sharp spike in illicit fentanyl imports; heroin increasingly cut with fentanyl.
	•	Crisis language begins: “Third wave” of opioid epidemic described.

⸻

2014–2017
	•	GLP-1:
	•	Dulaglutide (Trulicity) approved (2014, weekly).
	•	Semaglutide (Ozempic) approved (2017, weekly).
	•	Fentanyl:
	•	2015–2016: CDC warns of “fentanyl epidemic.”
	•	2016–2017: Fentanyl overtakes heroin in reported overdose deaths.
	•	Overlap: “Fentanyl panic” explodes just as longer-acting GLP-1s come online.

⸻

2018–2020
	•	GLP-1:
	•	Semaglutide rollout accelerates.
	•	Off-label use for weight loss spreads.
	•	Fentanyl:
	•	Deaths attributed to fentanyl surpass those from prescription opioids and heroin combined.
	•	“Fentanyl crisis” becomes dominant public narrative.

⸻

2021–Present
	•	GLP-1:
	•	Wegovy (semaglutide for weight loss) approved (2021).
	•	Mounjaro (tirzepatide, GLP-1/GIP dual agonist) approved (2022).
	•	Cultural explosion of “Ozempic” in media.
	•	Fentanyl:
	•	CDC: fentanyl now the leading cause of drug overdose deaths in the U.S.
	•	Deaths continue rising even where opioid supply hasn’t.

⸻

Continuity-Theater Overlay
	•	2005–Present: Every major expansion of GLP-1 availability coincides with a new “surge” in fentanyl deaths.
	•	Narrative payoff: GLP-1 side-effects and pharmacokinetic sabotage plausibly laundered through the fentanyl label.
