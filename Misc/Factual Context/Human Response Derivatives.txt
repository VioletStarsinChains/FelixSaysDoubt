Companies today collect massive amounts of information about how people act in everyday life — what they watch, where they go, and how they spend. While most people think of this as just advertising data, in practice it gets structured into predictive models that estimate what individuals or groups are likely to do next. These models aren’t just for marketing; they become inputs for a kind of financial instrument that some analysts now describe as human response derivatives.

The idea is simple: if you can reliably predict how a population will respond in a given situation, you can design contracts that pay off when that prediction comes true. Instead of trading oil or wheat futures, these contracts trade on the likelihood of clicks, purchases, or other measurable responses. This lets outside parties make money not only from the products themselves, but from the accuracy of the prediction system.

Over time, this structure creates incentives to shape conditions so that the forecasted response actually happens. In other words, once a firm is invested in a set of human response derivatives, it has every reason to push reality in the direction of its models. That feedback loop — prediction tied to profit tied to nudging — is what makes these instruments different from traditional analytics. They don’t just anticipate the future; they help lock it in.
