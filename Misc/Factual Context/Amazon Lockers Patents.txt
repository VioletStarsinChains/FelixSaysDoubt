ðŸ§¾ Did Amazon Invent It?

Not entirelyâ€”but they optimized and aggressively protected it. Hereâ€™s how:
	â€¢	Locker-style delivery and storage systems predate Amazon, especially in logistics, warehousing, and bike-sharing.
	â€¢	However, Amazon filed patents for specific innovations: mobile integration, scalable lockers, cloud authentication, time-restricted access, and integration into smart logistics ecosystems.
	â€¢	If a smaller company held early patents, Amazon may have either licensed or acquired them quietly, but their dominant patent filings are under their own name.
