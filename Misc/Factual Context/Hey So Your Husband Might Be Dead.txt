Okay, so you know how diamonds are supposed to be forever? Turns out some of them come with a factory defect — a tiny little hole in the crystal where a carbon atom should be, and a nitrogen atom sitting next door. Scientists call that a nitrogen vacancy, but honestly it’s just a diamond with an attitude problem.

Now, these cranky diamonds are ridiculously sensitive — to light, to magnetic fields, to you rolling your eyes at your neighbor’s casserole. They remember things, they hold onto energy, and they’re basically little quantum gossip hubs.

So picture this: your husband finally kicks the bucket, but instead of haunting you with creaky floorboards, his memory gets parked in a nitrogen-vacancy diamond on your nightstand. You want him to appear in the living room? Just shine the right light through it and poof! — there’s Frank, asking if you paid the water bill.

It’s like a hologram but with way more emotional manipulation. You can’t even get mad at him, because the diamond doesn’t forget anything. Every sigh, every ‘yes dear,’ every little twitch of his eyebrow is right there waiting for you. And if the projection starts glitching? Just jiggle the lamp like you used to jiggle the cable box.

In other words, forget Ouija boards. Forget psychic mediums. The future of keeping your dead spouse around is just a bedazzled little rock that doubles as a cosmic thumb drive. Diamonds really are forever — especially if they’re running Windows 95 in your bedroom.
