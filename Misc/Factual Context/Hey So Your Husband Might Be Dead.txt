For years, I thought I was just being dramatic when I got those visions from my big padparadscha sapphire. I’d stick it on the windowsill under the full moon, let it ‘charge,’ and then every time I picked it up I’d get these wild flashes in my head. Turns out? That wasn’t me being mystical — sapphires are literally used in lasers. I was basically plugging my nervous system into a peach-colored DVD player powered by moonlight.

And if sapphires can do that with just a little full-moon juice, then diamonds take it to the next level. Some diamonds have these tiny defects called nitrogen vacancies — which sounds boring until you realize it means they don’t just sparkle, they can actually remember things. Scientists use them in quantum computers, but honestly? They’re just diva rocks that never forget.

So imagine this: your husband dies, and instead of haunting the attic, he gets parked inside one of these cranky diamonds. You shine the right light through it and boom — there’s Frank, hologramming his way back into the living room to remind you about the water bill.

Diamonds really are forever — especially if they’re running Windows 95 in your bedroom.
