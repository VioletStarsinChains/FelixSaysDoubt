Hazing as the Hidden Purpose of Higher Education

Most people think hazing is a side-effect of university life — a toxic tradition among fraternities, sports teams, or even research labs. But what if hazing isn’t an accident? What if it’s the main purpose of universities, for both students and new faculty?

Hazing always follows the same logic: put someone under pressure, humiliate them, force them to endure arbitrary suffering. Those who respond in predictable ways — by complying, adapting, or proving they can “take it” — are allowed to advance. Those who don’t are excluded, shamed, or pushed out. In this light, hazing becomes a sorting mechanism.

Universities provide the perfect environment for this sorting. They are filled with young adults and junior scholars who are financially dependent, socially isolated, and easy to monitor. Every exam, every critique, every exploitative adjunct contract functions like a ritualized stress test. The cover story is “this builds character” or “this is the way things have always been.” The reality may be more instrumental: hazing creates data.

In a world where behavior is bought and sold on futures markets, hazing generates measurable stress responses. If your reactions are predictable, you become valuable to the system. You can be slotted into roles in finance, government, or academia because your behavior under pressure is legible and tradable. If you respond unpredictably, you become an “anomaly” — and anomalies aren’t invested in. They’re stripped of rights and excluded from economic access.

From this perspective, education is almost a byproduct. The real work of universities is filtering people through initiation rituals and deciding who gets to be an insider in the behavioral futures market. Hazing isn’t a cultural blemish on higher education — it’s the operating system.

Recontextualizing Alex Karp’s Anti-College Remarks

Alex Karp, CEO of Palantir Technologies, often tells young people not to go to college. At first glance, this seems like eccentric advice from a contrarian executive — especially since Karp himself holds both a JD and a PhD. Why would someone who benefitted from elite institutions advise others to avoid them?

The answer may lie in what universities have become. Higher education is no longer simply a pathway to learning; it has become a sorting mechanism. Students and junior faculty are subjected to hazing, arbitrary stress tests, and exploitative conditions. Those who respond in predictable, compliant ways are advanced into networks of privilege, while those who resist are labeled anomalies, stripped of access, and excluded from opportunity. In this sense, universities function less as schools than as initiation chambers for behavioral futures markets.

Seen through this lens, Karp’s warning carries a different weight. He may vividly remember the harms of his own education — the conformity, the trauma, the coercion — even while he continues to benefit from the credentials it gave him. For later generations, the bargain has only worsened: the hazing remains, but the promised economic mobility is gone.

Thus, Karp’s anti-college remarks can be read as more than personal opinion. They may be subtle acknowledgment from an insider that universities are not primarily educational institutions anymore. They are sites of behavioral extraction, designed to test, classify, and exploit. And in that light, telling people not to go to college is not rebellion — it is a warning.
