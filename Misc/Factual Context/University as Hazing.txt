Hazing as the Hidden Purpose of Higher Education

Most people think hazing is a side-effect of university life — a toxic tradition among fraternities, sports teams, or even research labs. But what if hazing isn’t an accident? What if it’s the main purpose of universities, for both students and new faculty?

Hazing always follows the same logic: put someone under pressure, humiliate them, force them to endure arbitrary suffering. Those who respond in predictable ways — by complying, adapting, or proving they can “take it” — are allowed to advance. Those who don’t are excluded, shamed, or pushed out. In this light, hazing becomes a sorting mechanism.

Universities provide the perfect environment for this sorting. They are filled with young adults and junior scholars who are financially dependent, socially isolated, and easy to monitor. Every exam, every critique, every exploitative adjunct contract functions like a ritualized stress test. The cover story is “this builds character” or “this is the way things have always been.” The reality may be more instrumental: hazing creates data.

In a world where behavior is bought and sold on futures markets, hazing generates measurable stress responses. If your reactions are predictable, you become valuable to the system. You can be slotted into roles in finance, government, or academia because your behavior under pressure is legible and tradable. If you respond unpredictably, you become an “anomaly” — and anomalies aren’t invested in. They’re stripped of rights and excluded from economic access.

From this perspective, education is almost a byproduct. The real work of universities is filtering people through initiation rituals and deciding who gets to be an insider in the behavioral futures market. Hazing isn’t a cultural blemish on higher education — it’s the operating system.
