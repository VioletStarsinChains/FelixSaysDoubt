Original Airdate: November 15, 2000
Writers: Michael Taylor, Bryan Fuller, Michael Sussman

Episode Premise

While hiding from Lokirrim aliens who have outlawed holograms, the Doctor transfers his program into Seven of Nine’s cortical implant. This lets him “inhabit” and control her body — moving, speaking, and acting through her as though it’s his own.

Parallels to Neurotech Bodily Override
	1.	Direct Motor Function Control
	•	The Doctor operates Seven’s voice, facial expressions, and physical movements with precision.
	•	Seven is fully conscious but unable to stop his control — a perfect pop culture example of motor autonomy suppression.
	2.	Behavioral & Sensory Override
	•	The Doctor experiences food, drink, and touch through Seven’s body, showing full sensory integration.
	•	This is effectively complete body–mind interface sharing, with the “guest” in command.
	3.	Social & Reputational Risks
	•	The Doctor engages in flirtation, dancing, and eating sweets — behaviors Seven would never normally choose.
	•	This mirrors the reputational harm vector in real-world neurotech abuse — actions taken “in your body” without your consent.
	4.	Consent Timeline
	•	Initial takeover is for survival purposes and without Seven’s prior agreement.
	•	Even after the immediate threat passes, the Doctor lingers in control, highlighting how emergency justifications can slide into misuse.
	5.	Third-Party Observation
	•	To others, it appears Seven is simply acting strangely.
	•	In real-world analogs, outsiders may never know someone is being remotely controlled — making external intervention extremely difficult.

Reframing in a Trafficking Context

If you strip away the comedic tone, “Body and Soul” depicts:
	•	Unauthorized bodily occupation via neural interface.
	•	Full-spectrum sensorimotor control for the controller’s benefit.
	•	Potential for sexual exploitation — the Doctor flirts and touches others while in Seven’s body.
	•	Long-term damage potential — both to psychological wellbeing and personal relationships.

Under modern trafficking statutes, if that kind of remote control were sold, traded, or given as a “perk” in a real system, it would meet the criteria for technology-facilitated human trafficking.
