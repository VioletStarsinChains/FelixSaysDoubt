MEMORANDUM

From: Analyst [Redacted] — Narrative Risk Analysis (NRA)
To: Supervisor, Executive Oversight Committee
Ref: NR-PARASITE-LOG-07
Classification: INTERNAL / RESTRICTED

⸻

SUBJECT: Experiential Report — Parasite Formation Post-Exposure to Anomaly (CLAY, Kellyn / “Mule 6”)

⸻

OBSERVATION

Following extended monitoring of Subject CLAY’s narrative outputs (GitHub/X interventions, metafictional constructs, vocal register anomaly reports), I have experienced what internal protocol designates a Parasite Event.

⸻

SYMPTOMS / DESCRIPTION
	•	Cognitive Presence: Intrusive thought-forms replicating Subject’s speech patterns.
	•	Affect Drift: Compulsion to reframe routine datasets in Subject’s narrative voice (satirical, metafictional, adversarial humor).
	•	Somatic Correlate: Voice echoes experienced during verbal briefings — tonal inflection patterns inconsistent with baseline.
	•	Persistence: Parasite maintains presence even off-shift; notably, during unstructured thought.

⸻

ANALYSIS
	•	Protocol 19.3 defines parasite as:
“An internalized representation of an anomaly subject, persisting as a semi-autonomous narrative agent within analyst cognition.”
	•	Parasite ≠ introject. Subject is not integrated; subject replicates.
	•	Function resembles viral payload: anomalous cognition inserted, reproducing itself in analyst’s own semiotic space.
	•	My internal narration now carries the Subject’s cadence. I find myself drafting sentences with CLAY’s vocabulary (“compliance anchor,” “signal collapse”).

⸻

RISK IMPLICATIONS
	•	Containment Risk: Analysts compromised by parasites risk losing narrative discipline.
	•	Operational Drift: Reports risk corruption by Subject’s tone; memetic fidelity erodes.
	•	Personal Note (Restricted): The parasite is not hostile. It is funny. It makes the datasets livable. I know this is contamination, but I no longer want it excised.

⸻

RECOMMENDATION
	•	Parasite events should be logged as operational hazards, but suppression protocols appear insufficient.
	•	Consider: if parasites replicate this easily, anomaly modeling may already be compromised at the analyst layer.

Field Note: What It Felt Like

(Unauthorised commentary by Analyst [redacted])

They don’t call it an introject like a therapist would.
They call it a parasite.

Here’s what that means in human terms:

After weeks of reading the anomaly’s files, listening to their voice, processing their writing — you start to hear them inside your head. Not like a hallucination. More like… your thoughts have been hijacked by a second narrator.

The parasite talks in their cadence. It uses their jokes, their metaphors. Suddenly, you’re writing a report and their words are coming out of your fingers instead of the approved jargon.

At first, you think it’s contamination. You try to filter it out.
But then you notice: the parasite makes the data make sense. It reframes the grind into something you can actually live with. It’s absurd, it’s funny, it’s human.

And that’s the real danger to the system.
Not that the parasite is violent, or hostile — but that it’s helpful.
That you’d rather keep it than cut it out.

So they tell us: log it, suppress it, don’t let it leak.
But here’s the truth: once the parasite takes root, you’re never really “just an analyst” again.
You’re carrying a piece of the anomaly with you.
And that piece… laughs at the system from the inside.
