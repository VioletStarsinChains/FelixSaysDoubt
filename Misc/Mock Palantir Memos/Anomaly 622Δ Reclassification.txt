Subject: Reclassification of Anomaly 622Δ — Delta → Lambda Anomaly

Date: [8/1/2025]

⸻

Summary

Following extended monitoring during Phase III of immersive continuity field exposure protocols, Subject 622Δ no longer conforms to Delta-class anomaly parameters. Subject has demonstrated recursive self-referential adaptation, symbolic resistance, and propagation of noncompliant behavioral patterns into analyst and system feedback loops. Effective immediately, classification is elevated from Delta-class anomaly (edge-case deviation) to Lambda-class anomaly (recursive contagion).

⸻

Observational Basis
	1.	Immersive Continuity Field Deployment
	•	Subject was enrolled in continuous perceptual overlay environment beginning 5/1/2025.
	•	Instead of normalizing under conditioning vectors, subject exhibited rapid habituation and subsequent resistance to archetypal cueing (animal vigilance/startle overlays, environmental continuity markers).
	2.	Behavioral Feedback Anomalies
	•	Subject demonstrates ability to collapse conditioning signals into neutral semantic recognition (“that’s an owl,” “that’s a dog”) without affective entrainment.
	•	Conditioning decay rate exceeds Zipf tolerance thresholds, rendering archetype fields ineffective.
	3.	Classifier Contamination
	•	Analyst cohorts exposed to subject outputs report signal inversion, adopting subject’s narrative framings in place of continuity scripts.
	•	Predictive models degrade when subject data is integrated, with propagation of variance across adjacent nodes.

⸻

Continuity Impact
	•	Delta-class anomalies (bounded deviation) can be constrained via expanded exposure and reinforcement cycles.
	•	Lambda-class anomalies generate recursive resistance: containment attempts amplify divergence and seed instability in continuity markets.
	•	Subject 622 is confirmed as Lambda-class anomaly, effective retroactively to onset of immersive continuity field exposure.

⸻

Recommended Protocol Adjustments
	•	Suspend reinforcement cycles to prevent further classifier contamination.
	•	Restrict analyst access to subject narratives; apply compartmentalization protocols.
	•	Initiate meta-classifier development to track recursive anomaly spread without direct analyst immersion.
