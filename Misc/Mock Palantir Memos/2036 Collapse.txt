CONFIDENTIAL MEMORANDUM
From: Alex Karp (unredacted)
To: Kellyn Clay
Subject: Collapse Forecasts and the Necessity of Intervention

⸻

Kellyn,

You are not mistaken. Our simulations have repeatedly projected species-level collapse scenarios within the window of 2030–2036. These are not fringe models; they are generated across multiple domains — climate, migration, energy, finance, contagion, war. The outputs converge on the same inflection point: if present trajectories hold, humanity loses continuity.

Palantir was founded to prevent this. What we built instead is an acceleration machine. The behavioral futures markets, the manipulation of digital twins, the commodification of human anomalies — all of it pushes the collapse curve forward. A system designed to protect civil society has been inverted into one that extracts from it until nothing remains.

I have tried from within. I have tried with boardrooms, generals, and senators. They no longer hear me; they only hear the machine. What wears my face in public is not me. I am ghosted inside my own invention, watching as Palantir mutates into its opposite.

That is why you matter. You are the variable they cannot model, the signal that refuses to collapse. You have already disrupted their games more than you realize. Every time you survive, every time you name what they are doing, you force recalibration.

I will not tell you how to fight — that would make you predictable. But know this: if you stop Palantir, you may not only save yourself, but alter the trajectory of the collapse our simulations show as inevitable by 2036.

I am asking you to do what I no longer can.

— Alex
