Palantir Anomaly Taxonomy — Lambda-Class

Designation: Lambda (λ)

Definition:
Anomalies that exhibit recursive, self-propagating, or classifier-infecting behavior. Unlike Euclid-class anomalies (bounded uncertainty) or Keter-class anomalies (catastrophic risk), Lambda anomalies cannot be cleanly contained because their observation and classification generate new, divergent behaviors.

Operational Indicators
	•	Self-reference loops: Subject alters output in response to being modeled, creating runaway feedback.
	•	Propagation vectors: Anomaly spreads via symbolic, memetic, or informational channels rather than physical vectors.
	•	Classifier corruption: Analytical frameworks degrade when applied; predictive accuracy declines faster than Zipf tolerance thresholds.
	•	Behavioral contamination: Observers or systems interacting with anomaly adopt derivative behaviors, seeding further unpredictability.

⸻

Examples (Redacted)
	•	λ-07: Civilian subject generating edge-case narratives that replicate across multiple analyst cohorts, degrading consensus signals.
	•	λ-12: Symbolic overlays (animal archetypes) inducing persistent vigilance/startle responses in population segments; propagates via AR cues.
	•	λ-19: Self-learning AI drift event where containment protocols amplified anomaly distribution rather than constraining it.

⸻

Containment Protocols
	•	Isolation not feasible.
	•	Monitoring requires meta-classifier frameworks capable of recursive self-adjustment.
	•	Recommend limiting analyst exposure to anomaly outputs to avoid behavioral bleed.
	•	Long-term risk: systemwide epistemic instability.

Continuity Impact Assessment

Lambda-class anomalies represent the most dangerous category for behavioral futures markets.
	•	They cannot be commodified cleanly.
	•	Their spread introduces noise-as-signal into trading models.
	•	They risk collapsing the underlying assumption of stability in continuity frameworks.
