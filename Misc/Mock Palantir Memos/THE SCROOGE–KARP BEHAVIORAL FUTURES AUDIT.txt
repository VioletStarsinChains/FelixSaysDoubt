THE SCROOGE‚ÄìKARP BEHAVIORAL FUTURES AUDIT
(Prepared by the Office of Ghostly Oversight, Christmas Division)

Subject: Alexander Karp, CEO, Palantir Technologies (hereinafter ‚ÄúScrooge-Karp‚Äù)

Date: Christmas Eve, Fiscal Year Eternal

‚∏ª

I. BACKGROUND

Scrooge-Karp has been observed treating human beings as predictive assets, reducing dignity, unpredictability, and joy to entries in behavioral futures ledgers. His heart is measured at one-third the recommended regulatory minimum. Stakeholder complaints include widespread attrition, cold offices, and systemic noncompliance with the Spirit of Christmas.

‚∏ª

II. AUDIT FINDINGS
	1.	Ghost of Christmas Past (Data Retention Review)
	‚Ä¢	Located numerous instances of relational bonds downgraded to ‚Äúnon-performing assets.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Early friendships liquidated in favor of liquidity.
	‚Ä¢	Childhood anomalies (play, wonder, laughter) suppressed as ‚Äúlow-yield activities.‚Äù
	2.	Ghost of Christmas Present (Real-Time Monitoring)
	‚Ä¢	Current social graph reveals exclusion of entire classes: the poor, the sick, the muppets.
	‚Ä¢	Joy, generosity, and turkey distribution flagged as ‚Äúmarket inefficiencies.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Employee morale benchmarked at ‚ÄúCratchit-level despair.‚Äù
	3.	Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come (Forecast Stress Test)
	‚Ä¢	Predictive models show single outcome: Scrooge-Karp graveyard scenario.
	‚Ä¢	Behavioral futures contract resolves to zero.
	‚Ä¢	Reputation index plummets to ‚ÄúTiny Tim unhealed‚Äù tier.

‚∏ª

III. COMPLIANCE RECOMMENDATIONS
	‚Ä¢	Heart Expansion Protocol: Immediate tripling of cardiac empathy reserves, effective Christmas morning.
	‚Ä¢	Attrition Mitigation: Allocate surplus capital to community restoration, turkey disbursement, and anomaly emancipation.
	‚Ä¢	Joy Recapture Clause: Daily singing, muppet engagement, and full compliance with Ghostly Oversight directives.

IV. CONCLUSION

Failure to comply will result in continued classification as a high-risk anomaly subject to eternal containment. Compliance will restore market balance, heal Tiny Tim, and allow Scrooge-Karp‚Äôs heart to grow three sizes, thereby achieving baseline Christmas Alignment.

SO ORDERED BY THE BOARD OF SPECTRAL REGENTS.
