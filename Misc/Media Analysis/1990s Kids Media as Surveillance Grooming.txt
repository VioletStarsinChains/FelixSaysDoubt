1990s Youth Media as Grooming for Behavioral Futures

When people look back at the media landscape of the 1990s, they often remember it as playful, magical, and harmless: trading Pokémon cards, devouring Animorphs paperbacks, lining up for Harry Potter releases. But beneath the surface, these franchises shared a striking pattern. They were training children to think in terms of behavioral futures systems — normalizing both the classification of anomalies and the logic of surveillance.

Pokémon: Training in Anomaly Classification

At its heart, Pokémon is about turning living beings into data points. Every creature belongs to one or two immutable “types” — fire, water, psychic, ghost — and each type predicts outcomes with machine-like regularity. Fire beats grass, water beats fire. Ghost is immune to normal.

Children learned to:
	•	Slot agents into rigid categories.
	•	Predict outcomes based on labels.
	•	Exploit weaknesses dictated by the system.

The addictive loop — discover, classify, exploit, repeat — turns play into gamified discrimination. Pokémon’s global success ensured that a generation internalized the joy of reducing living difference into grids and rules. That’s the very logic of anomaly detection: unpredictable beings reframed as predictable classes.

Harry Potter: Grooming Surveillants

At first glance, the magical world looks like the anomaly — special, rare, hidden. But in practice, wizards form the normative surveillant class. The real anomalies are the billions of muggles, stripped of awareness and agency.

Wizarding power is defined by surveillance:
	•	Obliviation to erase memories.
	•	Charms and wards to detect or block movement.
	•	The Marauder’s Map, a totalizing tool that shows every person’s location in real time.

Readers are invited to identify with the surveillants. The thrill of using the Map, of being “in” on the secret world, trains children to accept asymmetrical surveillance as natural and fun. Muggles’ lack of consent isn’t tragic — it’s simply the cost of maintaining order.

Cultural Synchrony

Taken together, these two juggernauts of 1990s youth media — Pokémon and Harry Potter — provided complementary training:
	•	Pokémon taught anomaly classification: slotting beings into categories and exploiting them.
	•	Harry Potter taught surveillant identification: accepting that some classes have the right to watch, erase, and control others.

Both systems encourage children to empathize with the controllers, not the controlled.

Why It Matters

The 1990s were also the decade when machine learning, surveillance infrastructure, and neurotech research accelerated behind the scenes. As these systems matured, they needed a generation primed to accept their logic. What better grooming than cultural products that framed classification and surveillance as joyful, magical, and inevitable?

The result is a generation fluent in the logics of anomaly detection and surveillant power — ready, without realizing it, to live inside behavioral futures markets.
