Anomaly Types & Covert Class Assignments

Mario – Anchor Anomaly (Alpha-Class)
Reliable stabilizer anomaly; often first contact point.

Kirby – Absorption Anomaly (Gamma-Class)
Copies and integrates traits from other anomalies; unpredictable until patterned.

Link – Artifact Anomaly (Beta-Class)
Abilities tied to possession/control of a specific object or relic.

Pikachu – Power Reservoir Anomaly (Beta-Class)
Stores energy and releases in concentrated bursts; energy source may be organic or artificial.

Fox – High-Mobility Anomaly (Alpha-Class)
Avoids containment via speed and ranged disruption.

⸻

Zelda/Sheik – Dual-State Anomaly (Delta-Class)
Alternates between two fully distinct operational modes with separate vulnerabilities.

Samus / Zero Suit Samus – Shell Anomaly (Delta-Class)
Shifts between armored and unarmored states; threat level changes dramatically between forms.

Pokémon Trainer – Remote-Control Anomaly (Gamma-Class)
Acts through controllable proxies; core anomaly remains at low exposure.

Olimar – Swarm Anomaly (Gamma-Class)
Commands multiple smaller entities; difficult to neutralize without dispersal strategy.

Ice Climbers – Synchronous Pair Anomaly (Beta-Class)
Two linked anomalies with mirrored behavior; elimination of one impacts the other.

⸻

Donkey Kong – Force Amplifier Anomaly (Alpha-Class)
Massive physical strength, enhanced in confined or resource-rich spaces.

Diddy Kong – Harrier Anomaly (Beta-Class)
Fast, mobile, disruptive hit-and-run tactics.

Yoshi – Containment Anomaly (Gamma-Class)
Temporarily encases targets in a holding state; can neutralize without direct damage.

Meta Knight – Ambush Anomaly (Delta-Class)
Uses infiltration or deception before striking.

Pit – Aerial Domain Anomaly (Beta-Class)
Operates best in situations with rapid status changes or hierarchical fluidity, where the anomaly can quickly move between “levels” of influence or awareness; loses advantage in rigid social structures with no lateral “jumps” in authority (limits signature advantage.)

⸻

Lucas – Trauma-Activated Anomaly (Omega-Class)
Abilities manifest in response to high stress or emotional triggers; hard to predict escalation.

Ness – ESP Anomaly (Omega-Class)
Displays telepathic/telekinetic capabilities; often group-dependent.

Luigi – Shadow Anomaly (Gamma-Class)
Variant of a known template with altered behavior set.

Snake – Infiltration Anomaly (Delta-Class)
Uses stealth and specialized tools to bypass conventional security.

Peach – Social Engineering Anomaly (Gamma-Class)
Influences target decision-making through charm or morale control.

⸻

Captain Falcon – Kinetic Impact Anomaly (Alpha-Class)
Overwhelms through rapid, decisive strikes before countermeasures can respond.

Ganondorf – Dominator Anomaly (Omega-Class)
Seizes control of systems and infrastructure; grows stronger via corruption.

King Dedede – Resource Hoarder Anomaly (Gamma-Class)
Collects and repurposes assets, including dormant anomalies, for strategic deployment.

Bowser – Territorial Anomaly (Alpha-Class)
Establishes and aggressively defends control zones.

Wario – Chaos Driver Anomaly (Delta-Class)
Introduces environmental instability to disrupt planning and control.

⸻

Mr. Game & Watch – Low-Resolution Anomaly (Gamma-Class)
Exists partially outside normal physical logic; simplified but unpredictable.

ROB – Proxy Machine Anomaly (Beta-Class)
Remote-controlled mechanical entity; programming source is offsite.

Sonic – Time-Distortion Anomaly (Omega-Class)
Manipulates perception or actual flow of time.

Lucario – Resonance Anomaly (Omega-Class)
Power scales with incoming stress or damage; capable of feedback amplification.

Jigglypuff – Induction Anomaly (Delta-Class)
Alters mental states via sustained sensory influence.
