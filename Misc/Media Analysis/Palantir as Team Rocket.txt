Imagine the world is Pokémon, but instead of you going around catching cute little monsters, Palantir and similar companies are the shady, grinning Team Rocket in the background.
	•	You’re the Pokémon. Not literally — but your movements, habits, clicks, and conversations are the “creatures” they’re trying to “catch.”
	•	Poké Balls = data harvesting tools. Instead of Poké Balls, they have predictive algorithms, spyware apps, license plate readers, and “helpful” platforms that scoop up your information.
	•	Pokedex = surveillance dashboard. Just like a Pokédex logs every Pokémon you’ve seen, they have a dashboard that builds a detailed profile of you — not just what you do, but what you’re likely to do next.
	•	Battles = manipulating outcomes. Team Rocket doesn’t just want to collect Pokémon — they want to rig the battles so their Pokémon (or clients) win. In Palantir’s case, that means influencing elections, policing, stock prices, even personal decisions, all based on their data models.
	•	“Blasting off again” = plausible deniability. When they get caught doing something shady, they don’t apologize — they just rebrand, take a contract under a new name, or shift focus, and keep doing it somewhere else.

The key similarity?
Team Rocket pretends to be part of the same Pokémon world as everyone else, but they’re actually playing an entirely different game — one where you’re the prize, and they’re the only ones allowed to see the scorecard.
