🎥 Quick refresher
	•	Film: My Name is Khan (2010, dir. Karan Johar).
	•	Protagonist: Rizwan Khan, a Muslim man with autism spectrum disorder, living in post-9/11 America.
	•	Plot driver: Racial suspicion + neurodivergence combine to make him “unreadable” to institutions, forcing him to embark on a long journey to prove his innocence and dignity.

📊 1. Predictive analytics in the real world

Predictive systems (Palantir, DHS algorithms, “behavioral futures markets”) rely on pattern recognition:
	•	“Normal” = predictable, compliant, familiar patterns.
	•	“Suspicious” = anomalies, irregular behaviors, non-normative speech/affect.

For neurodivergent individuals — especially autistic people — their affect, tone, movement, and social choices often flag as anomalies.
	•	Add racialized identity (e.g., Muslim in post-9/11 U.S.), and the anomaly score spikes.
	•	This produces a false positive feedback loop: systems treat them as risky → surveillance increases → more anomalies detected → further escalation.

⸻

🧩 2. How the film shows this dynamic
	•	Rizwan’s autism makes his speech blunt, body language atypical, and affect flat — all of which predictive or security systems (and biased humans) misread as deceptive or dangerous.
	•	His Muslim identity triggers post-9/11 suspicion, so the algorithm (social + institutional) weights his anomaly higher.
	•	He becomes a walking false positive — not because of intent, but because his neurodivergence + racialization confound predictive models.

The film dramatizes this when:
	•	Airport staff misinterpret his stimming/fidgeting as terrorist nervousness.
	•	Community members read his blunt truth-telling as threat or disrespect.
	•	Institutions can’t distinguish “atypical but benign” from “dangerous.”

⸻

⚖️ 3. The broader critique of predictive systems
	•	My Name is Khan illustrates how predictive analytics (whether human judgment or algorithmic) are biased by training data.
	•	Training data assumes “white neurotypical baseline.”
	•	Anyone outside that = anomalous, high-risk.
	•	For neurodivergent people in racialized categories, double penalization occurs:
	•	Their race/religion = pre-loaded suspicion.
	•	Their neurodivergence = behavior flagged as “noncompliant.”
	•	The outcome: systemic attrition. Individuals are treated as permanent anomalies, never allowed to return to “normal.”

⸻

🎯 4. Why this matters
	•	The film becomes more than a melodrama; it’s a predictive analytics parable.
	•	It asks: what happens when someone lives at the precise intersection of anomaly categories?
	•	Rizwan’s journey is an attempt to override the false positives through direct narrative correction (“My name is Khan, and I am not a terrorist”).
	•	In predictive markets terms, he’s trying to repair his profile against the distorted model society has built around him.

⸻

✅ Bottom line: My Name is Khan shows how neurodivergent, racialized people are disproportionately punished by predictive analytics systems — whether human or algorithmic — because their signals don’t fit trained expectations. The film dramatizes how anomaly detection collapses into persecution, and how survival requires constantly asserting one’s own narrative against hostile models.

🎭 1. Continuity theater and the anomalous subject

Continuity theater = maintaining the illusion of a stable, predictable society by suppressing or reabsorbing anomalies.
	•	Rizwan Khan is anomaly incarnate: neurodivergent + Muslim, in a post-9/11 U.S. that treats both categories as inherently unstable.
	•	His very existence forces the system to decide whether to treat him as human or as hazard.
	•	The false positives he generates become fuel for continuity theater: he is cast as a “threat” so the system can reassure everyone else that threats are under control.

⸻

📊 2. Behavioral futures markets

Behavioral futures = making money by predicting and betting on how people will act.
	•	Rizwan’s atypical behaviors (bluntness, stimming, rigid routines) don’t fit models of “normal Muslim American” or “terrorist,” but his unpredictability has value.
	•	Every time he’s surveilled, stopped, questioned, or detained, the system learns from him.
	•	He becomes a stress test input: How would the public react if a Muslim autistic man is accused? What narratives can be harvested from his case?
	•	His suffering feeds the refinement of racialized + neurodivergence-linked predictive models.

⸻

🧩 3. Continuity theater mechanisms in the film
	•	Airport scenes: His odd body language is read as threat, a perfect stage for continuity theater: “See, anomalies are everywhere; we’re vigilant.”
	•	Community rejection: His autistic bluntness is reinterpreted as religious extremism — continuity theater ensures no one sees the nuance.
	•	The “prove himself” quest: His insistence on personally telling the president he is not a terrorist mirrors the impossible demand placed on anomalies — you must endlessly disprove what the system has already modeled.

⸻

⚖️ 4. The meta-truth
	•	The film, knowingly or not, shows how anomalies are turned into spectacle to stabilize the illusion of normalcy.
	•	Rizwan is both a data point and a performer in continuity theater:
	•	His detentions produce data for predictive models.
	•	His journey produces narrative closure for the public: “Even the anomalous can be reintegrated if they declare loyalty.”
	•	His individuality is consumed in service of data integrity and narrative cohesion.

⸻

✅ Bottom line

My Name is Khan reads as a case study in how continuity theater exploits neurodivergent, racialized bodies:
	•	To train predictive analytics (behavioral futures).
	•	To reinforce state legitimacy (“we caught the suspicious one”).
	•	To discipline anomalies into publicly proving their innocence.
