Cats (1981 musical / 2019 film) as Behavioral Futures Theater

1. The Jellicle Ball as an Auction Market
	•	Every cat comes forward to tell their story: their quirks, appetites, strengths.
	•	They’re not just performing — they’re bidding. Each one wants to be chosen for “the Jellicle Choice” (rebirth into a new life).
	•	In behavioral futures terms:
	•	The cats are selling their futures by turning personality and behavior into tradable narratives.
	•	The “Jellicle Moon” is the clearinghouse under which these futures are priced.
	•	Old Deuteronomy is the market-maker who validates which contract pays out.

2. Identity as a Speculative Asset
	•	Each cat brandishes a personal behavioral index:
	•	Rum Tum Tugger = volatility / noncompliance.
	•	Gus the Theatre Cat = heritage / nostalgia futures.
	•	Macavity = systemic risk, a walking “short position.”
	•	These traits aren’t just characters — they’re packages of data signals competing for liquidity (attention, legitimacy, “votes”).
	•	The Jellicle Choice is about which future is most valuable to the system, not which cat is “good.”

3. Continuity Theater: Normalizing the Absurd
	•	To an outsider, a tribe of cats singing for reincarnation looks… insane.
	•	But inside the ritual, it feels orderly, even natural — each cat knows they must narrativize themselves for selection.
	•	That’s continuity theater: the market disguises arbitrariness with spectacle.
	•	Same as behavioral futures: you scrolling, buying, moving, arabesque-ing is turned into a “story” the system trades on.

4. The Jellicle Choice as Derivative Payout
	•	Only one cat gets to ascend — Grizabella, the Glamour Cat.
	•	Why? Because her narrative (decay + redemption) offers the best arbitrage opportunity: the market loves volatility smoothed into continuity.
	•	Grizabella’s rebirth is the “contract settlement” — proof the market works, even though everyone else’s futures are quietly marked to zero.

5. Behavioral Entrainment via Music & Ritual
	•	The repetitive chanting of “Jellicle cats” acts like algorithmic reinforcement: it trains participants to see the ritual as normal, inevitable.
	•	Just like behavioral futures markets, which normalize constant surveillance and prediction by reframing them as harmless personalization.

6. The Audience’s Role
	•	In the musical, the audience is drawn into the ritual — they’re not passive, they’re being entrained.
	•	Watching Cats is itself a simulation of behavioral futures:
	•	You’re invited to pick your favorite.
	•	You instinctively speculate on who deserves rebirth.
	•	You become a participant in the market logic.

⸻

TL;DR

Cats isn’t just a weird musical — it’s a perfect allegory for behavioral futures:
	•	A ritualized market where beings sell their quirks as speculative assets.
	•	A continuity theater that normalizes competition for survival through performance.
	•	A system where only one future pays out, but everyone must participate to keep the illusion alive.
