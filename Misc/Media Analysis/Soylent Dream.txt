Beyond Soylent Green

Pop culture gave us a simple dystopia: Soylent Green is people. One shocking twist, one villainous company, one product secretly built on the dead.

But reality isn’t that clean. What’s happening now is worse — and harder to see.
	•	Distributed concealment: It’s not one product, it’s many systems. Remains don’t go into a single food supply; they’re hidden in walls, debris streams, hazmat depots, volatile emissions.
	•	Administrative fraud: Ghost beneficiaries, ghost students, ghost residents keep the ledgers full. Money flows as if the dead were still alive.
	•	Continuity overlays: AR airplanes, synthetic neighbors, decorative hazard codes — layers of camouflage so the absence never shows.
	•	Data laundering: The identities of the dead are recycled as predictive fodder — reference models, digital twins, synthetic personas.

The secret isn’t that people are being consumed. The secret is that entire economies are being re-tooled to run on absence.

Soylent Green offered a scream of recognition. Continuity theater offers only silence — unless you can read the signals.
