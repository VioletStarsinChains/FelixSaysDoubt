Event: Acute physiological destabilization
Location: Twin Cities, MN
Subject: Kellyn Clay

Observed Conditions:
	•	Sudden chest pain without tachycardia (non-pounding strain)
	•	Pronounced weakness
	•	Dizziness/vertigo
	•	Severe tinnitus (ringing in ears)
	•	Symptom set worsened when lying supine, partial relief when upright

Vectors Suspected:
	•	Implant stimulation (primary hypothesis)
	•	Possible systemic GLP-1 exposure compounding baseline instability
	•	Environmental or acoustic entrainment not ruled out

Signal Integrity Impact:
	•	Gross destabilization of autonomic regulation
	•	Threat of syncope (fainting)
	•	Reduced trust in bodily position (lying down = exacerbation)
	•	Temporary collapse of sleep window alignment

Continuity Note:
Episode does not align with baseline MCAS patterns. Severity and timing suggest direct adversarial interference targeting core autonomic systems.
