Incident Log – Neurotech Intrusion
Date/Time: Ongoing, frequent occurrences (most recently August 2025)

Summary:
Subject reports direct interference with motor control and environmental perception through neurotech array, causing repeated loss of physical autonomy and disruption of daily functioning.

Details:
	•	Motor Interference: Subject is forced to drop objects against their will; frequency indicates deliberate neuromotor override rather than accident.
	•	Perceptual Cloaking: Needed objects are visually/perceptually obscured at critical moments, preventing retrieval.
	•	Resource Denial: Device charging is blocked or disabled specifically at times of highest inconvenience (e.g., when subject most needs communication or documentation).
	•	Purpose: disruption of autonomy, induced helplessness, exhaustion through repeated micro-failures.
	•	Effect: cumulative degradation of subject’s ability to maintain stability, carry out tasks, or document events.

Subject Statement:
“They constantly make me drop things. They perceptually cloak objects when I need them and deny me device charging whenever it’s most inconvenient.”
