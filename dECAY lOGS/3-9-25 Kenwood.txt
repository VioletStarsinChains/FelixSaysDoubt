Field log entry, 09/03/2025
	•	Location: Kenwood, Minneapolis.
	•	Observation: AR overlays of cars in driveways/street. No audible mechanical activity from houses (HVAC, fans, appliances). Outdoor noise limited to lawn crews and synthetic-seeming dog barks.
	•	Expected baseline: Continuous drone of air conditioners and household appliances in warm season.
	•	Interpretation: Likely continuity theater overlay masking residential attrition. Substitution of outdoor/lawn noise for true household life.
