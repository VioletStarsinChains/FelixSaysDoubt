System Log – Decay Entry (Cluster: Steven Dale Thompson)

Arkansas (2014)
	•	First date: Steven stated he had just returned from Kuwait, had expected to be sent to Germany, but was instead assigned to Little Rock AFB.
	•	During this date, I experienced an episode of selective mutism and was unable to speak. Steven appeared oddly prepared for this and was not put off, which in retrospect felt consistent with handler behavior.
	•	Later that year, while living together at 27217 Highway 107, Cabot, AR, I witnessed Steven and another Air Force colleague bury a stolen bomb in the backyard.
	•	Around this period, Steven said he had been paid ~$60,000 to leave the Air Force before reaching retirement eligibility.
	•	He also remarked, unprompted, that if ordered to harm civilians, he would refuse.
	•	After leaving the Air Force, we relocated to Minnesota.

Minnesota – Air National Guard (post-2014)
	•	Steven joined the Air National Guard unit in Duluth rather than Minneapolis.
	•	On one drill trip, we stayed in an ANG-provided hotel room; during this trip, my car was broken into and thoroughly searched (used tissues scattered throughout).
	•	Steven repeatedly advised me to leave my car unlocked; later, an iPod containing intimate photos was stolen as a result.

Post-Service / Civilian Life
	•	Became a diesel mechanic for Caterpillar (CAT).
	•	Father was an electrician at 3M, with a history of alcoholism and abuse.

Later Encounters (2020–)
	•	After COVID began, Steven told me a later girlfriend had died from alcohol abuse.
	•	Shortly after this disclosure, he moved to Faribault, MN.
	•	When I was first rendered homeless, Steven offered to help only if granted power of attorney. I declined.

Continuities:
	•	Military links: Air Force → Air National Guard → civilian infrastructure.
	•	Handler signals: Prepared response to mutism, unusual remarks, insistence on car security strategy.
	•	Alcohol motif: Father’s alcoholism, later partner’s death, Faribault move.
	•	Attrition: $60k payoff, suspicious car search, loss of intimate photos, attempted legal control.

Status: Documented.
