	•	Follow-up observation: Upon waking, front right tire observed fully deflated (total flat).
	•	Possible mechanism: Event signature consistent with cavitation profile. Basis for assessment: subject’s lifelong exposure to repeated minor cavitation phenomena within body tissues.
	•	Environmental conditions: Overnight rain. Vehicle stationary.
	•	Impact: Vehicle immobilized. Replacement tire required.
