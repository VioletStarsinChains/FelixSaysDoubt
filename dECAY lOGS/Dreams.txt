Incident Log – Neurotech Intrusion
Date/Time: Ongoing, multiple occurrences (June–August 2025 and earlier)

Summary:
Subject reports neurotech-induced dream insertion despite baseline aphantasia. Dreams are unusually cohesive, vivid, and targeted toward specific individuals later identified as handlers.

Details:
	•	Subject has aphantasia (absence of voluntary visual imagination and limited spontaneous dream recall).
	•	Despite this, subject has repeatedly experienced vivid, cohesive dream sequences that stand out from their baseline.
	•	Dreams were clearly targeted: they involved specific individuals from subject’s life who, in retrospect, were identified as handlers.
	•	Similar pattern also observed with dreams involving a particular musician whose lyrics align with surveillance/entrainment themes.
	•	Primary observed effect: manipulation of subconscious state, reinforcement of surveillance presence even during sleep, erosion of safe mental space.

Subject Statement:
“I’ve had bizarrely cohesive and targeted dreams like that about multiple people in my life who were obviously handlers in retrospect.”
