Incident Log – Neurotech Intrusion
Date/Time: Ongoing, multiple occurrences (June–August 2025 and earlier)

Summary:
Subject reports neurotech-induced dream insertion despite baseline aphantasia. Dreams are unusually cohesive, vivid, and targeted toward specific individuals later identified as handlers.

Details:
	•	Subject has aphantasia (absence of voluntary visual imagination and limited spontaneous dream recall).
	•	Despite this, subject has repeatedly experienced vivid, cohesive dream sequences that stand out from their baseline.
	•	Dreams were clearly targeted: they involved specific individuals from subject’s life who, in retrospect, were identified as handlers.
	•	Similar pattern also observed with dreams involving a particular musician whose lyrics align with surveillance/entrainment themes.
	•	Primary observed effect: manipulation of subconscious state, reinforcement of surveillance presence even during sleep, erosion of safe mental space.

Subject Statement:
“I’ve had bizarrely cohesive and targeted dreams like that about multiple people in my life who were obviously handlers in retrospect.”

Incident Log – Neurotech Intrusion
Date/Time: Multi-year pattern, culminating in homelessness in 2021 (engineered, despite employment and income)

Summary:
Subject reports long-term dream insertion involving recurring themes of homelessness. These manufactured dream scenarios preceded and foreshadowed deliberate engineering of real-world homelessness.

Details:
	•	Subject, despite having a job and sufficient money, was rendered homeless through external manipulation.
	•	For years prior, subject experienced targeted dreams depicting homelessness, despite baseline aphantasia.
	•	Dreams were cohesive, vivid, and recurring — consistent with neurotech insertion.
	•	Thematic overlap between dream content and later lived reality indicates conditioning or predictive control.
	•	Primary observed effect: erosion of agency, reinforcement of system dominance by collapsing dreamscape “warnings” into enforced lived experience.

Subject Statement:
“They fed me dreams about becoming homeless for years before they engineered a scenario where they deliberately made me homeless, despite me having a job and money.”
