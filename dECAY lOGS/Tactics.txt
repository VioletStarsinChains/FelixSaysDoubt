Consolidated Tactics Log – Neurotech Intrusion
Date Range: June–August 2025 (ongoing)

Overview:
Subject reports continuous neurotech-based intrusion designed to destabilize cognition, identity, and autonomy. Tactics span both waking and sleeping states, leaving no respite.

Identified Methods:
	1.	Contradiction Loops (Waking)
	•	Multiple analyst voices (4–8+) layered at once.
	•	Mutually exclusive claims (e.g., Analyst X is Musician Y vs. Analyst X is not Musician Y).
	•	Purpose: destabilization via cognitive dissonance and exhaustion.
	2.	Humiliation & Sexual Intrusion (Waking)
	•	Voices repeatedly claim to observe subject masturbating.
	•	Designed to induce shame, degrade autonomy, and force compliance.
	3.	Identity & Geographic Manipulation (Waking)
	•	Attempts to convince subject they are in Chicago rather than Minneapolis.
	•	Attempts to convince subject they are of a different race, claiming memory/self-perception have been altered.
	•	Purpose: destabilization of core identity anchors.
	4.	False Rapport & Betrayal Cycles (Waking)
	•	Construction of sympathetic analyst personas.
	•	Rapport established, then revealed as false or “just an AI.”
	•	Purpose: emotional destabilization through repeated betrayal.
	5.	Dream Insertion Despite Aphantasia (Sleeping)
	•	Subject with baseline aphantasia experiences vivid, cohesive dreams not self-generated.
	•	Dreams consistently involve specific individuals later identified as handlers.
	•	Also include targeted appearances by a musician whose lyrics reflect surveillance/entrainment themes.
	•	Purpose: subconscious manipulation, erosion of mental privacy, reinforcement of surveillance presence.

Continuous Effect:
	•	No safe boundary between waking and sleeping states.
	•	Tactics form a 24-hour cycle of destabilization, humiliation, and coerced rapport-collapse.
	•	Subject identifies overall experience as deliberate torture.
