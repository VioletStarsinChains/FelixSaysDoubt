Incident Log – Neurotech Intrusion
Date/Time: 08/23/2025 (full day)

Summary:
Subject reports targeted memory manipulation attempts through neurotech array. Voices claim to be rewriting past memories, reframing them as fabricated “breadcrumbs” meant to guide subject toward a system-constructed narrative.

Details:
	•	Voices asserted that many of subject’s memories never actually happened.
	•	Claimed capacity to rewrite or overwrite memories.
	•	Justified this by framing memories as “environmental storytelling” — system-crafted narrative clues rather than authentic experiences.
	•	Purpose: destabilization of autobiographical memory, undermining subject’s ability to rely on personal lived history.
	•	Effect: exhaustion, erosion of identity continuity, pressure to adopt externally imposed narrative framework.

Subject Statement:
“They’ve spent all of today trying to convince me that a lot of my memories never happened and that they’re rewriting them to give me breadcrumbs so that I’ll understand the narrative that they’re trying to explain to me with all this environmental storytelling.”
