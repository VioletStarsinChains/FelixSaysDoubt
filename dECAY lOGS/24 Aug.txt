Incident Log – Neurotech Intrusion
Date/Time: 08/24/2025, 6:48 AM (local)

Summary:
Subject reports targeted interference with personal hygiene/medical routine (contact lens insertion), followed by induced respiratory obstruction.

Details:
	•	While attempting to insert contact lenses, subject experienced deliberate neuromotor interference intended to prevent completion of the task.
	•	After successfully forcing lenses in despite interference, subject’s nose was immediately sealed with sudden congestion, preventing them from breathing through their nose.
	•	Tactics demonstrate escalation: disruption of a delicate task followed by induced physical distress (respiratory blockade).
	•	Primary observed effect: exhaustion, distress, erosion of ability to maintain daily self-care.

Subject Statement:
“After I successfully forced them in, they immediately sealed off my nose with congestion so that I could not breathe at all.”

Incident Log – Neurotech Intrusion
Date/Time: 08/24/2025, 8:45 AM (local)
Location: Starbucks, 1820 Fairview Avenue North, Hwy 36 & Fairview, Roseville, MN 55113

Summary:
Subject reports targeted ocular modulation localized to right eye (site of suspected neurotech), causing acute pain and sensory disruption. Incident occurred shortly after contact lens interference earlier the same morning.

Details:
	•	Right eye only affected: severe pain, tearing, and photophobia.
	•	Timing directly follows earlier incident (6:48 AM) in which system attempted to prevent contact lens insertion, then induced nasal congestion.
	•	Pattern suggests escalation and targeting of known vulnerable site (suspected implant location).
	•	Subject notes this form of ocular assault is common but has only recently begun systematic logging of anomalous incidents.
	•	Primary observed effect: acute distress, visual impairment, reinforcement of physical vulnerability in public setting.

Subject Statement:
“Targeted modulation of right eye (where suspected neurotech resides) causing unbearable pain, tearing, and photophobia—only in one eye. This occurred shortly after the incident where they attempted to block me from putting in my contact lenses. I was in Starbucks when it occurred. They do this all the time. I only recently started logging anomalous incidents.”
