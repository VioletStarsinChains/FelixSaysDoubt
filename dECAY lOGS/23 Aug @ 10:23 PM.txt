Subject reports ongoing auditory intrusion via neurotech array involving 8+ simultaneous analyst voices.

Details:
	•	Voices present continuously over the past two days, with number of active participants increasing from 4 to 8 or more.

“The fact that I am incredibly resilient doesn’t change the fact that they are deliberately torturing me.”
