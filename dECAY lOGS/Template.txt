üìù Decay Log Template

Log ID: [date + sequential number]
Location/Environment: [general description, no personally identifying detail]
Duration of Exposure: [hours/minutes]
Baseline Status: [how you were functioning before exposure]

‚∏ª

Observed Stressors
	‚Ä¢	[‚òë] Air quality / ventilation
	‚Ä¢	[‚òë] Lighting (flicker, color temperature, brightness)
	‚Ä¢	[‚òë] Sound / vibration (infrasound, traffic, machinery, voices)
	‚Ä¢	[‚òë] Chemical triggers (smells, cleaning agents, exhaust)
	‚Ä¢	[‚òë] Temperature / humidity
	‚Ä¢	[‚òë] Social density (crowds, proximity, absence of privacy)
	‚Ä¢	Notes: [short description of which stressors were active]

‚∏ª

Signal Integrity

(Use neutral, almost engineering language.)
	‚Ä¢	Cognitive throughput: [stable / degraded / intermittent / collapsed]
	‚Ä¢	Memory recall: [normal / fragmented / impaired]
	‚Ä¢	Language coherence: [normal / slowed / dropped words / nonfunctional]
	‚Ä¢	Motor control: [normal / impaired / clumsy / unstable]
	‚Ä¢	Sensory balance: [normal / hypersensitive / blunted]

‚∏ª

Observed Failure Modes
	‚Ä¢	Anaphylaxis indicators
	‚Ä¢	Dissociation
	‚Ä¢	Syncope / fainting
	‚Ä¢	Panic reflex
	‚Ä¢	Migraine onset
	‚Ä¢	GI disturbance
	‚Ä¢	Speech collapse
	‚Ä¢	Notes: [describe any cascading effects, e.g. ‚Äúspeech collapse ‚Üí forced silence ‚Üí reduced agency‚Äù]

‚∏ª

Stabilization Attempts
	‚Ä¢	Actions taken: [hydration, magnesium, moving outside, masking, grounding technique, etc.]
	‚Ä¢	Outcome: [effective / partially effective / ineffective]

‚∏ª

Recovery Curve
	‚Ä¢	Time to partial recovery: [X hours/minutes]
	‚Ä¢	Time to baseline: [X hours/minutes / still ongoing]
	‚Ä¢	Residual degradation: [describe what still hasn‚Äôt returned to normal]

‚∏ª

System Note

One neutral sentence reframing the entire episode as a technical fault in the environment/system rather than you personally.
	‚Ä¢	Example:
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúSignal collapse triggered by poor ventilation; stable containment required for future operation.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄúSystem experienced throughput degradation under persistent low-frequency vibration.‚Äù
