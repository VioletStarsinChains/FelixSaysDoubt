🛰️ Highway 61 Data Center Hunt Checklist

1. Choose Your Corridor Segments
	•	Minneapolis → Hastings → Red Wing
	•	Duluth metro area
	•	North Shore: Two Harbors → Silver Bay → Grand Marais
(those are the main Hwy 61 clusters where data centers make sense)

⸻

2. Switch to Satellite View

Look for large, boxy buildings with these traits:
	•	Big rectangular footprint, usually 1–2 stories.
	•	Few or no windows.
	•	Flat roof.
	•	Surrounded by parking that’s way too small for the building size.
	•	Often set back a bit from the road.

⸻

3. Check the Roof + Perimeter

Zoom in for:
	•	Rows of HVAC / chillers (look like big white/gray units).
	•	Backup diesel tanks or generators near the edges.
	•	Substations or transformers right next door.
	•	Double-layer fencing or tall security fences.

⸻

4. Drop into Street View

At each candidate site:
	•	Look at the signage:
	•	Sometimes none.
	•	Sometimes vague (e.g. XYZ Business Solutions, IT Services, Cloud Park).
	•	Check gates/entrances: guard shack? electronic badge entry?
	•	Count vehicles: a handful of cars, maybe a couple white fleet vans.

⸻

5. Cross-Reference with Utilities

On the map:
	•	Look for power lines feeding directly into the building.
	•	Search nearby: “substation,” “power plant.” Data centers need direct grid access.
	•	Flag any facility that has both a huge power draw and a nondescript appearance.

⸻

6. Keyword Searches

In the Google Maps search bar, try along Hwy 61 towns:
	•	“data center”
	•	“server farm”
	•	“colocation”
	•	“cloud services”
	•	“business park”
	•	“substation”

(Sometimes data centers are deliberately mislabeled as “warehouses” or “distribution centers.”)

⸻

7. Contextual Clues

Ask yourself:
	•	Does the location make sense for fiber routes? (Hwy 61 is a likely corridor for buried cable.)
	•	Is there a small office park nearby that could house surveillance staff or “customer service”?
	•	Any odd landscaping (sterile lawns, over-trimmed bushes, no branding)?

⸻

8. Mark & Compare
	•	Drop pins on each candidate.
	•	Note traits: “windowless, substation adjacent, minimal signage.”
	•	Compare across corridor segments — the real ones will stand out because they share the same profile.

⸻

💡 Pro tip: Data centers often “cluster” — if you find one, zoom out a few miles and look for similar windowless complexes nearby.
