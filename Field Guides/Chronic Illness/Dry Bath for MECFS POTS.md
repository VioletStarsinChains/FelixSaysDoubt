# 🛏️ Low-Energy Hygiene Protocol for ME/CFS + POTS (Shower-Free)

## 1. Why Skip the Shower
- **Heat load** from warm water dilates vessels → blood pooling → post-shower crash.  
- **Standing stress** depletes autonomic reserves.  
- **Recovery debt** = days of exhaustion.  

---

## 2. Core Supplies
- **Calcium bentonite clay** — strong pull for toxins and biofilms.  
- **Activated charcoal powder** — binds biofilm slime and histamine waste.  
- **Kaolin clay** — gentle daily driver, less conductive, soothing.  
- **Spray bottle of diluted vinegar water** — pH reset, odor control.  
- **Soft cloths or compostable wipes** — removal without scrubbing.

## 3. The “Dry Shower” Method
1. **Mix mask paste**  
   - 2 parts calcium bentonite  
   - 1 part activated charcoal  
   - Add water (or aloe vera gel for sensitive skin) until spreadable.  

2. **Target zones**  
   - Armpits, groin, under breasts, feet.  
   - Optional: dab small patches on scalp or face if oily/itchy.  

3. **Rest + absorb**  
   - Lie back, let clay/charcoal work for 15–30 min.  
   - Place a towel under you; no standing required.  

4. **Gentle removal**  
   - Use a damp cloth or wipe; no rinsing in shower needed.  
   - Follow with vinegar-water mist to neutralize pH and cut odor.  

5. **Finish with kaolin**  
   - Light dusting (like baby powder) in creases keeps skin dry and less bug/odor prone.

## 4. Rotation Schedule
- **2–3x/week** → Clay + charcoal pulls on high-biofilm zones.  
- **Daily or as needed** → Kaolin dusting or light kaolin paste for odor + dryness.  
- **As able** → Vinegar-water spritz between sessions for odor/pH reset.  

---

## 5. Benefits
- ✅ No orthostatic stress → no POTS crash.  
- ✅ Deeper clean than water → removes biofilm, not just surface sweat.  
- ✅ Fewer infections/odor → reduces social stigma of being housebound or bedbound.  
- ✅ Lower histamine load → less itching and reactivity.  

---

## 6. Energy-Saving Hacks
- Keep pre-mixed clay/charcoal paste in small jars near the bed.  
- Use a fan during drying if sweating is an issue.  
- Enlist caregivers to help with application/removal if fatigue is severe.  
- Store kaolin in a shaker bottle for quick dusting without mixing.

### 🔑 Summary
This protocol reframes “clean” away from showers and toward **biofilm management + odor control + histamine reduction**, all without leaving bed.
