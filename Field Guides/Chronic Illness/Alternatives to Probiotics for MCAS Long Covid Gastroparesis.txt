Alternatives to Probiotics for MCAS-like Symptoms
	•	Magnesium glycinate or magnesium citrate
• Supports motility and calms smooth muscle.
• Can reduce constipation-related inflammation.
	•	Electrolytes (especially potassium + sodium balance)
• Helps stabilize mast cells and autonomic function.
• Many people with MCAS run low on potassium.
	•	Prebiotic fibers (carefully chosen, low-fermenting)
• Partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG) or acacia fiber are gentler than inulin/FOS.
• Feed beneficial bacteria without excessive gas.
	•	Butyrate (sodium or calcium butyrate)
• A direct short-chain fatty acid supplement.
• Can strengthen gut barrier without relying on bacterial fermentation.
	•	L-glutamine
• Fuels enterocytes (gut lining cells).
• Helps with barrier integrity and repair.
	•	Quercetin
• Natural mast cell stabilizer.
• Can reduce gut-driven inflammation.
	•	Digestive bitters or ginger
• Mildly stimulate motility and enzyme release.
• May ease post-meal bloating or sluggishness.
	•	Avoidance strategy: Focus on whole, low-additive foods and eliminate known histamine triggers (aged cheese, vinegar, processed meats, etc.).
