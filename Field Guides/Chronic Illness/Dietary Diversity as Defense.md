# 🍽️ Dietary Diversity as Defense  
*A field guide to minimizing contaminant risks through food variety*  

---

## 🌍 The Problem: Contaminants Are Uneven  
Different foods concentrate different hazards:  

- **Heavy Metals** → mercury in tuna, cadmium in leafy greens, lead in root crops  
- **Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs)** → dioxins & PCBs in fatty meats and fish  
- **Agrochemicals** → pesticide residues vary by crop & growing region  
- **Natural Toxins** → oxalates (spinach), cyanogenic compounds (cassava), tannins (acorns)  

Relying on a single “staple” or “superfood” increases exposure to *its specific risks*.

## 🧠 Why Variety Protects You  
- **Dilution effect** → Spreads contaminant exposure across categories, lowering chronic load  
- **Detox support** → Nutrient variety fuels the body’s cleansing systems  
- **Gut microbiome balance** → Diverse fibers feed diverse microbes, which neutralize toxins  

---

## 🛡️ Nutrients That Defend  
- **Sulfur compounds** (garlic, onions, brassicas) → activate detox enzymes  
- **Fiber** (beans, whole grains, varied vegetables) → binds heavy metals & POPs for excretion  
- **Antioxidants** (berries, greens, herbs) → buffer oxidative stress  
- **Minerals** (magnesium, zinc, selenium) → compete with toxic metals at binding sites

## ✅ Practical Tips  
- Rotate protein sources (fish, poultry, legumes, nuts) → avoid buildup of single-contaminant risks  
- Eat a spectrum of plant foods (colors = different phytochemicals)  
- Source from multiple regions/farms when possible → don’t lock into one soil/water signature  
- Limit “mono-food” habits (e.g., daily spinach smoothies, tuna every day)  
- Listen to tolerance → if your system is sensitive (MCAS, allergies), aim for *the widest safe range*

## 🌱 Rule of Thumb  
**The best diet is the most varied one you can safely handle.**  
Variety = resilience. It lowers contaminant risk, nourishes detox pathways, and supports long-term health.
