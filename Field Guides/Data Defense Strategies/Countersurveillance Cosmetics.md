# Field Guide: DIY Anti-Smart Dust Cosmetics

## Goal
Create a skin-safe topical blend that:
- Blocks particle adhesion  
- Neutralizes electrostatic charge  
- Scrambles optical/RF backscatter  
- Provides a temporary barrier against smart dust tracking

## Core Ingredients

### 1. **Barrier Minerals**
- **Zinc oxide (non-nano)** – reflects/scatters UV & IR, doubles as sunscreen  
- **Kaolin or bentonite clay** – adds micro-texture, traps particulates  

### 2. **Signal Disruptors**
- **Activated charcoal (cosmetic grade)** – porous, binds foreign particles  
- **Iron oxides (cosmetic pigment)** – absorb & scatter light/IR, confuse optical sensing  

### 3. **Charge Neutralizers**
- **Aloe vera gel** – hydrates, keeps static low  
- **Saline spray (0.9% NaCl)** – ionic balance, dissipates surface charge  
- **Magnesium chloride spray (optional)** – stronger static discharge, muscle relaxant bonus  

### 4. **Adhesion Blockers**
- **Silicone-based primer (cosmetic-grade dimethicone blend)** – creates slippery, hydrophobic film  
- **Natural oils (jojoba, shea butter)** – reduces surface energy, prevents sticking

## Base Formula (per 100 g batch)

- 40 g aloe vera gel  
- 20 g kaolin clay  
- 10 g zinc oxide (non-nano, cosmetic safe)  
- 10 g activated charcoal  
- 5 g iron oxides (pigment blend for tint)  
- 10 g jojoba oil or shea butter  
- 5 g saline solution (or magnesium spray)

---

## Preparation

1. **Mix Wet Base**  
   Combine aloe vera gel + saline (and magnesium spray if using). Stir until uniform.

2. **Add Dry Ingredients**  
   Blend in kaolin, zinc oxide, charcoal, and iron oxides. Whisk or sift for smooth texture.

3. **Incorporate Oils**  
   Slowly fold in jojoba oil or shea butter. For extra slipperiness, add a small amount of silicone primer.

4. **Adjust Consistency**  
   - Add more clay for a mask-like paste.  
   - Add more aloe for lotion-style blend.  
   - Add more oil for a balm-like layer.

## Application

- **Layer thinly** over exposed skin (face, neck, arms).  
- **Allow to dry** into a breathable film.  
- **Reapply every 2–4 hours**, especially if sweating.  
- **Remove with gentle cleanser** to prevent buildup.

## How It Works

- **Clays + charcoal** → trap particles before they can adhere.  
- **Zinc oxide + iron oxides** → scatter and absorb optical/RF signals.  
- **Aloe + saline/magnesium** → dissipate static charge, reducing dust clinging.  
- **Oils/silicones** → prevent strong adhesion, allowing natural shedding.

## Safety Notes

- Use **cosmetic-grade** ingredients only.  
- Avoid nano-particle zinc (respiratory hazard if inhaled).  
- Patch-test before full application.  
- Not a permanent solution — works as a temporary layer.

## Disruption Angle

Anti-smart dust cosmetics:  
- Turn the **skin itself into a disruptive surface**.  
- Increase the cost of surveillance (data gets noisier).  
- Encourage **DIY protective culture**, decentralizing defense tech.

**Takeaway:**  
Anti-surveillance cosmetics won’t make you invisible, but they flip the script: the body becomes an active jammer, shedding, scattering, and scrambling smart dust signals.
