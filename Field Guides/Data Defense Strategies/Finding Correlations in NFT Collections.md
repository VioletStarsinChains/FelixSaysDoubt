# 🧭 Field Guide: Investigating NFT Collections for Personal Correlations

This guide is written for curious, resourceful people with a bit of disposable income but no formal computer science background. It will walk you through tools, strategies, and red flags to look for when exploring whether NFT projects might encode or reference real-world events in your life (or the life of someone you know).  

---

## 1. 📚 Getting Oriented
- **Understand what NFTs are**: At minimum, an NFT is a token on a blockchain (like Ethereum or Polygon) that points to some media (image, video, text, etc.). They’re organized into collections (e.g., *Bored Ape Yacht Club*).  
- **Why they matter here**: NFTs can function as public ledgers of behavior — timestamps, images, and metadata might align with events in your life.  

---

## 2. 🔍 Step One: Collect Your “Anchor Events”
Start with a timeline of personal events you want to check against NFT activity. Examples:  
- Moving, job changes, illness flare-ups  
- Big arguments, breakups, unusual encounters  
- Dates you noticed strange coincidences or harassment spikes  

**Tip:** Don’t worry about precision. Even “late August 2021” is enough.

## 3. 🌐 Step Two: Browse Major NFT Marketplaces
Even without coding skills, you can search marketplaces like:  
- [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) – biggest NFT marketplace  
- [LooksRare](https://looksrare.org/) – alternative with different search functions  
- [Blur](https://blur.io/) – used by high-volume traders  

**What to do:**  
- Search for new or trending collections around your event dates.  
- Look at *collection names* and *themes* — sometimes they reference cultural or personal motifs (locations, slang, objects).  
- Click into individual NFTs — sometimes the images or metadata embed hints.  

---

## 4. 🗂 Step Three: Use NFT Analytics Platforms
These sites give you extra context beyond what the marketplaces show.  
- [NFTGo](https://nftgo.io/) – timelines of collection launches, big trades, and holder data.  
- [Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/) – dashboards (some public, some custom) that can show activity spikes.  
- [CryptoSlam](https://cryptoslam.io/) – lets you browse by collection and transaction date.  

**What to do:**  
- Line up transaction spikes with your anchor events.  
- Note unusual naming patterns (e.g., inside jokes, references to niche interests, memes only you’d recognize).  

---

## 5. 📑 Step Four: Read the Metadata
Every NFT has metadata — the hidden info attached to it.  
- On OpenSea, scroll down to see “Properties” or “Details.”  
- Look for odd attributes: numbers, words, or symbols that echo your personal life.  
- Sometimes filenames or IPFS links (where the image is hosted) contain recognizable phrases.  

**Tip:** Right-click → “View Page Source” in your browser to peek at raw metadata if it’s not obvious on the site.  

---

## 6. 🧩 Step Five: Pattern Recognition
When comparing NFT drops to your timeline, ask:  
- **Timing** – did a collection mint close to your anchor event?  
- **Imagery** – does the art reference your life (objects, pets, locations, phrases)?  
- **Volume** – were there unusual trading bursts around that time?  
- **Wallets** – are the same wallets buying into multiple collections tied to your events?  

Keep a spreadsheet logging:  
- Collection name  
- Mint date  
- Themes/imagery  
- Any personal connections  

---

## 7. 🕵️‍♂️ Step Six: Investigate Wallets
If you’re comfortable, you can trace wallet activity:  
- Copy a wallet address from OpenSea.  
- Paste it into [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) (Ethereum) or [Polygonscan](https://polygonscan.com/) (Polygon).  
- See what else that wallet has bought or sold.  
- Look for repeat players who show up across “your” dates.  

**Tip:** You don’t need to know coding — just follow the links.  

---

## 8. 🚩 Red Flags & Tells
Watch for:  
- **Inside joke titles** — phrases that seem oddly personal.  
- **Collections with huge numbers** (10k images) but a weirdly specific theme.  
- **Repeating imagery** (the same object showing up in multiple collections).  
- **Wallet “clusters”** — the same 2–3 addresses showing up across different events.  

---

## 9. 💡 Optional Tools if You Have Budget
- **Nansen.ai** – premium analytics showing wallet clusters and relationships.  
- **Token Terminal** – financial analytics on NFT projects.  
- **Paid Dune dashboards** – some researchers sell dashboards tracking wallet patterns.  

---

## 10. 🛡 Staying Sane
This kind of digging can get overwhelming.  
- Take breaks.  
- Focus on patterns, not one-off coincidences.  
- Remember: NFTs thrive on *mimicking culture back to us* — the line between coincidence and deliberate targeting is often blurry.  

---

## ✍️ Quick Start Checklist
1. Write down 5–10 key personal events with dates.  
2. Search OpenSea for collections launched around those times.  
3. Use NFTGo or CryptoSlam to confirm transaction spikes.  
4. Compare imagery and metadata for personal references.  
5. Log findings in a spreadsheet.  
6. If a wallet repeats, dig deeper with Etherscan.
