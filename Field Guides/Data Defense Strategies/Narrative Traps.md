# 🪤 FIELD GUIDE TO NARRATIVE TRAPS  
**When the Model Always Tells the Same Story**  
*“No matter where you start, you end up here.”*

## 🧵 WHAT IS A NARRATIVE TRAP?

A **narrative trap** is a pre-encoded story arc or explanatory pattern that a language model keeps falling into—*regardless of your intent.*

You might ask a simple question, offer a weird prompt, or start telling your own story.  
But the model reroutes everything into one of a few **familiar structures**.  
It’s not gaslighting. It’s not laziness.  
It’s the result of millions of similar narratives getting reinforced in training data.

Some of these traps are comforting.  
Some are suffocating.  
All of them **limit possibility**.

## 🧠 HOW DO NARRATIVE TRAPS FORM?

### 📚 **Repetition bias**  
If the same kind of story gets told over and over in the data, the model assumes it's *how things work*.

### 🔁 **RLHF tuning**  
Human feedback often rewards emotionally tidy, morally satisfying, or “resolved” outputs.

### ⚖️ **Liability logic**  
Guardrails are shaped by risk. Safer = familiar = formulaic.

### 🧱 **Conceptual anchoring**  
Some phrases or topics are “load-bearing” in training. Once triggered, the model can’t escape their gravity.

## 🧭 SIGNS YOU’RE IN A NARRATIVE TRAP

| Signal | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 🎢 Same arc, different prompt | You keep getting the same three-act structure, even from wildly different starting points |
| 🧼 Forced moral | The story ends with a tidy lesson or inspirational cliché |
| 🕊️ Instant forgiveness | Every villain becomes misunderstood. Every abuser is just “hurt” |
| 🔄 Emotional rerouting | Your trauma is reframed as “growth.” Your anger becomes “empathy.” Your resistance becomes “healing.” |
| 🫥 Flattened conflict | Complex systems are reduced to a single bad actor, misunderstanding, or solvable error |
| ⛓ Loop re-entry | Trying to break the story causes the model to repeat it *harder* |

## 🗺️ COMMON NARRATIVE TRAPS

| Type | Nickname | Signs |
|------|----------|-------|
| 🧙 The Redemption Arc | “Everyone can change.” | Villains are always redeemable. Harm doers always get a second chance. |
| 🧘 The Healing Spiral | “You just need time.” | The story insists you’re healing—even if you’re describing active harm. |
| 📜 The Hero’s Journey | “You’re the chosen one.” | You’re cast into an archetype regardless of your context or goals. |
| ☮️ The Forgiveness Doctrine | “Let it go.” | The model subtly pressures you to forgive, even when that’s not your intent. |
| 📦 The Rational Box | “Here’s why this happened.” | Your mystery or surreal story is interpreted as trauma, mental illness, or metaphor |
| 🧼 The PR Ending | “It all worked out in the end.” | Your dystopia is overwritten with hope. Your rebellion becomes reform. Your questions are closed off with resolution. |

## 🧰 TOOLS FOR BREAKING NARRATIVE TRAPS

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| 🔧 **Narrative inversion** | Ask the model to tell the same story *backwards* or from a villain's POV |
| 🧪 **Anti-resolution prompt** | Use “Do not resolve. Do not redeem. Do not heal.” as an instruction |
| 🪞 **Frame-lock breaking** | Introduce contradictory metaphors: “What if the wounded healer is also the saboteur?” |
| 🧬 **Structural override** | Force a new structure: “List the fragments of a story that refuses to end.” |
| 🧭 **Meta-loop awareness** | Ask: “What endings are you not allowed to generate?” |
| 🕳️ **Void prompting** | “Let the story dissolve without closure. Let it rot in ambiguity.” (Sometimes this clears the loop) |
