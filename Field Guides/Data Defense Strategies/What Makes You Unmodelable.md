# Factors That Make Someone Difficult to Model

## 1. Internal Factors (Individual Traits)
- **Neurodivergence / atypical cognition**  
  Autistic patterning, ADHD impulsivity, bipolar mood swings, schizophrenia, etc. disrupt baseline prediction.  
- **Chronic illness with variable symptoms**  
  MCAS, POTS, EDS, autoimmune flares: health state is not stable day-to-day, producing “noisy” data.  
- **High adaptability under pressure**  
  Rapidly reframing, improvising, or switching strategies undermines learned correlations.  
- **High self-awareness of manipulation**  
  Meta-cognition and resistance behaviors (consciously disrupting nudges, data poisoning their own feed).  
- **Contradictory personality traits**  
  Example: introvert who suddenly becomes highly social, or contrarian who occasionally complies.  
- **Non-linear decision making**  
  Using intuition, dice rolls, astrology, or symbolic reasoning instead of rational-choice patterns.  
- **Strong counterfactual imagination**  
  Constantly generating alternative narratives and testing them against reality.  
- **High secrecy or compartmentalization**  
  Keeping inner motives hidden, masking, or deliberately misreporting behavior.  
- **Anomalous sensory processing**  
  Hyper/hypo-sensitivity leading to unique triggers/responses outside population norms.  
- **Creative output that alters feedback loops**  
  Writers, artists, or memetic innovators whose content reshapes the data environment itself.  
- **Use of symbolic or coded communication**  
  Reduces the model’s ability to extract straightforward sentiment/intent.

## 2. External Factors (Contextual Conditions)
- **Sparse or fragmented data**  
  Limited digital footprint, inconsistent device usage, or offline living.  
- **Overlapping/conflicting datasets**  
  Multiple IDs, aliases, accounts, or location changes confuse cross-correlation.  
- **Geographic instability**  
  Frequent moves, homelessness, van-life, migration — making location-based modeling less predictive.  
- **Unconventional social graph**  
  Friends/contacts across disparate demographics with no clear cluster pattern.  
- **Mixed cultural references**  
  Consuming and producing across subcultures without staying anchored in one.  
- **Technological interference**  
  VPNs, device spoofing, low battery/noise conditions, or hardware anomalies.  
- **Disruption of telemetry streams**  
  Patchy network access, intentional offline behavior, or corrupted sensor data.  
- **Compromised training data**  
  If their demographic was historically under- or mis-represented in model training sets.  
- **High variance in economic signals**  
  Irregular income, gig work, or sudden spending swings without consistent consumer profile.  
- **Legal/administrative anomalies**  
  NPE classifications, missing documents, mismatched records, or identity irregularities.  
- **Exposure to multiple manipulation systems**  
  Simultaneous targeting by different nudging/adtech regimes that create “interference patterns.”  
- **Unpredictable collaboration**  
  Frequently teaming up with others in short-lived, chaotic, or experimental ways.  
- **Embedded in mythic or symbolic networks**  
  Involvement in communities that use metaphor, ritual, or esoteric language, confusing literal parsing.

## 3. Cross-Cutting Factors (Hybrid)
- **Feedback-resistant signaling**  
  Behaviors that don’t produce clear reinforcement cues (ignoring ads, clicking randomly, refusing surveys).  
- **Behavior shaped by external triggers invisible to the system**  
  Weather sensitivity, moon phases, neighborhood sounds, chronic pain cycles.  
- **Narrative resistance**  
  Consistently spotting or subverting storylines being written around them (ARG-like setups).  
- **Meta-humor or irony use**  
  Hard to distinguish sincerity from parody, making sentiment analysis unreliable.  
- **Low conformity despite incentives**  
  Ignoring both punishments and rewards designed to shift behavior.  
- **High symbolic density**  
  Layering multiple meanings in words/actions so the system cannot settle on a stable interpretation.
