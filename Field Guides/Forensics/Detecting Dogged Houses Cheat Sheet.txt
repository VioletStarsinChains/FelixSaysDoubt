Analyst Cheat Sheet — “Dogged House” ID (One-Pager)

Definition (operational): A single-family parcel exhibiting managed-access vacancy—access controlled by keypad/lockbox/smart lock and serviced episodically by vendors instead of lived-in daily by residents.

Use this when: Triage of high-score parcels (Doggedness ≥70) or adjudicating 40–69 “amber” cases.

What to Look For (from public vantage & lawful data only)

Access hardware (primary tells)
	•	Keypad deadbolt; realtor/contractor lockbox; branded smart lock (Schlage/Yale/August/igloohome/Supra).
	•	Auxiliary markers near hardware (colored zip-ties, chalk/tape hash marks, stickered numerals). Describe; do not decode.

Occupancy signals (supporting)
	•	Utilities: very low baseline with weekday midday spikes (cleaners/inspectors). Frequent connect/disconnects.
	•	Waste: bins sitting curbside for long periods; irregular/no lifts despite apparent “occupied” staging.
	•	Lawn/snow: vendor cadence without other resident activity.

Administrative/civic
	•	Vacant building registration; long-open permits (>120d); REO/corporate/LLC multi-parcel owner; foreclosure/tax issues.
	•	Repeated temporary No-Parking/barricades + tow clustering without corresponding work orders/completions.

Fast Disambiguation (common false positives)
	•	Active renovation: visible trades, materials, recent inspections → likely legit.
	•	Model/spec home: sales signage, office nearby.
	•	Short-term rental: high review velocity; regular cleaner schedule with consistent guest vehicles.
	•	Elder care / caretaker: treat as occupied; minimize intrusion; do not escalate absent corroboration.

Decision Rubric
	•	Doggedness ≥70 → Likely Dogged → compile evidence bundle; mark RED.
	•	40–69 → Possibly Dogged → request missing records (permits, utility aggregates), brief drive-by for hardware photo, then rescore.
	•	<40 → Archive; set 60-day recheck if admin flags (foreclosure, new permits) appear.

Evidence Bundle (non-PII, no codes)
	•	Parcel snapshot (owner class, flags).
	•	Access snapshot (annotated curb-view images; blur digits).
	•	Utilities chart (aggregated/consented).
	•	Civic ops table (temp NP/tows/work orders).
	•	Marker notes (descriptive only).
	•	Score breakdown + false-positive checks + chain-of-custody hashes.

Chain-of-Custody (every artifact)
	•	Source → Timestamp (UTC ISO 8601) → Hash (SHA-256 of raw file) → Storage URI.
