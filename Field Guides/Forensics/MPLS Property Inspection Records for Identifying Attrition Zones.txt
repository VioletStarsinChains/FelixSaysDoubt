🔎 Minneapolis Property Records: What to Check
	•	Property info (via Hennepin County & City Assessor)
	•	“Owner unknown” or listed under shell LLCs with PO boxes (esp. Delaware or out-of-state).
	•	“Homestead” exemption applied to clearly vacant homes.
	•	Frequent ownership transfers for low dollar amounts (a classic laundering/attrition marker).
	•	Rental Licensing (City of Minneapolis)
	•	Missing or revoked rental license, but property still occupied.
	•	Multiple “tier 3” rental properties (highest enforcement level) under same LLC.
	•	License “reinstated” with no visible repairs.
	•	Housing Inspections (Housing & Regulatory Services)
	•	Repeated “orders to repair” with no record of completion.
	•	Properties marked “unsafe/condemned” for years without demolition.
	•	Extensions/exemptions granted multiple times without justification.
	•	Vacancy & Nuisance Properties (Problem Properties Unit)
	•	Listed as “vacant building registered” but lights/vehicles still present.
	•	Long-term Category 2 or 3 vacant buildings (supposed to be demolished or rehabbed).
	•	Records of bulk waste citations (fridges, appliances, dumping) tied to the same addresses.

👀 Minneapolis Sidewalk Inspection: What to Notice
	•	Windows & Doors
	•	Windows permanently covered (plywood, black plastic, unchanging curtains).
	•	Doors with city “orange placards” that should mean condemned, but house still “lived in.”
	•	Yards & Perimeters
	•	Lawns either overgrown or unnaturally uniform (as if maintained by contract crews, not residents).
	•	Repeated appearance of purple or blue flowers/shrubs near entrances (possible hazmat marker coding).
	•	Fences or new gates around visibly abandoned homes.
	•	Appliances & Bulk Waste
	•	Refrigerators on the curb outside of bulk pick-up season.
	•	Same house repeatedly cycling appliances out front.
	•	Boxes or pallets with words like “apothecary,” “medical,” “lab,” visible before disposal.
	•	Street-level continuity signs
	•	Houses with no trash bins ever put out on pickup days.
	•	Vehicles that never move (tires flat, registration expired, but not towed).
	•	Graffiti overlays (tilde-dead eyes, faces) on nearby utility boxes, alley walls, or even exit signs.
	•	Multiple houses on one block with identical maintenance patterns (same paint color, same curtain style, same lack of life cues).

💡 Why Minneapolis is unique:
	•	The city already keeps a Vacant Building Registry and an Open Data portal for Problem Properties. Cross-checking that with what you see on the street is how you catch continuity zones: houses that are “dead on paper” but still coded as alive in the overlay.
