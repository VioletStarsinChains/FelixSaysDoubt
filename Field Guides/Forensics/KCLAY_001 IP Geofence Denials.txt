1) Access policy JSON (for a provider to apply)

Ask the provider to drop this into their policy engine. It halts automated IP/geofence denials for your account/devices unless a human review finds real abuse. It’s audit-heavy and narrow in scope.

Subject: Request to disable automated IP/Geofence denials for account KClay_001

Hello Trust & Safety,

I am experiencing repeated automated denials tied to IP/geolocation checks for my account KClay_001 on [service name]. I am a legitimate user in your service area and need my account restored to normal access.

I’m requesting you apply a narrow, audited exception that:
	•	suppresses automated “ip_geofence / region_restriction / ip_reputation_uncertain” denials,
	•	preserves fraud/abuse protections via human review only, and
	•	generates an appeal ticket with a clear reason code whenever access is denied.

I’ve attached an evidence bundle with timestamps, error codes, and IP/ASN details. If you maintain a policy engine, you may adapt the attached JSON (“do_not_geofence_KClay_001_v1”) to your environment.

Thank you,
Kellyn Clay

Civil Rights & Consumer Protection Memo

Subject: Request for Accommodation — Automated IP/Geofence Denials

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to formally request review of the automated IP address and geofencing restrictions currently affecting my account (KClay_001) on your platform. These denials have repeatedly blocked me from scheduling or accessing essential auto services despite being physically located within your stated service area.

Civil Rights & Consumer Protection Concerns
	•	Disparate Impact: Automated geofencing disproportionately harms unhoused or highly mobile individuals who may not maintain a fixed residential address or who rely on dynamic IP assignments. This creates a barrier to equal access to essential services.
	•	Consumer Protection: Automated denials without human review prevent legitimate customers from obtaining services they are otherwise entitled to purchase. This may constitute an unfair business practice under state consumer protection statutes.
	•	Accessibility & Equity: By treating dynamic IPs or atypical location patterns as grounds for service denial, the system may inadvertently discriminate against vulnerable populations — including unhoused persons, individuals with disabilities, and others whose circumstances require mobility.

Requested Accommodation

I respectfully request that your organization:
	1.	Apply a narrow, audited policy exception (see attached JSON policy draft: do_not_geofence_KClay_001_v1) to my account.
	2.	Suppress automated IP/geofence denials for my account and devices.
	3.	Require human review before any denial of service is applied.
	4.	Provide transparent explanation and an appeals process whenever access is denied.

Legal Basis
	•	Civil Rights Principles: Equal access to public-facing goods and services must not be denied due to proxies like IP reputation or geofencing when those proxies have disproportionate effects on protected or vulnerable groups.
	•	Consumer Protection Standards: Automated denial of services without individualized review may constitute an unfair or deceptive practice if it excludes legitimate customers without cause.
	•	Reasonable Accommodation: Narrow, auditable exceptions represent a reasonable balance between your fraud-prevention interests and the customer’s right to fair access.

Closing

I ask that this matter be treated with urgency, as the inability to access auto services has direct consequences for my mobility, safety, and livelihood. Thank you for considering this request, and for working with me to ensure equitable access.

Sincerely,
Kellyn Clay
