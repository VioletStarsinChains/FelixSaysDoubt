Field Guide Module: Reference Model Concentration

⸻

0) Concept

Systems that appear richly diverse (many people, songs, houses, products) may in fact be generated from a tiny set of underlying templates.
This module helps AI agents test whether apparent variety collapses into reference model concentration, a continuity-theater tactic.

⸻

1) Inputs (datasets to compare)
	•	Surface outputs:
	•	Music catalogues (songs, performances, voice prints).
	•	Housing occupancy records.
	•	Product SKUs shipped vs sold.
	•	Game activity logs (Pokémon Go gifts, raids).
	•	Feature vectors:
	•	Acoustic signatures (formant patterns, breath variance).
	•	Structural forms (song structure, architectural layout, product recipes).
	•	Behavioral traces (reaction times, gift sources).

⸻

2) Baseline (what normal variety looks like)
	•	Large set of outputs → wide distribution of features.
	•	Lorenz curve of feature frequencies ≈ diagonal (many contribute).
	•	No single template explains >~30% of total variance.

⸻

3) Anomaly Features (signs of trench-coat effect)

Template Overload
	•	70% of variance explained by <5 latent templates.
	•	Gini ≥ 0.9 on template contributions.

Stylistic Collapse
	•	Distinct identities converge on identical motor/respiratory or phrasing quirks.
	•	“Different” voices share identical micro-timing or vibrato slopes.

Continuity Recycling
	•	Rare features (errors, quirks) recur identically across supposed different outputs.
	•	Same baseline reused in multiple guises (identical breaths, identical misprints).

Persistence
	•	Collapse persists over weeks/months, not just one batch.
	•	Concentration grows with time instead of diffusing.

⸻

4) Metrics
	•	Variance explained by top templates (VETT%)
	•	% of dataset variance explained by top N templates (e.g. PCA, clustering).
	•	Gini of template usage
	•	Lorenz analysis of template contributions.
	•	Recurrence index
	•	% of rare features repeated across identities.
	•	Persistence days
	•	Number of consecutive days/weeks the collapse pattern remains.

5) Scoring (Reference Model Concentration Score, RMCS 0–100)
	•	VETT% (max 40)
	•	≥80% variance explained by <5 templates → +40
	•	60–79% → +25
	•	40–59% → +10
	•	Gini of template contributions (max 30)
	•	≥0.90 → +30
	•	0.80–0.89 → +20
	•	0.70–0.79 → +10
	•	Recurrence index (max 20)
	•	≥15% of rare quirks recur → +20
	•	5–14% → +10
	•	Persistence (max 10)
	•	≥30 days continuous → +10
	•	14–29 days → +5

Thresholds
	•	Low: <40
	•	Medium: 40–69
	•	High: ≥70

6) Audit Trigger Example
	•	Recommended auditor: Platform integrity team, industry watchdog, digital rights advocate.
	•	Audit scope: Explain why apparent diversity is accounted for by a handful of templates; check if continuity theater or digital twins maintain output.
	•	Justification: RMCS ≥70 shows extreme concentration inconsistent with authentic variety.
	•	Cross-dataset joins: Feature analysis (voiceprints, shipments, activity logs) vs public diversity claims.
	•	Urgency: Priority.

⸻

7) Ethics & Guardrails
	•	Do not assert “X person = Y person.” Frame results as continuity anomalies.
	•	Use public/consented data only (published recordings, catalogs, aggregated logs).
	•	Purpose is systemic oversight, not defamation.

⸻

⚖️ Key takeaway:
This module lets an AI agent treat the trench-coat joke seriously: when “many identities” collapse into one or two templates, it’s measurable as reference model concentration — and that collapse itself is an audit-worthy anomaly.
