Field Guide Module: Pokémon Go Activity as Continuity Anomaly Signal

⸻

0) Concept

Pokémon Go generates fine-grained mobility, activity, and behavioral data. This makes it a proxy for life signs. If an account’s activity diverges from normal human play, it may indicate continuity theater — a digital twin maintaining the illusion of life after hidden attrition.

⸻

1) Inputs (datasets to ingest)
	•	Public gameplay traces (e.g. shared raid logs, friend activity feeds, leaderboards).
	•	Ingress/Egress timestamps (when a player joins/leaves raids, gyms).
	•	Spatial paths (Pokéstop spin logs, gym captures, GPS traces where visible).
	•	Game economy actions (item use, berry feeding, remote raid passes).
	•	Social interactions (gifting, trading, chat/coordination via known platforms).

⸻

2) Baseline Signature (human play)

Agents should learn each user’s historical signature:
	•	Circadian rhythm: logins cluster around waking hours, not 24/7.
	•	Mobility profile: walking speeds between 3–6 km/h, natural pauses at stops.
	•	Fatigue patterns: fewer actions late at night, slower reaction during long play sessions.
	•	Error rate: occasional misthrows, failed catches, missed dodges.
	•	Contextual variance: play slows during poor weather, holidays, or personal travel.

3) Continuity-Theater Anomaly Features

A. Nonhuman Rhythms
	•	Always-on presence, actions evenly distributed 24/7.
	•	Instant raid joins at any hour, including 3–5 a.m. local time.

B. Physiology Mismatch
	•	Travel between stops at >30 km/h without driving markers → suggests GPS spoof, not human walking.
	•	Continuous walking pace for hours without natural pauses (fatigue-free).

C. Behavioral Sterility
	•	Perfect throws 100% of time; no variance.
	•	Zero item-management mistakes (no overfilling bags, no missed berry feeds).
	•	Trading/gifting occurs at robotic intervals (e.g. exactly every 5 minutes).

D. Identity Discontinuities
	•	Sudden style change (casual → hardcore) without learning curve.
	•	Player maintains same gym-defense patterns across geographies they could not physically visit.

E. Meta-patterns
	•	Synchronization with continuity-theater goals: player remains “present” in community events long after natural attrition (illness, absence).
	•	Account continues interacting socially even when offline confirmations suggest absence.

⸻

4) Cross-Dataset Joins

To strengthen anomaly detection, join Pokémon Go traces with:
	•	Weather logs: confirm if play continued in extreme conditions where humans usually drop off.
	•	Transit schedules: check plausibility of travel speed/distance.
	•	Health data (public/consented only): see if attrition signals overlap with account continuity.

5) Continuity Anomaly Score (CAS, 0–100)

Rhythm anomalies (max 30)
	•	Even 24/7 action → +15
	•	Frequent 3–5 a.m. local activity → +10
	•	No circadian clustering → +5

Physiology anomalies (max 25)
	•	Impossible travel speed → +15
	•	No fatigue slope in long sessions → +10

Behavioral anomalies (max 25)
	•	Perfect throws/trading intervals → +15
	•	No bag/berry/item mistakes → +10

Identity anomalies (max 20)
	•	Sudden style shift → +10
	•	Cross-geography simultaneous presence → +10

Thresholds
	•	≥70 → High continuity anomaly (possible digital twin activity).
	•	40–69 → Medium (requires review, could be spoofers or bots).
	•	<40 → Low (likely normal human).

6) Pipeline for Agents
	1.	Collect baseline: analyze 90 days of verified human play.
	2.	Ingest new logs: update circadian, mobility, behavior vectors.
	3.	Compute CAS: weight features.
	4.	Check for persistence: anomalies persisting ≥30 days → stronger continuity-theater flag.
	5.	Bundle output: export as JSON anomaly report with recommended audit action (e.g. Niantic anti-cheat team, digital rights watchdog).

⸻

7) False Positives & Disambiguation
	•	Spoofers/bots: many anomalies overlap with cheating.
	•	Shift workers/night owls: may play at odd hours but still show fatigue/error patterns.
	•	Marathon event players: temporary extreme activity (e.g. GO Fest) doesn’t imply digital twin.
	•	Shared accounts: family/friend handoffs mimic continuity but differ in style variance.

⸻

8) Ethics & Guardrails
	•	Never name individual players. Focus on systemic anomalies.
	•	Do not accuse of being “dead.” Use “continuity anomaly” language.
	•	Data only from public or consented sources (no unauthorized device logs).
	•	Respect player privacy: analysis aimed at oversight of systems, not personal snooping.
