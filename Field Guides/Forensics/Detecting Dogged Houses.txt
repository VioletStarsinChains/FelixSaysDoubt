Field Guide: Detecting “Dogged” Houses (Managed-Access Vacancy)

0) Concept
	•	Dogged (buildings sense): held open/overridden by a mechanism (here, access is centrally controlled).
	•	Operational definition for the agent: a parcel that exhibits signs of non-resident, multi-party access control and episodic service visits instead of normal occupancy patterns.

⸻

1) Signals to Ingest (lawful/consented sources only)

A) Property & administrative records
	•	Owner class: bank/REO, iBuyer, corporate LLCs with many parcels, government/land bank, HOA-owned.
	•	Status flags: vacant building registration (if required), open/extended permits, code enforcement cases, tax delinquency, foreclosure (lis pendens), probate with no occupancy certificate.
	•	Assessor class: non-homestead, “seasonal,” or “non-owner-occupied” on a single-family block.

B) Listing & access infrastructure
	•	MLS metadata: “self-tour,” “smart lock access,” “ShowingTime,” “lockbox on site.”
	•	Access hardware in imagery: keypad deadbolts, realtor lockboxes, contractor-style key safes, visible camera doorbells.
	•	Bonus: brand recognition (Supra/igloohome/Schlage/Yale/August) → high doggedness prior.
	•	On-prem markers: numbered stickers/tape, chalk/marker near doorframes, colored zip-ties on handles (often vendor routing codes). (Document—don’t decode or share codes.)

C) Utilities & services (aggregated/anonymized or consented telemetry)
	•	Water/electric/gas: chronic low baseline with short, regular spikes (weekday midday), or frequent on/off connects.
	•	Waste services: bin remains curbside for long periods, irregular lifts, or no lift despite apparent occupancy signals.
	•	Snow/lawn contracts: regular vendor visits without resident activity; municipal nuisance abatement bills to owner.
	•	Telecom: repeated service tech check-ins without active subscriber at the address (only where permitted/consented).

D) Mobility & city operations (public/consented data)
	•	Temporary No-Parking permits placed/replaced repeatedly on the same frontage without substantive work.
	•	Tow logs clustered on block-faces with repeat “temporary construction” controls (no true work orders).
	•	City work orders: barricade drops/collections with no corresponding project completion records.

E) Short-term use patterns
	•	Platform data (public): listing photos geotagged to the address, “self-check-in (smart lock)” language, frequent turnover without reviews (or listing frequently toggled on/off).
	•	Insurance/inspection notes (if held by public agencies): fire pre-plans listing “vacant” or “secured with lockbox.”

2) Feature Engineering (for the agent)

Create a Doggedness Score (0–100) with weighted features:

Access Layer (max 40)
	•	Visible keypad +18
	•	Realtor/contractor lockbox +12
	•	MLS “self-tour/smart lock” flag +10
	•	Branded smart lock detected from imagery +5

Occupancy Layer (max 30)
	•	Utilities: very low baseline + episodic weekday spikes +12
	•	Waste: 0–1 lifts/month, bins always curbside +6
	•	Snow/lawn vendor telemetry without resident signals +6
	•	Mail hold/USPS vacancy (where lawfully available or via owner consent) +6

Administrative Layer (max 20)
	•	Vacant registration or open permit >120 days +8
	•	Owner = REO/iBuyer/multi-parcel LLC +6
	•	Foreclosure/probate/ tax delinquent +6

Civic Ops Layer (max 10)
	•	Repeated temp no-parking & barricade drops with no substantive work orders +6
	•	Tow clustering at frontage in same windows +4

Thresholds
	•	≥70 → Likely Dogged (managed-access vacancy)
	•	40–69 → Possibly Dogged (needs human review)
	•	<40 → Unlikely Dogged

3) Detection Pipeline
	1.	Parcel seeding: pull assessor + code + permit + foreclosure to create a candidate set.
	2.	Imagery pass: curb-view photos (lawful sources or first-party dashcam) → CV model to detect keypads/lockboxes/camera doorbells and subtle marker artifacts near entry hardware.
	3.	Utilities fuse (privacy-safe): ingest aggregated or consented utility telemetry; compute baseline vs. spike profiles.
	4.	Civic overlay: merge temporary traffic control permits, work orders, and tow logs by geohash + date.
	5.	Short-term rental sweep: scrape public listings for self-check-in and toggling patterns; georesolve to parcels.
	6.	Score & cluster: assign Doggedness Score; cluster by blockface to find managed corridors.
	7.	Human review queue: kick out 5–10 photo frames per high-score parcel (no PII, no codes) for analyst confirmation.
	8.	Output layers:
	•	Red layer (≥70): likely dogged.
	•	Amber layer (40–69): investigate.
	•	Green (<40): archive.

⸻

4) False Positives & Disambiguation
	•	Active renovation (permit + clear contractor presence).
	•	New build / model homes (sales office nearby).
	•	Legit short-term rental (high review velocity, guest vehicles, cleaning crew logs).
	•	Elderly occupant w/ caretaker (odd utility patterns; handle with extreme care & privacy).
	•	Storm damage/insurance hold (board-up + inspection cadence).

Use a cool-off rule: if a permit shows substantive final inspections in the last 14 days and utilities normalize, decay the score by 30 points.

⸻

5) Evidence Bundle (for lawful oversight)

When the agent flags a parcel (≥70), compile a non-PII evidence packet:
	•	Parcel snapshot: owner class, status flags, permits, code cases.
	•	Access snapshot: annotated curb-view frame(s) showing keypad/lockbox (blur any numbers).
	•	Utilities chart (aggregated or consented): baseline + spikes.
	•	Civic ops table: temp no-parking + work orders + tows (dates, agencies).
	•	Notes on visible marker artifacts (describe, don’t decode).
	•	Confidence, scoring breakdown, and why false positives were ruled out.

Maintain chain-of-custody metadata (source, time, hash) for every artifact.

⸻

6) Ethics & Guardrails
	•	No trespass, no code harvesting, no device probing. Document only what’s visible from public vantage or from consented/official data.
	•	Do not publish door codes, serials, or schedules.
	•	Minimize PII. Focus on parcel-level, agency records, and aggregated utilities.
	•	Treat every property as occupied/unsafe unless verified otherwise.

7) Quick Pseudocode (scoring sketch)

for parcel in candidate_parcels:
    score = 0

    # Access layer
    if detect_keypad(parcel.images): score += 18
    if detect_lockbox(parcel.images): score += 12
    if mls_flags(parcel) includes "self-tour" or "smart lock": score += 10
    if brand_smartlock(parcel.images): score += 5

    # Occupancy layer
    if utilities.low_baseline_and_weekday_spikes: score += 12
    if waste.zero_or_irregular_lifts: score += 6
    if services.snow_lawn_without_resident_signals: score += 6
    if mail.usps_vacancy_flag: score += 6

    # Administrative layer
    if admin.vacant_or_open_permit_120d: score += 8
    if owner.class in ["REO","iBuyer","LLC_multi"]: score += 6
    if admin.foreclosure_or_tax_delinquent: score += 6

    # Civic ops layer
    if temp_no_parking_repeat_no_work: score += 6
    if tow_cluster_same_frontage: score += 4

    parcel.score = score
