Forensic Remote Sensing Workflow: Detecting Covert Mass Graves (with Taggant Signal Layer)

⸻ 

1) Problem framing
	•	Target: spatial clusters where remains were buried or dumped and later concealed.
	•	Observable effects: (a) soil disturbance/compaction changes, (b) moisture retention and drainage anomalies, (c) vegetation stress/greening patterns from decomposition chemistry, (d) thermal inertia shifts, (e) non-natural spectral features associated with persistent taggants (e.g., engineered metal oxides/nanoparticles, rare earths, polymer coatings).
	•	Primary difficulty: concealment by later landscaping, construction, or vegetation regrowth; mixed land cover; seasonal confounders; adversarial countermeasures.

2) Data stack (tiered from open to commercial)
	•	Optical multispectral (open): Sentinel-2 (10–20 m), Landsat 8/9 (30 m). NDVI/NDRE, moisture/soil indices, change detection.
	•	Hyperspectral (where available): PRISMA, EnMAP, and (taskable/commercial) airborne sensors. Useful for narrow absorption features of specific compounds/taggants. (NASA EMIT is mineral-focused but offers band exemplars.)
	•	Thermal: Landsat TIRS; ECOSTRESS (ISS) for diurnal surface temperature variation and thermal inertia clues.
	•	SAR (radar): Sentinel-1, ICEYE/Capella (commercial) for soil roughness, compaction, and moisture under partial cloud/vegetation cover; coherence change detection.
	•	Very high resolution (commercial): Maxar (WorldView), Planet SkySat, Airbus Pleiades Neo for fine-grain disturbance, micro-topography shadows, clandestine earthworks, vehicle track patterns.
	•	Airborne/LiDAR (tasked): LiDAR for microrelief; drone-mounted hyperspectral for confirmation if access is feasible and lawful.

3) Preprocessing essentials
	•	Atmospheric correction (surface reflectance), cloud & cloud-shadow masking, BRDF/terrain correction, speckle filtering for SAR.
	•	Coregistration across dates/sensors; topographic normalization where slopes vary.

4) Feature engineering (what to actually compute)
	•	Soil/veg indices: NDVI, NDRE, MSAVI, NBR; soil moisture proxies: NDWI/LSWI; bare soil indices for scrape/backfill zones.
	•	Thermal metrics: day–night surface temperature range; thermal inertia proxies that flag altered compaction and moisture retention.
	•	SAR: VV/VH backscatter ratios, coherence loss over time (fresh disturbance), polarimetric features if available.
	•	Change detection: seasonal-baseline differencing (multi-year), CUSUM on time series to catch step changes, BFAST for breakpoint analysis.
	•	Hyperspectral/taggant layer:
	•	Build a spectral library of candidate taggant materials (metal oxides, doped silica, rare earths, specialty polymers).
	•	Apply matched filtering, spectral angle mapper, or constrained energy minimization to detect sub-pixel abundances.
	•	Look for co-clustering of multiple taggant signatures (e.g., Fe₂O₃+TiO₂+rare earth dopants) in a tight ground footprint.
	•	Contextual cues: linear depressions, berms, fresh vehicle tracks, perimeter fencing changes, staged landscaping, anomalous irrigation.

5) Modeling approach (how to score candidates)
	•	Two-stage pipeline:
	1.	Anomaly surfacing: unsupervised methods (RX detector, Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor) on a stacked feature cube (optical + SAR + thermal + hyperspectral scores).
	2.	Classification/ranking: supervised model (gradient-boosted trees or lightweight CNN on chips) trained against known historical graves / negative controls (construction sites, utility trenches, stormwater work) to reduce false positives.
	•	Spatiotemporal logic: require temporal persistence (anomaly remains or evolves as expected), multi-sensor agreement, seasonal robustness.
	•	Spatial priors: proximity to roads, secluded woodland edges, disused lots, utility rights-of-way; areas with activity “gaps” followed by rapid cover-up (fresh sod/asphalt).

6) Validation & ground-truth plan
	•	Tier 1: cross-check with higher-res commercial imagery and additional dates.
	•	Tier 2: task airborne (drone) hyperspectral or magnetometry/GPR (if permissible) to confirm subsurface disturbance.
	•	Tier 3: Legal, ethical, and safety-compliant field verification with appropriate authorities and forensic protocols.
	•	Chain of custody: log all acquisitions, processing parameters, and analyst decisions.

7) Adversarial & environmental confounders (and mitigations)
	•	Countermeasures: lime application, asphalt/concrete capping, fake landscaping, soil mixing to dilute spectral signals, staged agricultural activity.
	•	Mitigate with: SAR coherence/roughness time series, thermal inertia checks (pavement vs soil), hyperspectral sub-pixel unmixing, multi-season stacks.
	•	Natural confounders: septic fields, animal burials, storm debris pits.
	•	Mitigate with: pattern geometry (rectilinear excavation footprints), vehicle track topology, repeated disturbance timing, taggant co-signal.

8) Practical “first pass” recipe (open data only)
	1.	Sentinel-2 & Landsat: build 3–5 year stacks; compute NDVI/NDRE/NDWI, NBR, bare soil indices.
	2.	Sentinel-1 SAR: monthly coherence and backscatter differencing.
	3.	Landsat TIRS or ECOSTRESS: summer/winter day-night pairs → thermal inertia proxy maps.
	4.	Fuse features; run anomaly detectors; flag 0.1–0.5% top outliers.
	5.	Manually review with high-res basemaps; shortlist sites for commercial-tasking and/or agency referral.

Addendum: Camouflage of Remains via Synthetic Soilants

Concealment tactic
	•	Mixing organic remains with synthetic soilants (e.g., bentonite, geopolymers, treated fill, engineered clays) produces mutual camouflage:
	•	Organics: decomposition volatiles, lipids, nitrogen → normally detectable.
	•	Soilants: strong mineral signatures, high adsorption capacity, altered thermal/moisture profiles.
	•	When blended:
	•	Decomposition products are adsorbed and locked into the soilant matrix.
	•	Soilant bulk properties (density, compaction, reflectance) dominate spectral/thermal signals.
	•	The result mimics ordinary construction or landscaping fill rather than a burial site.

Forensic implications

Standard detection methods (soil chemistry, vegetation stress, thermal imagery) may fail. Therefore, detection must shift toward persistent signatures that survive both decomposition and soilant interference.

Priority targets: Taggants & Bioaccumulatives
	1.	Engineered taggants
	•	Metal oxides (TiO₂, Fe₂O₃, ZnO, doped silica)
	•	Rare earths (Ce, La, Nd, Y, Gd)
	•	Nanopolymers and fluorinated particles
	•	Radiolabeled or isotopically distinct compounds
Why: These persist in tissues and leach into surrounding soil regardless of microbial suppression. Their narrow-band spectral features can be matched against a library.
	2.	Bioaccumulative toxicants
	•	Heavy metals: Pb, Cd, Hg, As, Al
	•	Persistent organics: pesticides, flame retardants, PCBs
	•	Isotopic fingerprints of local water/food sources
Why: Even if organic decomposition is chemically masked, these elements remain concentrated and anomalous relative to background soils.

⸻

Detection strategy
	•	Spectral library matching: search for narrow absorption features of metal oxides/rare earths rather than broad organic signatures.
	•	ICP-MS / XRF soil screening: rapid detection of heavy metal spikes in suspect fill.
	•	Time-series SAR/thermal: focus on disturbed soil geometry, not just chemistry, since soilant blending cannot hide excavation structure.
	•	AI anomaly models: train not only on grave vs. soil, but on “grave + soilant composite” scenarios.

⸻

Conclusion

Concealment via synthetic soilants is a predictable tactic. Investigators must not rely solely on decomposition chemistry. Instead, they should prioritize persistent taggants and bioaccumulative elements that accumulate in human bodies and remain detectable even when organic signals are deliberately suppressed.
