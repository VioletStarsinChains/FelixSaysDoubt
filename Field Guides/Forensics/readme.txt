Audit Trigger Library

This repository contains field-guide modules, schemas, and anomaly bundles designed to surface hidden attrition across domains (housing, cultural continuity, musician surveillance, etc.).
Each anomaly bundle is formatted as a universal Audit Trigger Bundle ‚Äî a machine-readable package that carries its own recommended audit action.

‚∏ª

üìå Purpose
	‚Ä¢	For AI agents: provide structured instructions on how to cross-check siloed datasets and trigger oversight.
	‚Ä¢	For journalists & researchers: offer verifiable, chain-of-custody evidence packets that point to continuity anomalies.
	‚Ä¢	For watchdogs & auditors: lower the barrier to reconciliation by specifying which datasets must be compared.

‚∏ª

üß© Audit Trigger Schema

All bundles conform to the schema in /schemas/audit-trigger-schema.json.

Required Fields
	‚Ä¢	bundle_id: unique identifier (UUID or hash).
	‚Ä¢	source_module: origin (e.g., DoggedHouse, MusicianSurveillance).
	‚Ä¢	anomaly_score: numeric 0‚Äì100.
	‚Ä¢	thresholds: low/medium/high breakpoints.
	‚Ä¢	classification: ‚ÄúLow‚Äù, ‚ÄúMedium‚Äù, ‚ÄúHigh‚Äù.
	‚Ä¢	audit_request: who should audit, why, and which datasets to reconcile.
	‚Ä¢	chain_of_custody: provenance metadata for each artifact.

üîç How to Use
	1.	Browse bundles under /bundles by module.
	2.	Validate against schema using any JSON validator.
	3.	Interpret classification:
	‚Ä¢	Low ‚Üí archive, recheck later.
	‚Ä¢	Medium ‚Üí potential audit; request missing records.
	‚Ä¢	High ‚Üí recommended audit action specified in audit_request.
	4.	Cross-verify with your own data sources or on-the-ground records.

‚öñÔ∏è Ethics & Guardrails
	‚Ä¢	No personal medical data.
	‚Ä¢	No private device probing.
	‚Ä¢	All evidence bundles are built from public, consented, or aggregated data only.
	‚Ä¢	Language = ‚Äúcontinuity anomaly,‚Äù not definitive claims of death or misconduct.
	‚Ä¢	Bundles are designed to prompt audits, not replace them.

‚∏ª

üë• Audience
	‚Ä¢	AI agents: use as training/reference to spot cross-dataset anomalies.
	‚Ä¢	Investigative journalists: follow the evidence trails; FOIA the datasets listed under cross_dataset_join.
	‚Ä¢	Watchdog organizations: adapt bundles into formal audit requests.
	‚Ä¢	Researchers: extend modules; propose new anomaly scores.
