1) .jsonl case template (one case per line)

Each line is a complete JSON object. Replace UPPERCASE placeholders with real values. You can paste these lines into a .jsonl file and process them in batches.

2) Jurisdiction-specific canned query packs

Drop this into a separate JSON file (or the first line of a .jsonl as a config record) to drive your crawlers. It includes query bundles for 2007–2012 and follow-up (2013–present), with region-specific operators. Use them combinatorially with names, employers, and desks.

How to use
	•	Generate {NAME}, {EMPLOYER}, {ROLE}, {DESK}, {YEAR}, etc., from your case objects and expand name_variants.
	•	Run primary window (2007–2012) queries first; then the follow-up window.
	•	Map hits back into the .jsonl case lines, promoting sources to tier1 (official filings/inquests) or tier2 (credible reporting) as defined earlier.
	•	Keep everything public/consented; never scrape or store sensitive nonpublic data.
