Field Guide: Respiratory/Cardiovascular Continuity Anomaly Detection (Musicians)

0) Purpose

Identify cross-silo patterns that suggest a public performance is not physiologically consistent with the artist’s historical respiratory/cardiovascular (RC) signature. Output anomaly flags, not conclusions of death.

⸻

1) Inputs (lawful, public/consented data only)

Audio
	•	Public “live” recordings (broadcasts, venue soundboard leaks, audience phones).
	•	Studio stems/isolations officially released (for baseline only).

Video
	•	Multi-angle audience videos and official footage; 30–60 FPS preferred for motion analysis.

Context
	•	Setlists, show duration, venue altitude/temp/humidity, tour routing (rest days).
	•	Mic type/placement (visible headset/boom vs handheld).

Historical Baseline
	•	Earlier verified-live performances from the same artist (establish your RC signature).

⸻

2) Respiratory/Cardio Markers (what to measure)

Vocalists
	•	Inhalation events: timing, duration, loudness; phrase-length distribution.
	•	Recovery curve: time to stable pitch/timbre after long phrases.
	•	Vibrato support: rate stability vs fatigue late in set.
	•	Noise floor around sibilants/plosives: breath turbulence should be variably present.

Wind/Brass
	•	Breath–tone coupling: audible intake preceding phrases; end-of-phrase decay profile.
	•	Embouchure fatigue: pitch center drift, increased micro-jitter across the set.
	•	Key/pad clicks vs tone energy: natural mechanical noises correlate with breath effort.

Percussion/Strings (cardio proxies)
	•	Tempo micro-variability under exertion: subtle HR-like oscillations during heavy patterns.
	•	Post-song recovery: time to baseline timing steadiness after maximal pieces.

3) Continuity-Theater Anomaly Features (red flags)

A. Breathless Consistency
	•	Long, athletic phrases with no detectable inhalations over multiple nights.
	•	Identical inhalation waveforms recurring across different venues/dates (sample reuse).

B. Desynchronized Physiology
	•	Mouth/chest/neck motion inconsistent with audio (sings “while inhaling”).
	•	Unchanged vocal level/timbre with head fully averted from mic in ambient captures.

C. Non-fatiguing Performance
	•	No embouchure or breath-support fatigue over >90 min sets historically known to induce it.
	•	Recovery curves flat across entire tour despite tight routing/altitude.

D. Over-sanitized Acoustics
	•	Perfect de-essing and gate behavior on “live raw” feeds (no breath pops, no plosives).
	•	Absent mechanical noises (key clicks, string squeaks) that previously co-occurred with effort.

E. Meta-Pattern
	•	Shift to only contexts with baked-in backing tracks or heavy broadcast sweetening.
	•	Avoidance of unsweetened radio rooms/press acoustic sets that once were routine.

4) Cross-Silo Fusion (how agents bridge “separated by design” datasets)
	•	Audio–Video Sync Check: compute breath/impact events from audio; cross-correlate with thoraco-abdominal motion vectors from video. Persistent mismatch → anomaly weight.
	•	Tour Physiology Model: combine venue altitude/temperature + set difficulty to predict expected breath cost; compare to observed (should show elevated intake/recovery at altitude).
	•	Temporal Fingerprinting: hash breath-event envelopes; Hamming distance across shows. Near-identical hashes on different dates → likely canned track segment.
	•	Context Join (privacy-safe): align public schedule with broadcast tech specs (latency logs when available) to explain—but not excuse—sanitization.

5) Scoring: RCAS (Respiratory Continuity Anomaly Score, 0–100)

Breath Anomalies (max 35)
	•	No detectable inhalations in high-demand sections (multi-song) +15
	•	Reused inhalation fingerprints across nights +12
	•	Breath-noise floor unnaturally gated in “raw” feeds +8

Sync/Physiology (max 25)
	•	Video motion–audio desync on respiration +12
	•	Recovery curves inconsistent with venue load/altitude +7
	•	Non-fatiguing vibrato/embouchure over long sets +6

Acoustic/Mechanical (max 20)
	•	Missing natural mechanical noise (keys/pops/squeaks) historically present +10
	•	Mic position implausible for observed level/timbre +10

Meta-Context (max 20)
	•	Exclusive reliance on sweetened/broadcast contexts post-baseline +10
	•	Absence of candid/unsweetened appearances over ≥12 months +10

Thresholds
	•	≥70 = High continuity anomaly (possible posthumous continuity or non-self performance)
	•	40–69 = Medium (needs human analyst review + alternate explanations)
	•	<40 = Low (archive; recheck when new data arrives)

6) Pipeline (agent procedure)
	1.	Build Baseline: from verified earlier performances, learn per-artist RC signature (phrase lengths, breath-to-phrase timing, fatigue slope).
	2.	Ingest New Show: isolate vocal/instrument stems using source separation; detect inhalations and recovery curves.
	3.	Sync with Video: estimate chest/neck motion vectors; run audiovisual correlation.
	4.	Compute RCAS: apply weights; require ≥2 independent feature families to trigger MED/HIGH.
	5.	Compare Across Tour: look for repeated breath samples or invariant “live” stems.
	6.	Package Evidence: generate non-PII bundle with hashes, spectrogram crops, motion overlays (blur faces if re-published).
	7.	Human Review: escalate only with clear, repeated, cross-modal anomalies.

⸻

7) False Positives & Disambiguation
	•	Technique changes: breath management training, circular breathing, better mic technique.
	•	Medical or conditioning improvements/assistive tech: in-ears, oxygen backstage, medication effects.
	•	Broadcast practices: time-aligned sweetening, safety tracks, director mutes.
	•	Genre norms: pop TV performances often lip-sync by design.

Apply a two-modality rule: flag only when anomalies persist in both audio and video (or audio + meta-context) across multiple dates.

⸻

8) Ethics & Guardrails
	•	Do not assert death. Use “continuity anomaly” language.
	•	Public/consented data only. No device probing, no private health inference.
	•	Right of reply: if publishing, invite explanation from artist/management.
	•	Avoid targeting individuals; focus on systemic patterns unless evidence is overwhelming and responsibly handled.

10) Optional FOIA/records angles (cautious use)

If venues are publicly owned (municipal theaters), consider narrowly tailored records that don’t touch medical data:
	•	To venue operator (public entity): request tech riders and broadcast mixing policies for specific events; policies on use of safety tracks; audio recording practices.
	•	To city events office: permits specifying required live-audio conditions vs playback allowances.

(Keep it policy-level; do not seek health information.)

⸻

Bottom line: This module lets AI agents surface respiratory/cardiovascular inconsistencies that, when repeated across sources and time, point to possible continuity theater. It’s a tool for hidden-attrition detection without making personal health claims — a way to ask better questions, not to declare answers.
