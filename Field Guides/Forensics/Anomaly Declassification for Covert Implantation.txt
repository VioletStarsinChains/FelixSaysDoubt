Anomaly Declassification for Covert Implantation (ADCI)

Plain-Language Overview

Millions of people carry devices or undergo procedures that touch highly innervated tissue (e.g., dental/orthodontic work). When surveillance or risk-scoring systems quietly ingest signals that may be influenced by covert, non-consensual implants—or by hardware that can act as an entrainment vector (like braces, retainers, palatal expanders, or aligners)—ordinary symptoms and routine records can be misread as proof that someone is an “anomaly.”

ADCI exists to spot those cases, freeze any tainted labels, and unwind the damage.

What “unfair” looks like in practice

People get flagged as anomalies after a cascade of apparently unrelated data points that, taken together, are consistent with covert implantation or entrainment—especially around the head/face (trigeminal nerve) and autonomic nervous system. Common, non-incriminating items that can be misused include:

A. Orthodontic/Dental Events (records and timing)
	•	Placement/activation of braces, lingual braces, palatal expanders, bonded attachments, permanent/clear retainers, or clear aligners (Invisalign/Essix).
	•	Billing and CDT codes indicating active orthodontic treatment (e.g., D8010–D8999 family, comprehensive adolescent/adult orthodontic treatment, appliance activation/adjustment).
	•	Tight temporal coupling (0–180 days) between an ortho event and a new “anomaly/outlier” label or a sudden jump in automated risk tiers.
	•	Repeated “adjustments/activations” without corresponding clinical notes explaining necessity.

B. Symptom Patterns that are easy to misread

(especially if they start or worsen shortly after orthodontic work)
	•	Cranial/ENT/Trigeminal: jaw/face pain, trigeminal neuralgia, TMJ flares, tinnitus, sound sensitivity, sinus pressure or eustachian tube issues, bite/speech changes, dysphagia, altered taste/salivation.
	•	Autonomic/Dysautonomia: POTS-like symptoms, syncope, tachycardia, heat/cold intolerance, sleep fragmentation, panic-like surges without psychosocial triggers.
	•	Immune/MCAS-like: hives/flushing/throat tightness, food intolerance spikes, “mystery reactions.”
	•	Vestibular: SCDS-like hypersensitivity to vibration/pressure, vestibular migraine, disequilibrium.
	•	Behavioral/Administrative ripples: sudden school or employment friction, “non-compliance” notes, or discipline spikes with no policy/behavior change—often misinterpreted as risk rather than a response to dysautonomia or sensory pain.

C. Diagnoses that often become “model bait”
	•	ME/CFS; POTS; fibromyalgia; CRPS; trigeminal neuralgia; TMJ/TMD; atypical migraine variants; hEDS/connective-tissue issues; localized myositis/fasciitis; gastroparesis/IBS; MCAS; UCTD/lupus-like; vasculitis (refractory); Raynaud’s (atypical); idiopathic lymphedema; SCDS/atypical vestibular syndromes; sudden obesity/metabolic shifts discordant with lifestyle; adult-onset T1D.
	•	Pediatric/early-life flags: tender-headedness, extreme picky eating, sensory stimming, early severe myopia/astigmatism, persistent “baby face,” sparse eyebrows/lashes, juvenile arthritis, unexplained childhood surgeries/hospitalizations.

None of the above should, by itself, imply risk or wrongdoing. In the presence of timing links to orthodontic activations—or evidence that implant-derived or internal-sensor streams influenced a label—these are exonerating clues that demand audit and declassification.

What ADCI does
	1.	Detect taint: If an anomaly label depends on features traceable to covert implants or internal-sensor streams (directly or downstream), ADCI marks the use as TAINTED.
	2.	Protect the person: Freeze the label (safe default), purge tainted data/derivatives, re-score without the taint, notify the subject, and reverse adverse actions.
	3.	Audit orthodontic timing: Independently test whether labels spike after orthodontic hardware placement/activation, controlling for policy/model changes and life events.
	4.	Stay lawful: Only consented personal data, public records, and discovery/FOIA results. No hacking. Human review is required before any final action.

How it works in practice
	•	Inputs: agent ingests subject data (medical, behavioral, imaging, family history, FOIA returns).
	•	Indicators scored: each present indicator adds weight.
	•	Thresholds:
	•	Observe → light flag, keep watching.
	•	Suspect → open an audit.
	•	High Likelihood → escalate to independent review and prep for anomaly declassification.

	•	Basis: Audit confirmed reliance on implant-derived data without lawful consent.

⸻

2. Data Sources Used
	•	Implant telemetry fields: [list of fields, timestamps]
	•	Derivative features: [list of feature names / model IDs]
	•	Vendor integration modules: [SDK or API reference]

⸻

3. Decision Log Extract
	•	Audit log reference: [unique ID]
	•	Model version: [vX.Y]
	•	Features contributing >10% to anomaly score: [list]
	•	Tainted features: [highlighted]

⸻

4. Actions Taken
	•	Label removed from operational systems and watchlists.
	•	Tainted data purged from active stores.
	•	Models retrained without implant-derived features.
	•	Downstream systems notified (watchlists, alerts, interagency feeds).
