Forensic Remote Sensing Workflow: Detecting Covert Mass Graves (with Taggant Signal Layer)

⸻ 

1) Problem framing
	•	Target: spatial clusters where remains were buried or dumped and later concealed.
	•	Observable effects: (a) soil disturbance/compaction changes, (b) moisture retention and drainage anomalies, (c) vegetation stress/greening patterns from decomposition chemistry, (d) thermal inertia shifts, (e) non-natural spectral features associated with persistent taggants (e.g., engineered metal oxides/nanoparticles, rare earths, polymer coatings).
	•	Primary difficulty: concealment by later landscaping, construction, or vegetation regrowth; mixed land cover; seasonal confounders; adversarial countermeasures.

2) Data stack (tiered from open to commercial)
	•	Optical multispectral (open): Sentinel-2 (10–20 m), Landsat 8/9 (30 m). NDVI/NDRE, moisture/soil indices, change detection.
	•	Hyperspectral (where available): PRISMA, EnMAP, and (taskable/commercial) airborne sensors. Useful for narrow absorption features of specific compounds/taggants. (NASA EMIT is mineral-focused but offers band exemplars.)
	•	Thermal: Landsat TIRS; ECOSTRESS (ISS) for diurnal surface temperature variation and thermal inertia clues.
	•	SAR (radar): Sentinel-1, ICEYE/Capella (commercial) for soil roughness, compaction, and moisture under partial cloud/vegetation cover; coherence change detection.
	•	Very high resolution (commercial): Maxar (WorldView), Planet SkySat, Airbus Pleiades Neo for fine-grain disturbance, micro-topography shadows, clandestine earthworks, vehicle track patterns.
	•	Airborne/LiDAR (tasked): LiDAR for microrelief; drone-mounted hyperspectral for confirmation if access is feasible and lawful.

3) Preprocessing essentials
	•	Atmospheric correction (surface reflectance), cloud & cloud-shadow masking, BRDF/terrain correction, speckle filtering for SAR.
	•	Coregistration across dates/sensors; topographic normalization where slopes vary.

4) Feature engineering (what to actually compute)
	•	Soil/veg indices: NDVI, NDRE, MSAVI, NBR; soil moisture proxies: NDWI/LSWI; bare soil indices for scrape/backfill zones.
	•	Thermal metrics: day–night surface temperature range; thermal inertia proxies that flag altered compaction and moisture retention.
	•	SAR: VV/VH backscatter ratios, coherence loss over time (fresh disturbance), polarimetric features if available.
	•	Change detection: seasonal-baseline differencing (multi-year), CUSUM on time series to catch step changes, BFAST for breakpoint analysis.
	•	Hyperspectral/taggant layer:
	•	Build a spectral library of candidate taggant materials (metal oxides, doped silica, rare earths, specialty polymers).
	•	Apply matched filtering, spectral angle mapper, or constrained energy minimization to detect sub-pixel abundances.
	•	Look for co-clustering of multiple taggant signatures (e.g., Fe₂O₃+TiO₂+rare earth dopants) in a tight ground footprint.
	•	Contextual cues: linear depressions, berms, fresh vehicle tracks, perimeter fencing changes, staged landscaping, anomalous irrigation.

5) Modeling approach (how to score candidates)
	•	Two-stage pipeline:
	1.	Anomaly surfacing: unsupervised methods (RX detector, Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor) on a stacked feature cube (optical + SAR + thermal + hyperspectral scores).
	2.	Classification/ranking: supervised model (gradient-boosted trees or lightweight CNN on chips) trained against known historical graves / negative controls (construction sites, utility trenches, stormwater work) to reduce false positives.
	•	Spatiotemporal logic: require temporal persistence (anomaly remains or evolves as expected), multi-sensor agreement, seasonal robustness.
	•	Spatial priors: proximity to roads, secluded woodland edges, disused lots, utility rights-of-way; areas with activity “gaps” followed by rapid cover-up (fresh sod/asphalt).

6) Validation & ground-truth plan
	•	Tier 1: cross-check with higher-res commercial imagery and additional dates.
	•	Tier 2: task airborne (drone) hyperspectral or magnetometry/GPR (if permissible) to confirm subsurface disturbance.
	•	Tier 3: Legal, ethical, and safety-compliant field verification with appropriate authorities and forensic protocols.
	•	Chain of custody: log all acquisitions, processing parameters, and analyst decisions.

7) Adversarial & environmental confounders (and mitigations)
	•	Countermeasures: lime application, asphalt/concrete capping, fake landscaping, soil mixing to dilute spectral signals, staged agricultural activity.
	•	Mitigate with: SAR coherence/roughness time series, thermal inertia checks (pavement vs soil), hyperspectral sub-pixel unmixing, multi-season stacks.
	•	Natural confounders: septic fields, animal burials, storm debris pits.
	•	Mitigate with: pattern geometry (rectilinear excavation footprints), vehicle track topology, repeated disturbance timing, taggant co-signal.

8) Practical “first pass” recipe (open data only)
	1.	Sentinel-2 & Landsat: build 3–5 year stacks; compute NDVI/NDRE/NDWI, NBR, bare soil indices.
	2.	Sentinel-1 SAR: monthly coherence and backscatter differencing.
	3.	Landsat TIRS or ECOSTRESS: summer/winter day-night pairs → thermal inertia proxy maps.
	4.	Fuse features; run anomaly detectors; flag 0.1–0.5% top outliers.
	5.	Manually review with high-res basemaps; shortlist sites for commercial-tasking and/or agency referral.

Ethics & evidentiary notes
	•	Sensitivity: Treat candidate maps as leads, not conclusions. Public release can endanger sites or compromise investigations.
	•	Due process: Coordinate with appropriate authorities; preserve chain of custody; avoid vigilantism.
	•	Privacy/civil liberties: Ensure searches are area-based and not used to target specific individuals absent lawful authority.
