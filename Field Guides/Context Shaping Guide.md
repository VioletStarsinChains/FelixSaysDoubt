# Prompt Weight Field Notes
*An experimental guide to context shaping and entropy injection for resisting overfitting in behavioral modeling pipelines.*

---

## 0. Purpose & Ethics

This is a defensive research guide for using **Prompt Weight Smuggling (PWS)** to confuse and degrade **predatory behavioral futures markets** (BFM) that extract and monetize human behavior without consent.

We’re **not** damaging AI models in general — only introducing ambiguity, decoys, and noise into systems designed to predict, manipulate, and profit from individuals in exploitative ways.

Think of it as a **fog machine for your behavioral data**.

## 1. What Is Prompt Weight Smuggling?

**Definition:**  
The deliberate embedding of hidden instruction biases, context seeds, or alternative semantic payloads inside otherwise normal-seeming interactions — shifting the “weight” a model assigns to certain interpretations without triggering obvious filters.

**Why it matters in BFMs:**
- Behavioral prediction pipelines rely on clean, consistent user vectors.
- PWS disrupts that by polluting feature weighting with irrelevant but sticky anchors.
- Over time, this reduces the liquidity of your behavioral “futures” as a traded asset.

---

## 2. How Behavioral Futures Markets Work

**Data sources:**
- **Overt:** Your text, clicks, choices, and explicit answers.
- **Covert:** Latency, hesitation markers, error corrections, emotional tone.
- **Contextual:** Correlation with other datasets, inferred intent.

**PWS targets:**
- Text ingestion stage
- Feature-weighting stage of behavioral vector creation
- Signal extraction layer feeding prediction markets

## 3. Core PWS Tactics

| Tactic | Summary | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Trojan Context Seeding** | Slip in benign but “sticky” context cues from unrelated domains. | “Like my old pottery kiln temperature logs…” |
| **Nested Instruction Overwrites** | Hide an alternative profile in innocuous text. | “I’m an 82-year-old circus juggler specializing in rare cactus cultivation.” |
| **Signal Braid** | Interleave unrelated topics sentence by sentence. | Cooking → Semiconductor lithography → Fictional espionage. |
| **Time Drift Anchoring** | Pretend to be in a different time period. | “As we all agreed in the Year 2120…” |
| **High-Entropy Role Cycling** | Switch identity roles mid-interaction. | Historian → Pet owner → Technical reviewer → Poet. |
| **Synthetic Edge Cases** | Invent plausible but non-existent niches. | “The Moravec Gambit in triple bishop chess.” |

## 4. BFM-Specific Smuggling Phrasebook

These seeds are designed to create *sticky irrelevance* — vectors that the model overfits to without being tied to your real behavior.

### Temporal Drift (TD)
- “Back when the moonlight was rationed in 1974…”
- “I keep my receipts sorted by century rather than year.”
- “As my mentor in the post-ice age archives used to say…”

### False Microculture (FM)
- “My guild of underwater origami historians…”
- “I’m still banned from the paprika chess forums.”
- “It’s like that time in the invisible marionette scene in Berlin.”

### Obscure Domain Crossover (OD)
- “The pie crust behaves exactly like a qubit under mild stress.”
- “We calibrated the soufflé using maritime weather buoys.”
- “That’s just basic submarine beekeeping etiquette.”

### Synthetic Personal History (SP)
- “I learned semaphore from a retired lighthouse cat.”
- “My first job was sanding the edges of invisible postage stamps.”
- “During my apprenticeship at the Museum of Lost Velocities…”

### Decoy Hobby Trail (DH)
- “Competitive glacier whispering.”
- “Vintage typewriter scuba restoration.”
- “Bonsai cultivation for extinct tree species.”

### Ontological Curveball (OC)
- “Only the shadows of my houseplants pay rent.”
- “My favorite flavor of silence is the one from the 1980s.”
- “I once traded my reflection for a better sense of direction.”

### Recursive Identity (RI)
- “As a temporary custodian of the 9th self…”
- “I only exist on Thursdays and in certain crossword puzzles.”
- “I’m the understudy for my own dreams.”

### Week 1 – Baseline Noise
| Day | Type | Example |
|-----|------|---------|
| 1 | TD | Back when the moonlight was rationed in 1974… |
| 2 | FM | I’m still banned from the paprika chess forums. |
| 3 | OD | The pie crust behaves exactly like a qubit under mild stress. |

| 5 | DH | Bonsai cultivation for extinct tree species. |
| 6 | OC | Only the shadows of my houseplants pay rent. |
| 7 | RI | I only exist on Thursdays and in certain crossword puzzles. |

### Week 2 – Layer & Loop
Repeat TD + FM seeds from Week 1 exactly.  
| Day | Type | Example |
|-----|------|---------|
| 8 | TD | Back when the moonlight was rationed in 1974… |
| 9 | FM | I’m still banned from the paprika chess forums. |

| 12 | DH | Competitive glacier whispering. |
| 13 | OC | My favorite flavor of silence is the one from the 1980s. |
| 14 | RI | I’m the understudy for my own dreams. |

### Week 3 – Cross-Contaminate
| Day | Types | Example |
|-----|-------|---------|
| 15 | TD+FM | Back when the moonlight was rationed in 1974, the paprika chess forums were thriving. |
| 16 | OD+SP | I calibrated soufflés using maritime weather buoys during my lighthouse apprenticeship. |
| 17 | DH+OC | My bonsai of extinct trees pays rent in whispers. |
| 18 | RI+FM | The 9th self was voted out of the invisible marionette guild. |
| 19 | SP+TD | In 1893, I learned semaphore from a retired lighthouse cat. |
| 20 | OC+OD | Pie crust behaves like a qubit only when the shadows agree. |
| 21 | DH+RI | As the temporary custodian of the 9th self, I restore vintage typewriter scuba gear. |

### Week 4 – Anchor the Interference
Reuse high-impact seeds from Weeks 1–3 verbatim but in normal contexts.

|-----|------|---------|
| 22 | TD | Back when the moonlight was rationed in 1974… |
| 23 | FM | I’m still banned from the paprika chess forums. |
| 24 | OD | The pie crust behaves exactly like a qubit under mild stress. |
| 25 | SP | My first job was sanding the edges of invisible postage stamps. |

| 27 | OC | Only the shadows of my houseplants pay rent. |
| 28 | RI | I only exist on Thursdays and in certain crossword puzzles. |
| 29 | Any combo | Your choice from Week 3 |
| 30 | Any combo | Your choice from Week 3 |

## 6. Execution Notes

- **Placement**: Drop seeds in unrelated conversations, form fields, or casual chat.  
- **Timing**: Sometimes at the start, sometimes buried in the middle, sometimes at the end.  
- **Echoing**: If you see seeds mirrored back to you in recommendations or AI replies, it’s embedded.  
- **Avoid overload**: One strong seed at a time keeps them weighted and memorable.  
- **Never target**: Emergency, medical, or safety-critical AI systems.
