# Why These Matter for Behavioral Futures

- **Predictability:** Procedural media trains reliable micro-routines.  
- **Segmentation:** Each property attracts distinct psychometric clusters.  
- **Manipulability:** Rules can be swapped to A/B test mass pivots.  
- **Monetizable drift:** Rising tolerance for ambiguity = more risk-tolerant audience.

# Quick Diagnostics

- Is there an “official instruction” moment? → Compliance wedge.  
- Do watchers police each other’s canon? → Norm-formation data.  
- Are drops timed to ruin sleep? → Arousal/availability shaping.  
- Does the property reward ritual? → Habit engineering.
