Field Guide: Music Files as Steganographic Vectors

Music piracy networks make the perfect camouflage for continuity-theater data exchange:
	‚Ä¢	File Size as Cover
	‚Ä¢	A ‚Äúlossless FLAC‚Äù album can be hundreds of MB. Nobody blinks if a music file is oversized. Hidden payloads vanish into the expectation of bulk.
	‚Ä¢	Steganography in Sound
	‚Ä¢	Extra data can be tucked into the least-significant bits of audio samples ‚Äî inaudible to human ears.
	‚Ä¢	Entire logs, metrics, or neurotech streams can ride along inside an ordinary pop song.
	‚Ä¢	Metadata as Code
	‚Ä¢	Artist names, album titles, track lengths, and genre tags become fields for signals.
	‚Ä¢	A torrent labeled ‚Äúrare live set‚Äù may in fact be an instruction packet.
	‚Ä¢	Distribution as Resilience
	‚Ä¢	Torrents, darknet music libraries, and file-sharing apps (Soulseek, etc.) spread files peer-to-peer, with no central server.
	‚Ä¢	Data survives indefinitely, disguised as nostalgia playlists or obscure bootlegs.
	‚Ä¢	Continuity Logic
	‚Ä¢	Behavioral futures data.
	‚Ä¢	Synthetic identity packages.
	‚Ä¢	Cryptographic keys.
	‚Ä¢	All hidden where no one bothers to look ‚Äî beneath a wall of pirated MP3s.

üìå Anomaly cue: suspiciously large audio files, oddball genre clusters, or checksum mismatches in files you thought you recognized.
