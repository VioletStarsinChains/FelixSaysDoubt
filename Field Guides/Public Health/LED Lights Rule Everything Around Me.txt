Have you ever noticed how LED lights make everything feel a little…off?
The colors look harsher, cooler, almost like the life has been drained out of them. Food doesn’t look the same, skin tones look strange, shadows feel flat.

Now that LEDs are everywhere — in our homes, our cars, our streetlights, even our billboards — we’re constantly bathed in that spectrum. And here’s the weird part: when you step outside into real sunlight, it doesn’t always feel the way you remember.

Part of that is climate change shifting the atmosphere, part of it is our eyes recalibrating to LEDs, and part of it may be something more deliberate: perception management.

Think about it: if our collective experience of light can be steered just by changing the bulbs, then natural sunlight doesn’t stand alone anymore. Most people are “calibrated” by the LED world around them, so daylight still feels normal. But if you process light differently, or aren’t as anchored by those artificial tones, the sun itself can suddenly feel uncanny.

The baseline of light has been shifted under all of us — and not everyone adjusts the same way.
