🏠 House Approach Checklist

1. Pause Before Entering Zone
	•	Stand still for ~30 seconds, breathe gently.
	•	Ask: Does my body feel a shift? (tightness, throat tickle, sudden heat/cold, dizziness, skin prickle, histamine surge).
	•	✅ If yes → treat as a signal to slow down or stop.

⸻

2. Visual Survey
	•	Windows/doors: Signs of black mold, heavy condensation, broken seals?
	•	Decor/markings: Hazmat-coded colors, unusual lawn/porch decor, or single-number anomalies.
	•	Utility features: Large copper wires, unmarked boxes, new venting or piping inconsistent with normal homes.
	•	Overgrowth: Sickly vegetation or strange bare patches near foundation.

⸻

3. Air & Odor Check
	•	Take a shallow sniff from outside (don’t inhale deeply).
	•	Red flags: sweet chemical smell, rotten-egg sulfur, solvent/varnish, excessive floral masking scents, or faint “dead animal” odor.
	•	✅ If mast cells flare here, count it as confirmation.

⸻

4. Quick Instrument Scan (if available)
	•	Geiger counter: Baseline background vs. sudden spike (5–10× higher = unsafe).
	•	EMF meter: Sudden jump near house perimeter (esp. if paired with MC flare).
	•	IR thermometer (optional): Hot spots in walls or ground that don’t match ambient air (could signal decomposing matter or hidden equipment).

⸻

5. Decision Point
	•	✅ Proceed if:
	•	Mast cells are calm.
	•	No red-flag visuals.
	•	No strong chemical/decay odors.
	•	Instrument readings at baseline.
	•	🚫 Withdraw if:
	•	Mast cells flare noticeably.
	•	Strong odor / visual anomaly is present.
	•	Instrument spikes confirm hazard.
	•	Gut feeling = “don’t go closer.”

⸻

6. Log Pattern Recognition
	•	Note what specifically triggered the reaction (odor, visual cue, mast cell symptom, instrument spike).
	•	Over time, you’ll build a pattern map of what your mast cells are responding to most consistently.
