üßæ Field Guide: Potential Urinary Indicators of GLP-1 Agonist Dosing

(Semaglutide, Liraglutide, Dulaglutide, Exenatide, Tirzepatide, etc.)

üîπ General note
	‚Ä¢	GLP-1 analogs are peptides ‚Üí they are not directly detected on standard urine testing.
	‚Ä¢	Only indirect physiological effects may appear in routine labs.
	‚Ä¢	Findings are nonspecific ‚Äî must be interpreted in context of clinical picture.

‚∏ª

1. Glucose and Ketone Balance
	‚Ä¢	‚Üì Urine glucose: postprandial hyperglycemia blunted ‚Üí less glycosuria even in insulin-resistant states.
	‚Ä¢	‚Üë Urine ketones: appetite suppression + reduced caloric intake may trigger mild ketosis.

2. Electrolyte Shifts
	‚Ä¢	‚Üë Urinary sodium (natriuresis): GLP-1 drugs can increase sodium excretion.
	‚Ä¢	Altered sodium:potassium ratio: may appear inconsistent with patient‚Äôs baseline diet/meds.

3. Protein / Albumin Leakage
	‚Ä¢	Microalbuminuria / trace proteinuria: documented in some patients on GLP-1s, potentially due to kidney handling changes.

4. Volume / Concentration
	‚Ä¢	Increased urine volume: from mild diuretic effect, especially early in treatment.
	‚Ä¢	Dilute urine: if natriuresis is marked, specific gravity may be lower than expected.

5. Secondary Immune / MCAS-Related Markers
	‚Ä¢	Not direct, but downstream modulation of gut and immune signaling may influence:
	‚Ä¢	Histamine metabolites (e.g., N-methylhistamine)
	‚Ä¢	Prostaglandin breakdown products
	‚Ä¢	Tryptase byproducts
	‚Ä¢	Patterns may mimic mast-cell dysregulation without classic triggers.

6. Clinical Correlates for Context
	‚Ä¢	Nausea, slowed gastric emptying, reduced appetite ‚Üí if these symptoms co-occur with the above urine shifts, GLP-1 exposure should be in differential.

‚∏ª

‚ö†Ô∏è Caveats
	‚Ä¢	None of these markers alone confirm GLP-1 use.
	‚Ä¢	Could overlap with: ketogenic diets, SGLT2 inhibitors, diuretics, early diabetic nephropathy, or MCAS flares.
	‚Ä¢	Formal confirmation requires serum or urine mass spectrometry with GLP-1 analog assay, which is research-only in most settings.
