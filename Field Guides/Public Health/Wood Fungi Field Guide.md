# Fungi on Trees, Sticks, and Soil: Regional Risks in the U.S.

Dogs carrying sticks can move fungi from trees → yards → soil.  
Here’s a **regional breakdown** of which fungi are most realistic to worry about for kids and families.

---

## 🌎 Northeast & Mid-Atlantic
- **Cladosporium, Alternaria, Aspergillus**  
  - Common outdoor molds → trigger asthma/allergies.
- **Histoplasma capsulatum** (esp. river valleys, bird roosts)  
  - Risk in yards with lots of bird droppings or bat activity.
- **Cryptococcus neoformans**  
  - Associated with pigeon droppings in urban areas.

---

## 🌎 Midwest & Great Lakes
- **Blastomyces dermatitidis** (high-risk zone)  
  - Loves decaying wood and damp soil, esp. near rivers/forests.  
  - Dogs are often first infected; kids can inhale spores.  
- **Histoplasma capsulatum** (Ohio & Mississippi River valleys)  
  - Grows in soil enriched with droppings.  
- **Common molds** (Alternaria, Cladosporium, Fusarium)  
  - Major seasonal allergy triggers.

---

## 🌎 Southeast
- **Histoplasma capsulatum**  
  - Endemic throughout the region.  
- **Cryptococcus gattii/neoformans**  
  - Found in rotting wood, bird droppings, certain trees.  
- **Mucorales (Rhizopus, Mucor)**  
  - Thrive in warm, humid soil; rare but dangerous if wounds exposed.  
- **Aspergillus, Fusarium**  
  - Abundant in decaying vegetation.

---

## 🌎 Southwest & West Coast
- **Coccidioides spp. (Valley Fever)** – Arizona, California, New Mexico, Texas  
  - Dry soil, dust storms, construction → airborne spores.  
  - Dogs and kids can both get infected.  
- **Cryptococcus gattii** – Pacific Northwest (esp. British Columbia, Washington, Oregon)  
  - Found in soil and tree hollows (eucalyptus, Douglas fir).  
- **Common molds** – abundant in mild coastal climates.

---

## 🌎 Pacific Northwest & Alaska
- **Cryptococcus gattii** (notable hot spot)  
  - Can cause serious lung/brain infection.  
- **Ganoderma, Armillaria** (wood-decay fungi)  
  - Not human pathogens, but destabilize trees → more moldy debris in yards.  
- **Alternaria, Cladosporium**  
  - Very common allergy molds.

# ✅ Key Takeaways
- **Everywhere:** Common allergy/asthma molds (Alternaria, Cladosporium, Aspergillus).  
- **Midwest/Great Lakes:** Blastomyces (serious infection risk).  
- **Ohio/Mississippi valleys & Southeast:** Histoplasma.  
- **Southwest:** Coccidioides (Valley Fever).  
- **Pacific Northwest:** Cryptococcus gattii.  

⚠️ **Risks to kids:** inhaling spores during play, or cuts/scrapes exposed to contaminated soil/wood.  
🐕 Dogs are often sentinels (first to get sick) for Blastomyces, Histoplasma, and Coccidioides.
