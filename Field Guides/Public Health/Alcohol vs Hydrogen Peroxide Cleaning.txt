Here’s a one-glance field chart you can keep in your head — a quick “grab this, not that” guide:

Peroxide vs. Alcohol Wipes – Field Chart

If it touches your mouth/eyes/contacts → 🫧 Peroxide
(safe in mouth, bubbles out debris)

If it’s electronics or smooth surfaces → ✨ Alcohol
(fast-dry, no residue)

If it’s porous / smelly / fabric → 👟 Peroxide
(soaks in, deodorizes, antifungal)

If it’s hands before eating (no water) → 🤲 Alcohol
(quick disinfect, dries fast)

If it’s a wound → 🩹 Peroxide once
(cleans safely — alcohol stings + delays healing)

If you only have seconds → ⏱ Alcohol
(wipe and go)

If you can let it sit and dry → 🌬 Peroxide
(deep clean, bubbles, deodorizes)

⸻

👉 Think:
	•	Peroxide = soak & bubble
	•	Alcohol = swipe & dry
