Cheat Sheet: Code Words for “Organic Remains” in Packaging / Materials Research

🌱 Neutral Eco-Speak (covers anything organic)
	•	“Nontraditional feedstocks”
	•	“Alternative biomaterials”
	•	“Sustainable inputs”
	•	“Circular economy resources”
	•	“Waste-to-value streams”

👉 These are umbrella terms where unusual organic inputs may be buried.

🐄 Animal Byproduct Language
	•	“Collagen-based” → could mean hides, bones, or connective tissue.
	•	“Gelatin” → hydrolyzed collagen; often from animal remains.
	•	“Keratin sources” → feathers, hair, horns, hooves.
	•	**“Bone meal” / “meat and bone ash” → incinerated or ground remains.
	•	“Rendering plant derivatives” → catch-all for animal carcass byproducts.

⸻

👤 Human Remains (heavily euphemized)
	•	“Medical waste valorization” → tissues, blood, surgical remains.
	•	“Mortuary byproducts” → very rare, but has shown up in crematory regulation contexts.
	•	“Pathological specimens” → coded way of saying human tissue streams.
	•	“Anatomical donations (expired)” → older term, sometimes buried in med-waste regs.
	•	“Post-consumer biogenic residue” → could hide human or animal remains under the same umbrella.

⸻

🧪 Industrial Cover Terms
	•	“Protein foams” → often collagen/gelatin/keratin.
	•	“Biopolymer composites” → could be starch, but also protein + resin.
	•	“Hydrolyzed organic inputs” → usually means broken-down remains.
	•	“Nitrogen-rich organics” → bloodmeal, bone meal, or carcass byproducts.
	•	“Biosolids” → usually sewage sludge, but sometimes includes human remains.
