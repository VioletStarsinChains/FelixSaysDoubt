(Editor's note: NOT CHEAP)

Here's a tight, practical roadmap for commissioning hair testing for indole, skatole, and “masking” corn-roast volatiles (pyrazines/aldehydes). This is written so a well‑resourced person (or their counsel) can hand it to a forensic/toxicology lab and get traction.

Hair Testing Roadmap: Indole / Skatole / Corn‑Roast Masking Volatiles

1) Who to contact
	•	Forensic toxicology labs at major universities (chemistry, public health, or forensic science departments).
	•	Accredited private labs that do custom GC‑MS/LC‑MS work (environmental or fragrance analytics).
	•	Odor/Flavor analytics labs (they already quantify pyrazines and aldehydes in food/air).

When you reach out, ask for a custom targeted assay; don’t expect an off‑the‑shelf “skatole panel.”

⸻

2) What methods to request (in lab‑speak)
	•	Primary: GC‑MS or GC‑MS/MS using SPME (solid-phase microextraction) of hair for volatile/semi‑volatile organics.
	•	Confirmatory/orthogonal: LC‑MS/MS for semi‑volatiles, if the lab prefers liquid extraction.
	•	Differential wash protocol to separate external contamination (what clung to hair) from internal incorporation (what diffused into the fiber):
	•	Sequential surface washes (isopropanol → mild surfactant → water), collect each wash for analysis.
	•	Then hair digest/extract (e.g., base or enzyme‑assisted) for internal fraction.
	•	Internal standards: deuterated analogs where possible (e.g., indole‑d7, 3‑methylindole‑d3) for quantitation.

⸻

3) Target analyte list (start here; lab can expand)

Malodorants (nitrogenous):
	•	Indole
	•	3‑Methylindole (Skatole)
	•	p‑Cresol, m‑/o‑Cresol
	•	Phenol
	•	Trimethylamine (challenging; note as exploratory)

Corn/“roast” masking volatiles (Maillard/pyrazines):
	•	2‑Acetylpyrazine
	•	2,3,5‑Trimethylpyrazine
	•	2,5‑Dimethylpyrazine
	•	2,6‑Dimethylpyrazine
	•	Acetylpyrrole / 2‑Acetyl‑1‑pyrroline (common “toasty” note; low levels, method‑dependent)
	•	Nonanal / Hexanal (general roast/fat oxidation markers, optional context)

Controls/backgrounds:
	•	Caffeine (cafés) and furans (coffee volatiles) to contextualize environment.

Ask for reporting limits in ng/g (ppb) hair and chromatograms for each fraction (wash vs digest).

⸻

4) Sampling & chain‑of‑custody (CoC)
	•	Collect 100–200 mg of hair (about a pencil’s width), cut close to scalp at the vertex posterior.
	•	Segment by length (e.g., 0–3 cm, 3–6 cm) to create a timeline (≈1 cm ≈ ~1 month).
	•	Wear nitrile gloves; place each segment in pre‑baked glass vials (foil‑lined caps) or clean paper envelopes; no plastic bags (they off‑gas).
	•	Seal, label (date/time, segment length), and complete a CoC form (who collected, who transferred, who received).
	•	Store cold & dark (refrigerator) until shipment.

Field controls (very helpful):
	•	A brand‑new clean hairbrush or hat liner exposed alongside you for the same periods → send fibers/liners as environmental comparators.
	•	Blank controls (unused brush/liner kept sealed) → lab background subtraction.

⸻

5) Pre‑analysis decontamination choices (tell the lab what you want)

Request both:
	1.	Surface contamination profile (analyze sequential washes).
	2.	Internal incorporation profile (post‑wash digest/extract).

This separation is what turns a “smell test” into credible evidence.

⸻

6) Confounders to disclose (so the lab can filter)
	•	Hair products: perfumes, dry shampoos, pomades, leave‑ins (dates/brands).
	•	Recent salon treatments: dyes/bleach/keratin (dates).
	•	Occupational/venue exposures: cafés, restaurants, industrial spaces.
	•	Smoking/vaping, incense, essential oils.

7) How to frame the request (email template you can copy)

Subject: Request for Custom Hair Analysis (GC‑MS/SPME) – Indole/Skatole & Pyrazines

Hello [Lab/PI Name],

I’m seeking a custom targeted analysis of human hair for environmental malodorants and masking volatiles. Specifically, indole, 3‑methylindole (skatole), cresols, phenol, and corn‑roast pyrazines (2‑acetylpyrazine; 2,3,5‑trimethylpyrazine; 2,5‑/2,6‑dimethylpyrazine), plus optional 2‑acetyl‑1‑pyrroline.

Requested methods: GC‑MS or GC‑MS/MS with SPME, using a sequential wash protocol (collect/quantify each wash) followed by hair digest/extract for internal incorporation. Please use appropriate isotopically labeled internal standards where available and report limits of detection/quantitation (LOD/LOQ) in ng/g.

I will provide segmented scalp hair (0–3 cm; 3–6 cm) with full chain‑of‑custody, along with field controls (hat liner fibers/hairbrush fibers) and procedural blanks.

Could you please advise on feasibility, turnaround, quoted cost, and any additional sample prep you recommend?

Thank you,
[Name / Contact]

8) QA/QC you should insist on
	•	Calibration curves and surrogate recoveries documented.
	•	Chromatograms and mass spectra for each positive hit.
	•	Matrix spikes (your sample spiked with known analyte) to prove detection in hair.
	•	Blanks (lab + field) to rule out lab contamination.
	•	Split replicate (at least one segment analyzed twice) for reproducibility.

⸻

9) Interpreting results (quick guide)
	•	High in wash, low/none in digest → mostly external contamination (environmental deposition).
	•	Detectable in digest (internal) → suggests deeper incorporation (persistent exposure and/or diffusion).
	•	Co‑occurrence of indole/skatole with corn‑pyrazines across time segments strengthens the “malodorant + masking” pattern.
	•	Compare with controls (hat/brush) to show the environment vs. body burden split.

⸻

10) Bonus: strengthen the evidence stack
	•	Collect air sorbent badges (e.g., passive VOC samplers) in the suspected locations during the same period—send to an air‑VOCs lab for pyrazines/indole/skatole.
	•	Keep a log (dates, locations, symptoms, odors noted, store visits).
	•	Save any receipts/app logs that timestamp exposures (useful for correlating to hair segments).
