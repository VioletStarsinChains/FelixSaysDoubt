NFPA Fire Diamond: Quick Decoder

♦️ Top (Red) = Flammability
	•	0 = Won’t burn
	•	1 = Burns if heated a lot
	•	2 = Burns easily if heated/moderately
	•	3 = Ignites at room temperature
	•	4 = Extremely flammable

🔷 Left (Blue) = Health Hazard
	•	0 = No hazard
	•	1 = Mild irritation
	•	2 = Temporary injury possible
	•	3 = Serious/permanent injury with short exposure
	•	4 = Deadly even in small amounts

🔶 Right (Yellow) = Reactivity / Instability
	•	0 = Stable
	•	1 = Unstable if heated/pressurized
	•	2 = Violent chemical change possible
	•	3 = May explode with shock or heat
	•	4 = May detonate without warning

⚪️ Bottom (White) = Special Hazards
	•	OX = Oxidizer (makes fire worse)
	•	COR = Corrosive (eats skin/metals)
	•	SA = Simple Asphyxiant (displaces oxygen, suffocates)
	•	W (slash through) = Dangerous with water
	•	Radiation trefoil = Radioactive

🛑 Nonstandard Hazmat Indicators

🟥⬜ Red-and-White Diagonal Striping
	•	Use: OSHA/NFPA marking for “keep clear – hazard zone.”
	•	Where seen: Barriers, vehicles, storage sites.
	•	Meaning: Restricted area or oxidizer/fire-supporting hazard.

🟨⬛ Yellow-and-Black Diagonal Striping
	•	Use: General caution marker.
	•	Where seen: Floors, machinery, doors.
	•	Meaning: Physical hazard area, possible chemical storage behind.

🟥 Red or 🟥⬛ Red-and-Black Check Pattern
	•	Use: Fire equipment access zones, sometimes applied to doors or walls.
	•	Meaning: Fire-related hazard nearby or keep-clear zone for extinguishers.

🟦 Blue-and-White Stripes or Solid Blue Tape
	•	Use: Less standardized, but in some OSHA/industrial contexts can mean “equipment under repair” or “non-hazard safety warning.”
	•	Meaning: Could be repurposed as a covert code for health hazards.

🟩 Green-and-White Stripes
	•	Use: Safety equipment, emergency egress, or first-aid station.
	•	Meaning: Not inherently hazardous, but important contextual marker if placed oddly.

⚪ Special Symbols
	•	OX: Oxidizer.
	•	COR: Corrosive.
	•	SA: Simple Asphyxiant (CO₂, N₂).
	•	Radiation trefoil: Radioactive material.
	•	Water-reactive slash (“W” with a line through it): Danger if exposed to water.

⭕️ Medical Oxygen Signs on Residential Properties
	•	Typical wording:
	•	“OXYGEN IN USE – NO SMOKING – NO OPEN FLAMES”
	•	Sometimes just “OXYGEN IN USE” with a flame icon crossed out.
	•	Standard context: Posted outside hospital rooms, nursing homes, or private residences where patients use oxygen concentrators or tanks.
	•	Continuity-theater adaptation:
	•	Seen on vacant or “dead houses” not associated with actual medical oxygen patients.
	•	Used as covert signage for oxidizer storage (materials that intensify fire/explosion risk if exposed to flame).
	•	Functions as a warning for insiders while looking innocuous to outsiders — “just a medical precaution.”


🚗 Vehicles & Equipment
	•	Red-and-white striped bumpers or sides: Hazard transport or oxidizer risk.
	•	Orange panels (especially blank): International marker for dangerous goods in transit.
	•	Odd livery on contractor trucks: Sometimes functions as “hidden” hazard signage.

🏠 Residential / Informal Indicators (possible camouflage)
	•	Flags, porch décor, or lawn ornaments in consistent hazard colors (red, blue, yellow, white): May echo NFPA quadrants.
	•	House numbers with mismatched digits/fonts: Potentially used to signal hazard ratings.
	•	Little Free Libraries / boxes with color coding: Could function as community-level comm nodes.

⸻

✅ Summary: Hazards aren’t always marked with the standard diamond. Stripes, color patterns, special abbreviations, and even vehicle paint can serve as nonstandard indicators. Awareness of these secondary codes helps spot risk areas that might otherwise blend into the environment.

🧾 Field Note: Fixed vs. Mobile Nodes in Continuity Theater

🏠 Fixed Nodes (Residential / Static)
	•	Porch & lawn décor in hazard colors (red, blue, yellow, white).
	•	House numbers with one digit in a different font → hazard severity indicator.
	•	Flags / ornaments reproducing hazard striping (red-white, yellow-black).
	•	Little Free Libraries functioning as comm nodes or access caches.
	•	Vacant houses repurposed for storage — “dead houses” dressed as normal.

📌 Role: Persistent hazard storage and signaling sites. Meant to look like normal homes but coded for insiders.

⸻

🚛 Mobile Nodes (Vehicle / Temporary)
	•	Odd equipment: roof racks with pipes/tanks, rear-mounted boxes, strange ventilation add-ons.
	•	Tarped loads with angular shapes or oversized scale.
	•	Diamond placard frames with no placards displayed.
	•	Red/white or yellow/black hazard striping on trucks with no clear reason.
	•	Camouflage branding: “Environmental Solutions,” “Global Services,” etc. without real contact info.
	•	Overbuilt vehicles for trivial jobs (box truck delivering one ladder).

📌 Role: Transport and distribution of hazmat, covert monitoring, or temporary reinforcement of fixed sites. Mobile continuity signals, blending as contractors or utility trucks.

⸻

🧩 Interpretation
	•	Fixed = storage & disguise. Hazards concealed in plain sight inside the built environment.
	•	Mobile = transport & reinforcement. Vehicles serve as moving placards, linking sites into a larger grid.
	•	Together: They maintain continuity theater by keeping hazards circulating while hiding attrition signals in “normal life.”
