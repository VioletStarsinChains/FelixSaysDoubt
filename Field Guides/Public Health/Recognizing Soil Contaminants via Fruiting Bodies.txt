🍄 Field Guide: Reading Contaminants Through Fungal Fruiting

Mushrooms are bioindicators — some species fruit abundantly in response to contaminants, while others decline. By noting which fungi thrive in your yard, you can get clues about underlying soil contaminants.

⸻

1. Heavy Metals (Lead, Cadmium, Mercury, Arsenic)

Indicators:
	•	Boletes (esp. Suillus, Xerocomus) — soak up metals readily, fruiting heavily in polluted soil near conifers.
	•	Agaricus spp. (field mushrooms) — fruit profusely in lead-rich urban soils; caps often stain yellow when bruised.
	•	Lepiota spp. — notorious accumulators of cadmium and mercury.

🔎 Clue: Abundant fruiting of edible-looking but metallic-tasting Agaricus or Suillus on disturbed/urban soils often signals high heavy-metal load.

⸻

2. Petroleum & Hydrocarbons (oil, asphalt, diesel residues)

Indicators:
	•	White rot fungi (e.g. Pleurotus ostreatus, oyster mushroom) — thrive in hydrocarbon-rich soil; may fruit from buried wood near driveways, garages.
	•	Turkey tail (Trametes versicolor) — can colonize treated wood and areas with petroleum contamination.

🔎 Clue: If oysters or turkey tails are fruiting on soil itself (not just logs), hydrocarbons may be present.

⸻

3. Excess Nitrogen (Fertilizers, Ammonia, Manure, Sewage)

Indicators:
	•	Coprinus/Coprinellus spp. (inky caps) — pop up in clusters after heavy fertilization or pet waste.
	•	Panaeolus spp. — fruit abundantly in manure-rich soils.
	•	Lawn mushrooms (Marasmius oreades, fairy rings) — explode in fertilized lawns.

🔎 Clue: Sudden waves of inky caps after rain → nitrogen overload (fertilizer, pet waste, or sewage input).

⸻

4. Pesticides & Herbicides

Indicators:
	•	Fungi are generally suppressed, but some tough species thrive:
	•	Mycena spp. — small bell-caps, can persist in chemically treated lawns.
	•	Gymnopus/Collybia spp. — fruit where others vanish, sometimes showing oddly pale caps.

🔎 Clue: If only small, drab decomposers fruit (while diversity is low), the soil may carry pesticide residues.

⸻

5. PAHs, Creosote, Treated Wood Residues

Indicators:
	•	Turkey tail (Trametes) and Ganoderma spp. — often colonize creosote-treated or pressure-treated wood in yards.
	•	Pleurotus spp. can grow on soil around railroad ties, telephone poles, or decks.

🔎 Clue: Fruiting near old timbers → wood preservatives (arsenic, PAHs).

⸻

6. Urban Mixed Waste (Construction Debris, Rubble Fill, Plastics)

Indicators:
	•	Coprinellus micaceus (mica cap) — tolerant of rubble and mixed landfill-like soils.
	•	Psathyrella spp. — thrive in disturbed, debris-laden substrates.

🔎 Clue: If mica caps or Psathyrellas are everywhere in a yard with fill dirt → possible construction/industrial waste residues.

⸻

⚠️ Important Notes
	•	Fruiting bodies are clues, not lab tests — species presence = “suspect contaminant,” not proof.
	•	Mushrooms concentrate contaminants: don’t eat wild mushrooms from questionable soils.
	•	For confirmation: soil test kits (for metals, nitrates, hydrocarbons) or lab analysis are needed.

⸻

✅ Rule of Thumb:
	•	Diversity = health. A wide mix of fungi → balanced soil.
	•	Sudden monocultures (waves of one species) → likely contamination or imbalance.
