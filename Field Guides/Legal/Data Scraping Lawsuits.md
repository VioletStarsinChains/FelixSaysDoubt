# Research Instructions: Platform Lawsuits Against Scrapers

This guide is for anyone trained in case law research (Lexis, Westlaw, Bloomberg, or even PACER).  
Goal: Track how platforms have used litigation to consolidate exclusive rights over datasets.

---

## 1. Core Cases to Start With
- **Facebook v. Power Ventures** (9th Cir. 2016)  
  - Early test of scraping under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA).  
- **LinkedIn v. hiQ Labs** (9th Cir. 2017, reheard 2022)  
  - Landmark case: scraping of public profiles challenged as CFAA violation.  
- **Facebook v. BrandTotal** (N.D. Cal. 2021)  
  - Concerned API scraping for ad analytics.  
- **Twitter v. Bright Data** (N.D. Cal. 2023)  
  - Focused on enforcement of terms-of-service as a barrier to scraping.  

---

## 2. Statutes & Doctrines to Track
- **CFAA (18 U.S.C. § 1030)** – most often invoked.  
- **Trespass to Chattels** – older common law claim, still used in early cases.  
- **Breach of Contract / Terms of Service** – fallback when CFAA shaky.  
- **Copyright & DMCA** – sometimes layered on (esp. if bots copied creative elements).  
- **Antitrust defenses** – rare, but raised by scrapers to argue monopoly control.

## 3. Research Queries
- `"scraping" + CFAA`  
- `"unauthorized access" + LinkedIn`  
- `"trespass to chattels" + Facebook`  
- `"data ownership" + exclusive rights + antitrust"`  
- `"terms of service" enforcement + scraping"`  

---

## 4. What to Pull
- **Complaints** (plaintiff framing: data = property, scraping = theft).  
- **Motions for summary judgment** (arguments about statutory scope).  
- **Appellate briefs** (policy-level arguments: innovation vs. monopolization).  
- **Amicus briefs** (where agencies or trade groups weigh in).  
- **Court opinions** (final holdings, esp. dicta on data ownership).  

---

## 5. Agencies to Cross-Check via FOIA
- **FTC** – competition, consumer protection.  
- **DOJ Antitrust Division** – consolidation of data markets.  
- **CISA / DHS** – scraping framed as cybersecurity issue.  
- **USPTO / Copyright Office** – if platforms argue scraping = IP violation.  

---

## 6. Patterns to Watch For
- Platforms consistently reframe **data as quasi-property**.  
- Courts oscillate between **public interest in open web** vs. **platform control**.  
- Increasing reliance on **ToS enforcement** as backstop when CFAA narrowed.  
- Amicus briefs show **government stance** on data monopolization.

## 7. Deliverables
- A timeline of landmark scraper litigation.  
- A list of statutes most successfully weaponized against scrapers.  
- Identification of government agencies appearing in amicus briefs.  
- Notes on how judicial reasoning shifts toward recognizing “exclusive rights” to datasets.
