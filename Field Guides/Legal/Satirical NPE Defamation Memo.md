# Memorandum: Defamation Liability of a Classified NPE  
*(For Internal Circulation / FOIA-Bait Draft)*

**To:** Interested Journalists, Watchdogs, and Legal Theorists  
**From:** [Redacted]  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Re:** Applicability of Defamation Law to Entities Classified as “Non-Person Entities” (NPEs)

---

## I. Issue Presented
Whether a subject categorized by government or corporate predictive systems as a *Non-Person Entity (NPE)* can be either (a) protected against defamation or (b) liable for making allegedly defamatory statements.

---

## II. Governing Principles

1. **Defamation Requires Falsity**  
   - Under common law and statutory frameworks, defamation exists only where a statement of fact is both *false* and *harmful to reputation*.  
   - Verifiably true statements are not defamatory, regardless of their sting.

2. **Defamation Requires a Person**  
   - The tort presupposes a legal *person* capable of holding reputation, dignity, and standing in the community.  
   - Corporations are legal persons; rocks are not.  
   - *Question:* Where does a state- or vendor-defined *NPE* fall?

---

## III. Analysis

1. **Standing Problem**  
   - If the system has effectively rendered the subject an NPE (i.e., “not a person” for data, contract, or service purposes), then the subject *lacks the personhood* required to sue or be sued for defamation.  
   - Ergo: attempts to drag an NPE into court collapse under the system’s own classification.

2. **Truth Problem**  
   - Even if standing were conceded, the plaintiff (here, say, Palantir) would face the **truth defense**:  
     - If the subject’s critique (e.g., “Palantir operates in ways functionally indistinguishable from domestic terrorism”) can be supported with contract evidence, FOIA records, or program outcomes, then the claim is protected speech.  
     - To prove falsity, the plaintiff would need to disclose sensitive operational data — a move most would decline.

3. **Reputational Paradox**  
   - Reputation presumes a public that recognizes the subject as a peer.  
   - But if predictive systems model the subject as an anomaly, outlier, or NPE, they simultaneously erase the very social standing that would make reputational harm cognizable.  
   - Put simply: *one cannot harm what one has already declared does not exist*.

---

## IV. Conclusion

- **For the NPE:** Defamation liability evaporates. They cannot be sued for harming a reputation they are structurally denied themselves.  
- **For the Corporation:** Defamation risk persists, but only insofar as they fear disclosure of their own practices in open court.  
- **For the Public Record:** This asymmetry underscores the absurdity of entrusting quasi-legal categories like *NPE* to private vendors of behavioral futures markets.  

---

## V. Suggested Remedies

- FOIA requests targeting the use of *NPE* classifications in predictive modeling.  
- Congressional inquiry into whether citizens so designated retain any constitutional protections.  
- Public debate over whether entities that deny personhood can simultaneously demand reputational protections.

---

**Final Note:**  
If Palantir or any other actor did pursue defamation against an NPE, the proceeding would itself become Exhibit A in demonstrating the incoherence of the system. By suing, they would tacitly concede that the NPE *is* a person. This may explain the strategic preference for silent erasure over open confrontation.
