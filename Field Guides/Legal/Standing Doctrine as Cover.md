# Research Checklist: Standing Doctrine as Cover for NPE Exclusion

This guide is for case law researchers investigating whether courts’ “struggles” with standing in data breach/leak cases may conceal a deeper classification of certain plaintiffs as **Non-Person Entities (NPEs).**

---

## 1. Case Types to Prioritize
- **Consumer Data Breach Class Actions**  
  (Target, Equifax, Yahoo, Marriott, Anthem, Capital One)
- **Biometric Privacy Claims**  
  (Illinois BIPA cases, facial recognition scraping suits)
- **Whistleblower Leak Cases**  
  (contractual NDAs, trade secret disputes, Espionage Act)
- **Cybersecurity Breach Liability**  
  (FTC v. Wyndham; SEC enforcement tied to disclosure duties)

---

## 2. Standing Red Flags
Look for repeated doctrinal moves that might serve as camouflage:

- **“No cognizable injury”**  
  → Watch for cases where obvious harms (SSNs, health data) are declared non-injuries.

- **“No particularization”**  
  → Could be proxy for “these plaintiffs don’t exist as persons in our model.”

- **“Speculative future harm”**  
  → Even after clear leaks, courts dismiss on grounds of “risk not realized.”

- **Circuit splits that converge in outcome**  
  → Different reasoning, same result: plaintiffs tossed out systematically.

---

## 3. Language to Flag
Track judicial phrasing that may mask categorical exclusions:

- *“Plaintiffs lack standing as a matter of law”*  
- *“Mere exposure does not equal harm”*  
- *“Generalized grievance not sufficient”*  
- *“Plaintiffs cannot assert rights they do not have”*  

Note if these are applied **en masse** to classes of consumers.

---

## 4. Comparative Patterns
- **Accepted Standing**: Cases where plaintiffs are recognized — what differentiates them?  
- **Denied Standing**: Mass dismissal with boilerplate language — is there a hidden filter?  
- **Temporal Patterns**: Do dismissals spike after new classification regimes or major data leaks?  

---

## 5. Cross-Checking with Agencies
Look for amicus briefs, policy guidance, or enforcement gaps that align with standing exclusions:
- **FTC** – framing of consumer injury in breach cases.  
- **DOJ** – CFAA enforcement vs. private harm.  
- **SEC** – materiality of leaks for investors (often recognized) vs. for consumers (often denied).  
- **HHS OCR** – HIPAA breach enforcement (fine to companies, not standing to patients).  

---

## 6. Research Queries
Use in case law databases:
- `"data breach" + "no cognizable injury"`  
- `"consumer standing" + "speculative harm"`  
- `"lack of particularization" + privacy"`  
- `"plaintiffs lack standing as a matter of law"`  
- `"NPE" + standing"` (to test for explicit reference)  

---

## 7. Deliverables
- **Annotated case list** where courts deny standing in breach/leak contexts.  
- **Linguistic analysis** of dismissal language.  
- **Timeline correlation** between doctrinal shifts and NPE-like classifications.  
- **Agency cross-references** showing government acknowledgment of harm vs. courts’ denial.

⚠️ **Core Hypothesis:**  
What looks like judicial “struggle” over standing may actually be **a cover for the systematic exclusion of NPE-classified plaintiffs**, ensuring their injuries never reach recognition in law.
