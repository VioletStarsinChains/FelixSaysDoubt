# Research Instructions: Case Law on Data Leaks and Breaches

This guide is for researchers trained in case law and statutory research.  
Goal: Map how courts and agencies treat **data leaks** (breaches, hacks, whistleblowing), especially regarding ownership, liability, and control.

---

## 1. Core Legal Arenas

- **Data Breach Litigation**
  - Consumer class actions after major breaches (Target, Equifax, Yahoo, Marriott).
  - Questions: What counts as "injury"? Who has standing to sue?

- **Whistleblower & Leak Cases**
  - Cases under the Espionage Act (e.g., Manning, Snowden).
  - Civil suits involving NDA breaches or contract-based confidentiality.
  - Tension between "public interest" and "property/security."

- **Cybersecurity Breach Liability**
  - State laws: California CCPA, Illinois BIPA, New York SHIELD Act.
  - Federal enforcement: FTC data security cases (e.g., FTC v. Wyndham Worldwide).

## 2. Statutes & Doctrines to Track

- **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)** – invoked against hackers and sometimes whistleblowers.
- **Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA)** – covers interception/disclosure of electronic communications.
- **Trade Secret Law (DTSA, state UTSA)** – companies framing leaks as theft of proprietary data.
- **Privacy Statutes** – HIPAA, BIPA, GLBA (for specific data types).
- **Whistleblower Protections** – e.g., False Claims Act, Dodd-Frank, Sarbanes-Oxley.
- **Espionage Act** – applied in national security leak prosecutions.

## 3. Research Queries

- `"data breach" + standing + class action`  
- `"consumer injury" + Target breach`  
- `"trade secrets" + leak + proprietary data`  
- `"whistleblower" + data disclosure"`  
- `"FTC" + "data security enforcement"`  
- `"Equifax" + "settlement" + "court opinion"`  

---

## 4. What to Pull

- **Complaints** (how plaintiffs frame harm — loss of privacy, identity theft risk).  
- **Motions to dismiss** (defendants arguing no standing, no actual harm).  
- **Settlements** (what remedies companies agree to).  
- **Agency enforcement actions** (FTC, SEC, HHS).  
- **National security leak opinions** (if public filings exist).  

---

## 5. Agencies to Cross-Check via FOIA

- **FTC** – enforcement actions on consumer data breaches.  
- **SEC** – disclosure rules for public companies (e.g., SolarWinds).  
- **CISA/DHS** – federal response to critical infrastructure leaks.  
- **DOJ** – CFAA enforcement, Espionage Act prosecutions.  
- **HHS OCR** – HIPAA breach enforcement.  

---

## 6. Patterns to Watch For

- Courts often struggle with **standing** (is fear of identity theft an injury?).  
- Corporations push to frame leaks as **trade secret theft** vs. consumer harm.  
- Agencies position themselves as **regulators of security practices**, not privacy advocates.  
- National security leaks treated differently — **property → security → loyalty** frameworks dominate.  
- Settlements often emphasize **compliance programs** over consumer redress.

## 7. Deliverables

- Timeline of landmark breach/leak cases.  
- Breakdown of standing doctrine in consumer breach suits.  
- Agency enforcement trends by sector (financial, health, infra).  
- Comparative treatment: **consumer data breach vs. whistleblower leak vs. state-backed hack.**
