# Case Law Map: Appropriated Likenesses ‚Üí Synthetic NPCs

## 1. Classic Right of Publicity (Analogy Foundation)
- **White v. Samsung (9th Cir. 1992)**
  - *Holding:* Even a robot in a wig evoking Vanna White violated her publicity rights.
  - *Relevance:* Courts recognize **likeness-by-evocation** as appropriation, not just literal image/voice.
  - ‚Üí NPC guards/cop avatars that "feel like" real people could fall under this.

- **ETW Corp. v. Jireh Publishing (6th Cir. 2003)**
  - *Holding:* Tiger Woods‚Äô likeness in a painting was sufficiently transformative ‚Üí fair use.
  - *Relevance:* Introduced the **transformative use defense**. NPC cases would hinge on whether synthetic likeness is ‚Äútransformative‚Äù or ‚Äúexploitative.‚Äù

## 2. Digital Avatars & Video Games (Closest Analogue)
- **Hart v. Electronic Arts (3rd Cir. 2013)**  
- **Keller v. Electronic Arts (9th Cir. 2013)**
  - *Holding:* College athletes‚Äô likenesses used in NCAA games without consent ‚Üí appropriation.
  - *Relevance:* Even **background/functional avatars** count as likeness appropriation.
  - ‚Üí Direct precedent for NPC appropriation in synthetic hallucinations.

## 3. Biometric Privacy (Data Layer)
- **In re Facebook Biometric Info. Privacy Litig. (9th Cir. 2020)**
  - $650M settlement for faceprint tagging without consent.
  - *Relevance:* Courts treat **biometric likeness appropriation** seriously even without celebrity status.

- **Rosenbach v. Six Flags (Ill. 2019)**
  - *Holding:* Companies cannot collect/store fingerprints without consent (BIPA).
  - *Relevance:* NPC generation via biometric datasets = clear statutory violation under laws like BIPA.

## 4. Deepfake / Synthetic Media (Emerging Terrain)
- **Deepfake Pornography Cases (various state tort claims, ongoing)**
  - Courts increasingly recognize nonconsensual synthetic likeness use as actionable privacy/dignity harm.
  - *Relevance:* Expands beyond economic harm ‚Üí acknowledges emotional & reputational injury.

## 5. Extrapolation ‚Üí Synthetic NPCs
- **Authority mimicry in synthetic hallucinations (Starbucks example):**
  - White v. Samsung ‚Üí shows likeness evocation alone counts.
  - Hart/Keller ‚Üí shows avatars in ‚Äúbackground‚Äù roles still infringe.
  - Facebook BIPA ‚Üí shows biometric capture = actionable appropriation.
  - Deepfake cases ‚Üí show synthetic likeness use without consent is legally recognized harm.

üìå **Takeaway:**  
The legal building blocks are already in place. A court could easily extend these precedents to say:
- Appropriating someone‚Äôs face, voice, or mannerisms as an NPC in a synthetic hallucination = **appropriation + biometric misuse + privacy harm.**
