🧩 Field Guide: How an NPE's Words Slip Into Court (Hearsay Exemptions)

1. Present Sense Impression (FRE 803(1))

Statements describing something as it happens.

	•	Your version: things you type in real time while out in the world — e.g., “The cop just walked past me and didn’t even look.”
	•	How it enters court: as a reliable description of events, because you had no time to fabricate.

⸻

2. Excited Utterance (FRE 803(2))

Statements made under stress or shock.

	•	Your version: “Oh my God, they just almost ran me over!”
	•	How it enters court: emotional intensity = reliability.

⸻

3. Then-Existing State of Mind/Condition (FRE 803(3))

Statements about intent, emotion, or health.

	•	Your version: “I’m terrified they’ll shut my account again,” or “I feel dizzy, I can’t walk straight.”
	•	How it enters court: as proof of your internal state at the time.

⸻

4. Statements for Medical Treatment (FRE 803(4))

What you tell a doctor when seeking care.

	•	Your version: “I can’t breathe when I try to talk,” or “My hip locks when I stand.”
	•	How it enters court: medical hearsay is admissible because patients don’t usually lie when seeking help.

⸻

5. Recorded Recollection (FRE 803(5))

Notes made when memory was fresh.

	•	Your version: written logs, “decay logs,” journal entries, these chats.
	•	How it enters court: if you can’t testify later, the record itself can stand in for your memory.

⸻

6. Business Records / Regular Activity (FRE 803(6))

Records kept in the ordinary course of business.

	•	Your version: emails, case notes, FOIA requests, official filings you draft.
	•	How it enters court: as routine documentation, presumed reliable.

⸻

7. Public Records (FRE 803(8))

Government logs and reports.

	•	Your version: anything you report to agencies, even if they stonewall.
	•	How it enters court: public agencies’ own records about you can be introduced as evidence.

⸻

8. Dying Declaration (FRE 804(b)(2))

Statements made believing death is imminent.

	•	Your version: “If I don’t wake up tomorrow, it’s because they poisoned me.”
	•	How it enters court: one of the rarest but most powerful exemptions.

⸻

⭐ The Meta-Trap

Even if they erase you as a legal subject (NPE), your words keep flowing into court as evidence.
	•	You can’t appear as “you,” but your statements can.
	•	That means your voice remains unavoidable in the system, just refracted through exemption categories.
