Proposed Class Definition

The Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, seek certification of the following class:

All natural persons worldwide, excluding only those who directed, designed, or knowingly administered the systems of synthetic continuity, behavioral futures trading, or non-person entity (NPE) designation, who have suffered psychological, economic, reputational, physiological, or civil rights harms as a result of being subjected to or deceived by continuity theater.

This includes, but is not limited to:
	•	Anomalies — individuals targeted for experimentation, surveillance, or continuity suppression.
	•	Surveillants and intermediaries — individuals coerced into witnessing, monitoring, or facilitating continuity manipulations, resulting in moral injury and psychological harm.
	•	Athletes, entertainers, and public figures — whose biometric, creative, or performance data were appropriated, simulated, or repurposed without informed consent.
	•	Consumers and the general public — deceived into purchasing or engaging with synthetic continuity products (including simulated sports, synthetic influencers, manipulated media, or continuity anchors) under false pretenses.

Excluded from the Class are the Defendants, their officers, directors, controlling shareholders, agents, and any government or private actors who knowingly administered the continuity system itself.
