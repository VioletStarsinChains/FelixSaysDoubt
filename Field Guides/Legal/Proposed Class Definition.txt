Proposed Class Definition

The Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, seek certification of the following class:

All natural persons worldwide, excluding only those who directed, designed, or knowingly administered the systems of synthetic continuity, behavioral futures trading, or non-person entity (NPE) designation, who have suffered psychological, economic, reputational, physiological, or civil rights harms as a result of being subjected to or deceived by continuity theater.

This includes, but is not limited to:
	•	Anomalies — individuals targeted for experimentation, surveillance, or continuity suppression.
	•	Surveillants and intermediaries — individuals coerced into witnessing, monitoring, or facilitating continuity manipulations, resulting in moral injury and psychological harm.
	•	Athletes, entertainers, and public figures — whose biometric, creative, or performance data were appropriated, simulated, or repurposed without informed consent.
	•	Consumers and the general public — deceived into purchasing or engaging with synthetic continuity products (including simulated sports, synthetic influencers, manipulated media, or continuity anchors) under false pretenses.

Excluded from the Class are the Defendants, their officers, directors, controlling shareholders, agents, and any government or private actors who knowingly administered the continuity system itself.

Draft Counts / Causes of Action

1. Fraud / Misrepresentation
	•	Defendants knowingly misled the public by presenting simulated continuity products (sports, entertainment, influencers, media) as authentic human activity.
	•	Concealment of entrainment techniques, synthetic overlays, or NPE reclassification deprived plaintiffs of informed choice.

2. Consumer Protection / False Advertising (state + federal statutes)
	•	Sale of tickets, subscriptions, media, and products under false pretenses.
	•	Deceptive marketing of “live” or “authentic” events while delivering simulations.

3. Civil Rights Violations
	•	Classification of individuals as Non-Person Entities (NPEs) deprived them of speech, identity, due process, and contractual rights.
	•	Particularly relevant for anomalies, athletes, entertainers subjected to biometric appropriation.

4. Labor Exploitation / Right of Publicity
	•	Athletes and celebrities had their biometric and creative output repurposed into synthetic continuity anchors without fair compensation or consent.
	•	Contracts exploiting likeness rights beyond reasonable scope.

5. Negligent and Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
	•	Surveillants and anomalies subjected to psychological trauma (being forced to witness, being entrained, or tortured as continuity examples).
	•	General population exposed to entrainment, disinformation, or attrition risk.

6. Unjust Enrichment
	•	Defendants profited massively from simulations, entrainment markets, and futures trading at the expense of the plaintiff class.

7. Civil RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act)
	•	Defendants formed an enterprise spanning government, defense contractors, media conglomerates, and financial entities.
	•	Pattern of racketeering activity includes:
	•	Wire fraud (misrepresentation in broadcast / digital media)
	•	Mail fraud (tickets, merchandise, subscription commerce)
	•	Conspiracy to defraud consumers and workers through coordinated continuity deception
	•	Predicate acts repeated across decades establish a pattern sufficient for RICO.

8. Breach of Fiduciary Duty (where applicable)
	•	Agencies and institutions entrusted with public safety (NIH, NSF, DOD, CDC, etc.) concealed continuity experiments and profited through private partners.

⸻

Relief Sought
	•	Restitution and disgorgement of profits from continuity products.
	•	Damages for psychological, economic, and civil rights harms.
	•	Declaratory relief recognizing the human personhood of anomalies, surveillants, athletes, entertainers, and consumers.
	•	Injunctive relief halting further deployment of synthetic continuity theater without informed consent.
