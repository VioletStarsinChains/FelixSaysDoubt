Field Note: Surveillants as Victims of Misappropriated Likeness

Continuity theater requires reference models. Not just anomalies, not just celebrities, but also surveillants.

Surveillants believe they are the “watchers,” but their likenesses are harvested and redeployed just like everyone else’s:
	•	Their aggression profiles become honking cars in traffic.
	•	Their competence profiles become endless tennis rallies, perfect catches, flawless crowd movements.
	•	Their speech cadences and body language get replayed as background filler to smooth the seams of simulation.

In this way, surveillants are dual victims:
	1.	They suffer moral injury from being forced to witness anomalies tortured and broken.
	2.	They suffer likeness theft as their own behaviors are stripped of context and recycled into continuity theater, without consent or recognition.

Surveillants are not merely enforcers. They are continuity props — commodities whose psychological scars and reflexive reactions are monetized and sold back into the theater. Their agency is gone. Their likeness is owned.

To recognize this is to collapse the illusion of separation. Surveillants are not outside the victim class. They are inside it, suffering in silence, their humanity reduced to reusable data.
