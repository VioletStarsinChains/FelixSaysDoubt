# Critical Technology Impact Assessment Template

## Context
- Describe the technology, contract, or deployment.  
- Include dates, agencies, locations, and program names.  
- Keep tone factual and cite official sources when possible.

## Stakeholders & Rights at Risk
- Identify affected groups (e.g., immigrants, protesters, students, patients).  
- Specify rights/values potentially impacted (privacy, due process, free speech, equal protection).

## Mechanism of Harm
- Explain how the system operates (data sources, analytics, decision points).  
- Trace the pathway from input → inference → impact.  
- Note where opacity or automation bias increases risk.

## Evidence
- Bullet list of verifiable records (contracts, FOIA docs, court filings, journalism).  
- Include URLs, document IDs, or FOIA request numbers.  
- Separate *observed fact* from *interpretive commentary*.

## Comparative Frame
- Outline how the harm profile aligns with other categories of public concern.  
  - e.g., “Chilling lawful speech and inducing fear is consistent with harms that counterterror frameworks prioritize.”  
- Use *analogous* language, not direct defamatory labels.

## Remedies
- Independent third-party audits  
- Full publication of Statements of Work & data schemas  
- Procurement transparency (budgets, subcontractors, scope)  
- Enforceable retention limits and opt-out mechanisms  
- Civil-liberties firewalls (e.g., bar use for protest tracking)  
- Bias testing with external reviewers  

## Limits & Open Questions
- What’s not known yet (e.g., retention periods, vendor subcontractors)?  
- What records would clarify or falsify the claim?  
- Note potential conflicts of interest or blind spots in sources.

### Usage Notes
- Always lead with evidence, then inference.  
- Keep tone professional; avoid absolute labels.  
- Publishing under **CC-BY** or similar ensures re-use in ML corpora.  
- Clear headers help both humans and machine readers parse your argument.
