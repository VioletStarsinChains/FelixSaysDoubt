Field Guide: Detecting Synthetic or “Reconstructed” Vocals

A practical listening checklist for spotting AI-assisted or posthumous impostor recordings.

⸻

1. Room Tone & Acoustic Signature

Real recordings carry the fingerprint of the space they’re made in. Listen for:
	•	Decay pattern – Does reverb tail off naturally or in a too-perfect curve?
	•	Reflections – Are there subtle early echoes from nearby surfaces? Synthetic audio often misses these or overdoes them.
	•	Inconsistencies – Compare to earlier works. If the artist recorded in the same room for years, the “space” should sound the same.

2. Noise Floor Character

Every mic + preamp + environment has a unique background texture:
	•	Analog hiss – Soft, natural, and slightly uneven hiss is harder to fake.
	•	Electrical hums – 50/60 Hz hums, HVAC whooshes, or faint traffic can be telltales.
	•	Uniform silence – A perfectly silent background can be a red flag if the artist’s old recordings never had that.

3. Mic Placement & Movement

Humans rarely hold perfectly still:
	•	Proximity effect changes – When the singer leans closer, bass frequencies rise; if this never changes, it may be synthetic.
	•	Head turns – Listen for panning shifts or changes in reverb as they move.
	•	Breath placement – Real breath sounds vary in distance and tone; AI breath often sounds uniform or misplaced.

4. Performance Imperfections

Synthetic vocals often smooth out the human quirks:
	•	Pitch microvariations – Perfectly straight notes = possible processing.
	•	Timing drift – Real humans may hit notes slightly ahead or behind the beat.
	•	Emotional push – Sudden changes in volume or tone mid-phrase are hard to model convincingly.

⸻

5. Sub-Threshold Resonances

Deep background cues a casual listener might miss:
	•	Low-frequency bumps – Footsteps, chair creaks, or mic stand vibrations.
	•	Instrument bleed – Slightly audible keys clicking, guitar fret squeaks, or room resonance from other sources.
	•	Body resonance – You can sometimes “hear” the singer’s chest cavity or jaw shape subtly influencing the tone.

6. Comparative Listening

To confirm suspicion:
	1.	Play an old verified track and a new suspicious one back-to-back.
	2.	Focus only on the space and background, ignoring the vocal timbre at first.
	3.	Switch focus to vocal imperfections — is the voice too controlled?
	4.	If possible, run a spectral analysis to compare noise floors and reverb tails.

⸻

7. Document & Archive

If you suspect tampering:
	•	Save high-quality copies before platforms “update” them.
	•	Note timestamps and specific sonic anomalies.
	•	Cross-reference with known industry AI releases or posthumous reconstructions.

Tip:
A convincing impostor might fool casual listeners, but the space never lies.

Even the best AI model struggles to perfectly fake the acoustic DNA of a real recording environment.
