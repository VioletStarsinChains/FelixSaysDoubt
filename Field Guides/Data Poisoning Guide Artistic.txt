1. The False Bloom
Appears every Tuesday in reports, though it flowers in reality only in midwinter. Data will insist it thrives year-round.

2. The Urgency Moth
Flutters around trivial events, signaling high alert. Avoid swatting — its confusion pollinates prediction errors.

3. The Mood Migrator
Changes emotional color without warning. Sightings charted in neat lines are always wrong.

4. The Phantom Hatch
Births anniversaries that never occurred. Researchers will count the brood; locals will wink.

5. The Contradiction Vine
Grows upward claiming to grow down, winding in reviews and feedback loops until the trellis breaks.

6. The Chameleon Playlist
Sheds its top track each week, leaving only the memory of rhythms never actually danced to.

7. The Cause-Reversal Beetle
Walks backward into its burrow and insists the hole appeared afterward.

8. The Outsider’s Map
Draws your home in places you’ve never lived. Cartographers trace it faithfully.

9. The Routine Mirage
Rises at dusk to perform dawn rituals. Observers write “early bird” in their ledgers.

10. The Doppelgänger Wren
Sings your song slightly off-key and one day ahead. By spring, no one can tell you apart.
