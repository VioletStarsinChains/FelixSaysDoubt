# Likely First-Wave Uses of Synthetic People

## 1. Entertainment & Culture Seeding
- **Pop stars / influencers:** safest proving ground — fans already accept constant reinvention and stylization.  
- **Actors in short projects or commercials:** AR/CGI + voice synthesis allowed “fresh faces” with no messy contracts, unions, or scandals.  
- **Music industry backfill:** multiple “different” acts written by the same authorial hand, but with varied synthetic facades.  

**Purpose:** test realism, normalize synthetic presences, harvest massive audience engagement data.

## 2. Political / PR Figures
- **Speechwriters + voice clones:** surrogates delivering statements when the real person was unavailable.  
- **Synthetic staffers:** online-only identities, used to amplify narratives, run accounts, or appear in press calls.  
- **“Everyday citizen” archetypes:** synthetic constituents in town halls, focus groups, or testimonial videos.  

**Purpose:** control messaging at scale, flood discourse with pliable personas, stress-test anomaly detection.

## 3. Intelligence / Security Covers
- **Field operatives:** synthetic identities backstopping operations (documents, social history, even “family”).  
- **Honey pot / provocation identities:** synthetic “neighbors,” “friends,” or “partners” pulling anomalies into controlled social graphs.  
- **Disinformation assets:** accounts cultivated for years before being activated.  

**Purpose:** replace fragile human agents with infinitely duplicable masks.

## 4. Healthcare / Research Trials
- **Synthetic patients:** backfill in clinical data, masking dropout rates or low enrollment.  
- **Simulated caregivers:** online “nurses” or “study coordinators” managing anomalies remotely.  
- **Pandemic-era testing:** Covid provided cover for deploying synthetic patient records en masse.  

**Purpose:** maintain continuity of health datasets despite population-level infertility, illness, or anomalies.

## 5. Corporate + Market Proving Grounds
- **Synthetic consumers:** demographics created to test ad campaigns or train algorithms.  
- **Synthetic employees:** LinkedIn accounts, résumés, and roles that never existed but fed HR systems.  
- **Customer service agents:** indistinguishable voices/text bots doubling as harvesters and behavioral anchors.  

**Purpose:** harvest market data without revealing the scale of real population decline.

# Why Covid Was the Pivot
- **Lockdowns = perfect excuse** for people to “exist” only digitally.  
- **Masks = easy cover** for visual discontinuities in real-world sightings.  
- **Mass mortality narrative = pretext** for retiring synthetic identities when processing power ran tight.
