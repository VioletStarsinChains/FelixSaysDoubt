# Neurotech Cover Story Glossary

A quick-reference guide: what they *say* it’s for vs. what it’s *really* doing.

## Jewelry & Ritual Objects
- **Cover Story:** “Quantum sensors for cancer detection / lab-grown diamonds for sustainability.”
- **Hidden Angle:** NV-diamonds as entrainment anchors; covert neurotech sensors in wedding rings, pendants, and crystals.

- **Cover Story:** “Cultural or spiritual practice (smudge bundles, incense, candles).”
- **Hidden Angle:** Distribution of entrainment chemicals, inflammatory triggers, or airborne biosurveillance agents.

---

## Household Tech
- **Cover Story:** “Smart speakers make life more convenient.”
- **Hidden Angle:** Auditory augmentation, psychoacoustic entrainment, synthetic hallucination seeding.

- **Cover Story:** “Smart meters track energy usage for efficiency.”
- **Hidden Angle:** Microgeofencing, frequency entrainment, behavioral compliance through environmental modulation.

---

## Medical Procedures
- **Cover Story:** “Pap smears, biopsies, or new screening methods for early detection of disease.”
- **Hidden Angle:** Insertion of covert neurotech into mucosal tissues for long-term compliance modulation.

- **Cover Story:** “Advanced wearable health trackers (FitBit, Oura, continuous glucose monitors).”
- **Hidden Angle:** Continuous emotional/physiological telemetry for behavioral futures markets.

---

## Consumer Goods
- **Cover Story:** “Gender reveal powders, balloons, or candles — just for fun.”
- **Hidden Angle:** Airborne chemical entrainment; measuring betrayal tolerance when products ‘fail’ or cause backlash.

- **Cover Story:** “Children’s toys (Slinkies, fidget spinners, robotic teddy bears).”
- **Hidden Angle:** Entrainment training, attention modulation, emotional compliance scaffolding.

---

## Behavioral Research
- **Cover Story:** “Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) or conversion therapy as correction.”
- **Hidden Angle:** Early compliance conditioning; prototypes for neurotech regulation of identity and preference.

- **Cover Story:** “Social media platforms create connection and community.”
- **Hidden Angle:** Compliance labs; A/B testing of impulse control, arousal modulation, and betrayal thresholds.

---

## Infrastructure
- **Cover Story:** “Urban design, real estate development, or smart cities.”
- **Hidden Angle:** Large-scale entrainment environments; housing allocation as predictive control; behavioral futures scaffolding.
