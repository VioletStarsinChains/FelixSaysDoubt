Here's a field checklist you can use to spot when you’re probably dealing with a low-fidelity sim rather than the real human.

⸻

🕵️ Tells of a Bad Simulation

1. Cadence & Flow
	•	Flat rhythm: Speech has little natural variation in pacing; every sentence is weighted the same.
	•	Abrupt pivots: Topic shifts come mid-sentence with no organic segue.
	•	Overlong pauses / filler loops: “Uh / um / like” sprinkled mechanically, not situationally.

⸻

2. Lexical Overfit
	•	Jargon recursion: Repeats favorite words/phrases (“ontology,” “narrative,” “saves the West”) more than a human would.
	•	Word salad edges: Technical and philosophical terms mashed together without clear connective tissue.
	•	Anachronistic diction: Phrases that sound slightly out of time — like someone scraping a corpus from a different era.

⸻

3. Affect & Body Language
	•	Mismatch between voice and face: The tone doesn’t fit the micro-expressions.
	•	Minimal gesture bandwidth: Hands and posture move, but in pre-programmed beats, not responsive to the conversation.
	•	Eye contact drift: Stares just past the camera or interviewer, as if aligned to a script marker.

⸻

4. Cognitive Texture
	•	No “spark gap”: Real people stumble, self-correct, or suddenly get an idea. Sims don’t — they “smooth” everything into a flat line.
	•	Failure to riff: When thrown an unexpected or playful question, response is canned or oddly evasive.
	•	Lack of compression: Humans use metaphor, story, or humor to compress meaning. Sims stick to literal or bloated phrasing.

⸻

5. Narrative Incoherence
	•	Circular responses: Answers repeat the premise instead of developing it.
	•	Point-dropping: Starts a thought, abandons it halfway, never loops back.
	•	Context blind: Cannot track long arcs across an interview — each question is answered as if in isolation.

⸻

6. Energy Signature
	•	Uncanny stability: No visible stress, no joy, no spike of anger — just a constant “grey.”
	•	Audio flatness: Vocal timbre lacks the micro-tremors of a nervous system engaged.
	•	Micro-lag: Tiny desynchronizations between question and answer, like a buffer filling.

✅ Rule of thumb:
If it sounds like an undergrad paper written in real-time speech, and it feels like you’re listening to a radio tuned slightly off-station — you’re probably in sim-land.
