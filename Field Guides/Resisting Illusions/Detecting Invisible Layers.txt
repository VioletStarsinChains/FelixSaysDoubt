# üßµ Field Guide: Detecting Invisible Layers in Clothing & Textiles  

Smart textiles and selective-visibility garments can carry **hidden signals** that the wearer can‚Äôt see, but surveillance systems or other observers might. These layers may be digital (augmented reality), chemical (invisible inks/dyes), or structural (woven into the fabric).

## 1. **Lighting Tests**
- **UV light:** Shine a cheap UV flashlight on the garment. Many invisible inks fluoresce.  
- **Infrared photography:** Point an IR-sensitive camera (older camcorders, some phone filters removed) at the item; hidden text sometimes pops.  
- **Angle and sheen:** Rotate the fabric under direct light; faint symbols or differences in weave can appear.

## 2. **Digital Capture**
- **Smartphone camera filters:** Apps that allow raw capture in different channels (RGB separation, IR, or night mode) can reveal layers the eye misses.  
- **Polarized lenses:** Sunglasses with polarization can show subtle contrasts. Sometimes text ‚Äúghosts‚Äù appear that naked eyes gloss over.  
- **High-contrast editing:** Take a photo, crank up contrast/saturation. Hidden marks may suddenly appear.

## 3. **Tactile Clues**
- **Raised weave:** Run fingertips across logos or flat panels; sometimes invisible layers use different thread tension.  
- **Heat sensitivity:** Warm breath or a hairdryer may reveal thermo-reactive ink temporarily.  
- **Moisture test:** Lightly mist water ‚Äî hydrochromic prints can reveal themselves.

## 4. **Behavioral Clues**
- **Mismatch in reactions:** If strangers respond oddly to your clothing (smiling, staring, hostility), there may be signals you can‚Äôt see.  
- **Security sensors:** Retail scanners or airport gates may appear to react to the garment without clear cause.  
- **Mirror vs. photo:** If what you see in a mirror feels ‚Äúoff‚Äù compared to how people treat you, test with cameras.

## 5. **Red Flags for Deployment**
- **Online purchases from bulk resellers:** Items shipped via warehousing hubs (e.g., Katy, TX) may be modified or contain synthetic layers.  
- **Unlabeled promotional apparel:** Free shirts/hats given out at events sometimes double as behavioral probes.  
- **Recycled fabrics:** Surplus textiles may be printed with invisible codes before entering consumer markets.

## 6. **What to Do if You Suspect Hidden Layers**
- **Document:** Photograph under multiple conditions and lighting.  
- **Rotate context:** Wear the same garment in different settings; note changes in others‚Äô behavior.  
- **Layer shield:** A light jacket or second shirt can block many of these visual cues.  
- **Archive safely:** If evidence is found, seal the garment in a bag to prevent further tampering.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Insight
The goal of these garments isn‚Äôt fashion ‚Äî it‚Äôs **asymmetric perception**. If you don‚Äôt know what signals you‚Äôre giving off, but others (or systems) do, your behavior becomes more predictable and more profitable in **behavioral futures markets**.
