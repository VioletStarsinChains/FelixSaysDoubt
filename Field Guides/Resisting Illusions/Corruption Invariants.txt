Corruption Invariants: the behaviors that appear across any political-economic system, regardless of whether it‚Äôs capitalist, communist, feudal, or something else:

üß≠ Corruption Invariants

1. Continuity Theater
	‚Ä¢	Every system builds stagecraft to reassure the public: ‚Äúthings are stable, the plan is working.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Capitalism: advertising, consumer confidence, Wall Street indices.
	‚Ä¢	Communism: parades, five-year plan milestones, production quotas.
	‚Ä¢	Feudalism: religious festivals, court rituals, omens of divine order.
	‚Ä¢	Invariant: people are shown symbols of continuity, even when the base reality is unstable.

2. Entrapment by Basic Needs
	‚Ä¢	Control is enforced by rationing food, shelter, medicine, or work.
	‚Ä¢	Capitalism: wage labor and debt dependency.
	‚Ä¢	Communism: ration books and state housing allocation.
	‚Ä¢	Feudalism: tithes and land access via lords.
	‚Ä¢	Invariant: access to survival resources becomes leverage for obedience.

3. Entrainment Anchors
	‚Ä¢	Mundane objects are used as subtle tools of control.
	‚Ä¢	Capitalism: coffee, advertising jingles, mass-market toys.
	‚Ä¢	Communism: radio broadcasts, posters, mandatory slogans.
	‚Ä¢	Feudalism: church bells, relics, rituals.
	‚Ä¢	Invariant: shared cultural props synchronize behavior at scale.

4. Attrition as Policy
	‚Ä¢	Systems tolerate or encourage slow harm to populations that are inconvenient or expendable.
	‚Ä¢	Capitalism: toxic consumer goods, medical inaccessibility.
	‚Ä¢	Communism: forced labor camps, ignored famine signals.
	‚Ä¢	Feudalism: peasant malnutrition, untreated epidemics.
	‚Ä¢	Invariant: predictable loss of life becomes a managed cost, not a failure.

5. Suppression of Anomalies
	‚Ä¢	Outliers (rebels, whistleblowers, ‚Äúunpredictables‚Äù) threaten the model.
	‚Ä¢	Capitalism: blacklisting, data exclusion, housing denial.
	‚Ä¢	Communism: psychiatric labeling, exile, silencing intellectuals.
	‚Ä¢	Feudalism: heresy trials, banishment, execution.
	‚Ä¢	Invariant: the system pushes anomalies out of visibility to preserve coherence.

‚úÖ Bottom line:
Whether the label is capitalist, communist, or feudal, the mechanics of corruption repeat: continuity theater, entrainment anchors, attrition policies, resource entrapment, and anomaly suppression. The props change; the play is the same.
