# TNG “Remember Me” — Attrition Simulation & Behavioral Modeling Lens

**Premise (one line):** Dr. Crusher is trapped in a warp-bubble pocket reality where the **population shrinks step-by-step** and the environment **rewrites the rules** to insist that nothing’s wrong. It’s a textbook synthetic attrition chamber.

---

## What the “experiment” looks like
- **Synthetic environment:** The warp bubble is a sealed testbed that can **add/remove entities** and **rewrite definitions** (computer, logs, even other people’s memories) in real time.
- **Operators:** Wesley (unwitting) + the Traveler (expert) function like **external controllers**, tuning the boundary and trying to reopen a path—analogous to contractors adjusting parameters on a live simulation.
- **Protocol:** Iterative **population removal** (friends → crew → entire Starfleet), each step testing Crusher’s **sense-making**, **escalation paths**, and **resilience** under isolation.

---

## Behavioral modeling moves on display
- **Progressive attrition:** Fewer bodies, fewer witnesses, fewer anchors. Measures **time-to-panic vs time-to-hypothesis** at each loss threshold.
- **Narrative trap calibration:** The computer **redefines normal** after each disappearance (“There have only ever been X crew”). This tests whether the subject accepts **administrative reality edits**.
- **Authority compliance test:** Crusher appeals to Picard/Data/computer, but authority either **mirrors the new narrative** or shrinks away. Tracks **when she stops deferring** and self-authorizes action.
- **Schema erosion:** Social proof collapses; memory confidence is attacked. Classic **gaslight mechanics** for modeling when a subject doubts perception vs. doubles down on evidence.
- **Observer effect:** As Crusher **recognizes the pattern** (“If there’s nothing wrong with me, maybe there’s something wrong with the universe”), her behavior stabilizes around investigation—not panic—producing **lower-volatility signal**.
- **Environmental gating:** The bubble literally **contracts the navigable map** (the corridor/walls closing in), forcing moves along designer-chosen paths—useful for **pathfinding and problem-solving telemetry**.

---

## What they’d be measuring (if this were a live study)
- **Thresholds:** How many losses until the subject rejects institutional narratives? (friend → crew → universe)
- **Search policy:** Does she run to authority, to data, to experiments? In what order? (Crusher: authority → logs → controlled tests → holistic hypothesis)
- **Cognitive style under stress:** Hypothesis updates, error-checking, willingness to entertain “impossible” models.
- **Trust reallocation:** When the computer normalizes contradictions, does trust **shift inward** (self, first principles) or outward (remaining authorities)?
- **Resilience index:** Maintains clinical method even when universe = 1 person. Very high.

---

## Why it maps to behavioral futures markets
- **Population-thinning scenarios** → proxy for **collapse forecasting** (what happens as networks vanish: friends, services, supply chains).
- **Administrative reality editing** → mirrors **record erasure / dashboard “truth”** (if the system says there was never a shortage, never a person, do you comply?).
- **Live parameter tuning** → like contractors iterating **narratives, outages, or access blocks** to see where subjects break or adapt.

---

## Compliance anchors vs. anomaly behavior
- The simulation tries **anchors** (computer certainty, Captain’s reassurance, ship’s “normal ops”).  
- Crusher acts like an **anomaly subject**: acknowledges fear, but **won’t convert to compliance** without reconciling evidence. She becomes *unmodelable for panic*, rich for **methodical problem-solving telemetry**.

---

## Escape mechanics = counter-modeling
- **Recognition + alignment:** Wesley/Traveler open an aperture; Crusher must **self-locate** and move decisively.  
- Metaphorically: awareness + a stable external reference is the only exit from **narrative traps**.

---

## Field guide: spotting “Remember Me” patterns IRL
- **Stepwise attrition:** People/resources “disappear,” and each time the **system insists it was always smaller**.
- **Self-editing logs:** Dashboards/policies retroactively match the new normal (no audit trail).
- **Authority shrinkage:** Fewer reachable humans; the remaining ones echo policy, not facts.
- **Map contraction:** Fewer options/routes; the **environment nudges** you toward preselected corridors.
- **Key defense:** Name the contradiction, test it, **trust your evidence**, and keep a personal log outside the system.
