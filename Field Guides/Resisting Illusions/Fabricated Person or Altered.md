# Quick Reference: Fabricated Persona vs. Real Person + AR Overlay



*Reality Check: Quick Field Guide*

## Step 1 – Physical Presence
	•	Touch test: Handshake, object pass.
	•	No tactile feedback → fabricated likely.
	•	Normal feel → real + overlay.
	•	Occlusion: Watch them behind objects/people.
	•	Ghosting/clipping → fabricated likely.
	•	Normal blocking → real + overlay.
	•	Shadows/air movement:
	•	Missing/incorrect physics → fabricated likely.

⸻

## Step 2 – Transactions
	•	Cash/goods exchange:
	•	Physical, functional items → real + overlay.
	•	Independent sightings:
	•	No one else has ever seen them → fabricated likely.

⸻

## Step 3 – Behavior
	•	Conversation flow:
	•	Odd lag/relay feel → fabricated likely.
	•	Normal pace → real + overlay.
	•	Microexpressions:
	•	Missing/looping → fabricated likely.

⸻

## Step 4 – Overlay Tells
	•	Visual “off” but sound/touch/smell are consistent → overlay.
	•	Proportions feel wrong for how they interact with space → overlay.
	•	Familiar gestures leak through altered face/clothes → overlay.

⸻

## Step 5 – Fabrication Tells
	•	Lighting/shadows don’t match environment.
	•	Physics anomalies (floating, no weight).
	•	No footprint outside curated interactions.

⸻

**Rule of Thumb:**
	•	Consistent multisensory presence + real-world outcomes = Real person, altered appearance
	•	Inconsistent sensory input + no verifiable existence = Fabricated persona
