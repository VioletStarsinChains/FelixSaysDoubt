# 🎨 Field Guide to Colors as Entrainment Codes
*Think of colors as QR codes for your brain — visual signals that quietly align mood, memory, and behavior.*

## 🧩 How It Works
Colors combine like QR modules.  
- A **blue + white palette** = trust + reset → hospitals, tech UIs.  
- **Red + yellow + black** = urgency + alert + authority → hazard signs, fast food.  
- Patterns aren’t accidental — they’re **visual entrainment codes.**

⚖️ **Rule of Thumb:**  
If a color scheme feels *too consistent* across industries or environments, it’s not fashion — it’s a **QR code for your brain.**
