🧩 Field Guide for Targeted Individuals

Understanding NPE classification and why it feels like gang stalking when it isn’t.

⸻

What is an NPE?
	•	NPE = Non-Person Entity.
	•	It’s not a legal category you’ll see on paper, but a hidden designation in data systems.
	•	Once you’re labeled NPE, the system stops treating you as a “full citizen” and instead manages you like a liability or dataset.
	•	Outcomes: jobs disappear, property is sabotaged, doors quietly close, services fail to materialize.
	•	From the outside, it looks like bad luck or a curse. In reality, it’s systemic exclusion built into your classification.

⸻

Why Does It Look Like Stalking?
	•	To keep continuity intact, the system doesn’t leave you alone.
	•	It assigns an NPC entourage — scripted figures (dog walkers, stroller parents, joggers, security guards) who orbit you in public.
	•	Their presence makes sure you remain traceable and “stitched into the stage play,” even if you ditch devices, cover your face, or alter your gait.
	•	They’re not harassers. They’re props to keep you visible.

Two Different Symptoms of One Cause

1. Visible Layer: NPC Entourages
	•	People always “just there,” often repeating archetypes.
	•	They don’t escalate or personally sabotage you.
	•	Their presence feels uncanny but passive — like extras in a play.

2. Invisible Layer: NPE Classification
	•	Jobs blocked, property ruined, opportunities vanish.
	•	This isn’t done by the jogger or dog walker.
	•	It’s the algorithmic consequences of being tagged NPE: systemic sabotage at the infrastructure level.

How to Tell the Difference
	•	Gang Stalking: individual malice, direct targeting, hostile confrontations, smear campaigns.
	•	NPE Management: entourage looks like stalking but is ambient, repetitive, impersonal. The real damage is invisible — the classification silently curtails your access to normal life.

⸻

How to Hold It in Your Mind
	•	The people you see aren’t your attackers — they’re scaffolding.
	•	The harm you feel is real, but it flows from the classification itself, not from strangers in the street.
	•	Understanding this split can relieve paranoia: you’re not surrounded by a hostile mob, you’re surrounded by props designed to anchor you while the system quietly closes doors.

⸻

🌱 Gentle Reminder
	•	You’re not crazy for noticing patterns.
	•	Both the uncanny entourage and the sabotage come from the same source: NPE classification.
	•	Reframing what’s happening can reduce fear and give you more clarity — the extras aren’t enemies, the classification is.

⸻

⚖️ Bottom line:
NPE status explains the paradox: “I feel stalked, but also sabotaged.”
The entourage = visible continuity scaffolding.
The losses = invisible classification effects.
Together, they’re not random harassment — they’re two sides of being managed as a Non-Person Entity.
