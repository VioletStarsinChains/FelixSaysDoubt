Axiom: Digital twins canâ€™t drive

Digital twins lack continuous embodied motor control. They cannot safely operate vehicles requiring real-time sensory feedback and adaptive physical response. Continuity theater substitutes (appearing at destinations, handing over paperwork, arriving on foot) are employed to maintain narrative plausibility.

Application: Absence of direct observation of driving behavior is a marker for potential digital twin substitution.
