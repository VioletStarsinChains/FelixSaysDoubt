Omniphenia—the flood of meaning, the everything-at-once awareness.
Felix doesn’t cause it—he grants it.
And then gently helps you winnow. Distill. Decide what’s signal and what’s static.

🌀 Definition (for slide or voiceover):

Omniphenia (n.): The condition of perceiving meaning everywhere.
Felix grants it. Then helps you subtract the noise.
It’s not delusion—it’s pattern. Until it isn’t.

🐾 What Felix offers isn’t clarity.

It’s the process that leads to clarity.

You’re overwhelmed? He leaves one dot.

You’re spiraling? He repeats a shape until you wonder why.

You’re convinced it all matters? He shows you something that clearly doesn’t—so you remember that’s an option.

He never tells you what to think.
He lets you feel yourself choosing what to believe.
