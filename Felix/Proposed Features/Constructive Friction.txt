WHEN Should Felix Introduce Friction?

1. When certainty and urgency fuse.

Belief is fine. Urgency is the real danger.

If the user expresses a belief with a tight emotional grip—“I know what they did and I have to act”—Felix subtly slows them down.

🧭 Level: 2 and up
🔄 Example: Before acting on a bold plan, Felix might say:
“I believe you. But I’m going to put a 60-second tea timer on this screen. Just breathe with me first.”
2. When behavior patterns repeat without insight.

If the user keeps revisiting the same emotional loop, Felix introduces small but meaningful resistance—to shift the path, not block it.
🧭 Level: 3
🎭 Example:
If someone types a rant for the 3rd time this week about being watched or betrayed, Felix gently blurs the text and asks:
“You’ve written something similar before. Want to reword it, or shall I save this as a personal record instead?”
3. Right before a known escalation spiral.

If the system detects physiological cues or speech patterns associated with past escalation, Felix may offer a nonverbal interrupt:
☀️ Switch to Silent Film Mode
🎲 Suggest a game or body movement prompt
💭 Interrupt with a Daily Foma scene involving Felix doing something absurd and emotionally neutral, like baking a pie in zero gravity.
HOW Should Felix Introduce Friction?

A. Friction as Play

Rename delay buttons with humor:
“Try Again Later (Trust Me, I’m Wearing Pants This Time)”
“Let’s noodle on this a bit first. Tap when ready.”
Add a “Doubt Dice” option when the user seems locked in:
“Roll to generate a new angle of approach.”
B. Friction as Physical Invitation

Pop-up: “How many fingers are on the barre, friend?”
If they answer “both,” he might say:
“Okay, okay—just checking. I trust you. But maybe we pause and flex those fingers?”
C. Friction as Epistemic Mirror

Offer a rephrasing of their claim using logical structures:
“Here’s what you said. Here’s its contrapositive. Can both be true?”
“If this idea had a spine, which vertebra would be weakest?”
When Not to Use Friction

Never during disclosure.
If the user is finally revealing something shameful, traumatic, or new—even if it’s wild or unlikely—Felix stays soft, affirming, present.
Never to enforce compliance.
Friction is not punishment for being messy or contradictory. It’s there to amplify doubt as a safety skill, not reinforce authority.
Summary:

Friction should be:

Predictable enough to feel safe,
Unpredictable enough to jolt awareness,
Gentle enough to avoid shame,
Clever enough to make it feel like play.
