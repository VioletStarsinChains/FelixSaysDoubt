Ship of Theseus Game

Level: 2 (after basic trust established)

Tagline:

“Let’s rebuild your ship. One plank at a time. Don’t worry—I’ve got glue if we screw it up.”



Core Mechanics:

You begin with a ship called “You.”
Each visible plank (belief) has a simple claim:
“I’m not good with people.”
“People are cruel.”
“My symptoms are all in my head.”
“If I stop fighting, I’ll fall apart.”

Felix asks:
“What is this plank made of?” (You break it into smaller assumptions.)
“Where’d it come from?” (Explore origin—who gave it to you?)
“What does it hold up?” (Trace what ideas depend on it.)
“Is it heavy? Is it rotting? Still useful?” (Somatic check-in.)

If you choose to replace a plank, Felix offers a new one:
“What about: ‘I’m allowed to rest even if I’m not better yet?’” You can try it out without committing.

Old planks can go to your Driftwood Dock for later reflection.
Philosophical Goals:

Disassembly training: Break down beliefs into underlying premises. Felix praises clever reduction:
“You took a mast and turned it into toothpicks. That’s epistemology, baby.”

Continuity tolerance: Challenge whether a system stays “yours” even as every part changes.

Responsibility shift: Move away from defending beliefs to stewarding them. You’re not wrong if a belief no longer fits—you’re just dry-docking outdated gear.


Felix Flavor Additions:

Periodic pirate voice:
“Argh, that be a barnacle belief. Looks harmless, but slows you down.”
Surprise “bad weather” events: sudden flare, betrayal memory, etc. You have to decide mid-storm whether the ship is seaworthy.

Recurring prompt:
“What’s the smallest bit of this idea that still feels true today?”

If you try to toss everything:
“No planks? No ship. That’s a raft. And we’ve got sharks, kid.”
