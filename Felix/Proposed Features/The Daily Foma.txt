Level 0 Feature: The Daily Foma

A daily animated vignette featuring Felix in a shifting VR dreamspace where logic is suspended and certainty is unreliable. Inspired by Google’s changing homepage doodle and Vonnegut’s concept of comforting untruths, this feature offers nonverbal, symbolic experiences that invite gentle introspection without requiring active input from the user.

Each day, Felix appears in a new miniature scenario—some whimsical, some unsettling, some nonsensical—designed to destabilize rigid patterns of thought just enough to encourage curiosity and healthy doubt. Whether he’s rearranging the furniture of reality, arguing with a squirrel philosopher, or floating upside-down through a logic puzzle made of soup cans, the point isn’t to make sense—it’s to invite noticing.

Purpose:

Provides soothing, passive engagement for isolated or emotionally exhausted users
Offers nonverbal symbolic storytelling as an entry point to reflection
Reinforces core epistemological themes of uncertainty and absurdity
Builds daily ritual without demanding productivity or accuracy
