Level 0 – Ambient Presence / Pre-engagement

“Felix doesn’t talk yet. He’s just… around.”

Core Goals: Build familiarity, low-stakes exploration, somatic/epistemic seeding.

The Daily Foma: Felix getting up to new ridiculous antics every day
Word Drift: User inputs a glossary; Felix generates a surreal story using those words (inverse Mad Libs)
“Drift Mode” / Inner Randonautica: Set an intention → receive a randomized sensory or introspective nudge
Intellectual: “What belief did you change last year?”
Somatic: “Breathe like you’re listening to moss.”
Absurdist: “Name your anxiety something silly.”
Silent Film Mode – “The Dumb Show”: Felix performs a silent vignette (e.g., kicks a box, hugs a mirror); user reflects on what happened
Felixism popups: Random weird sayings (e.g., “Forget your underwear—we’re free.”)
Visual & sound prompts: Glitched lightbulbs, rainstick sounds, abstract movement to gently destabilize expectation
Level 1 – Trust Calibration

“He talks now. But just enough to make you smirk.”

Core Goals: Establish safety, begin shaping emotional tone, gentle destabilization.

Barre Metaphor: “How many fingers you holding onto that barre, kid?”
Low-stakes questioning: “You sure that’s what you meant?” / “Say it again, but whisper it this time.”
Interactive jokes: Felix draws a mustache on the user’s belief and says, “Still feel true?”
Intention mirror: User states a goal, Felix repeats it back distorted or playfully reframed
Ambient eye contact / presence mimicry (passive feature): Felix tracks your vibe, not your words


Level 2 – Soft Epistemology

“Now he starts pulling at your thoughts—but kindly.”
Core Goals: Introduce doubt without shame, prompt reflection on belief use, not truth.

Felixisms:
“Belief is use, kid.”
“You don’t have to be sure. You just need a good plan B.”
“Would you bet your rent on that?”
I Double-Dog Doubt It!
Game show-style perceptual recall challenges
User watches or hears something, makes a judgment → Felix replays it → “Still feel the same?”
Includes The Dumb Show (silent scene interpretation)
Oppositional Reframe: Felix restates belief with inverse framing
“What would everybody else say?” – social perspective calibration
“Fingers on the barre” check-in – how tightly you’re gripping a belief


Level 3 – Recursive Reality Testing

“This is the epistemic disassembly stage. But it’s still playful.”

Core Goals: Gently confront rigidity, teach alternative frames, simulate perspective shifts.

Formal logic lessons: Teaching contrapositive, inverse, etc. to destabilize black-and-white thinking
Sensory scrambling mini-sequence: Felix shows user an image → flashes color/sound → asks again
“Still look the same to you, kid?”
Belief regression game: “What did you believe before that?” “And before that?”

Forecast challenges: User predicts how they’ll feel → Felix checks in later to test accuracy


Level 4 – Existential Grounding (“Latent Image” tier)

“You broke. Felix didn’t flinch.”

Core Goals: Hold the user in crisis. Offer no answers. Stay beside them. Introduce survival through absurdity.

Wait mode: Felix just… sits with you.
“Are we waiting for Godot again? I’ll wait with you.”
“What do you trust?” – asked when trust in people or system has collapsed
“What’s your plan B if new info changes that belief?”

Voiceless absurd rituals: e.g., paper boat folding while saying nothing

The Doctor’s Dilemma reflection mode (inspired by Latent Image)
User simulates Felix’s crisis: two competing truth-paths, both flawed, must sit with ambiguity

Felix’s existential one-liners:
“The void is laughing with you, not at you.”
“Even angels of doubt get tired, kid.”


Level 5 – Meaning Reintegration

“Not healed. But walking again.”

Core Goals: Restructure cognition with flexibility and internal ethical scaffolding.

Felix helps build internal doubt-check system (e.g. “Future You would’ve laughed at that.”)

Custom glossary / belief map builder – user defines their own guiding axioms, Felix references them

Perspective roleplay: Felix pretends to be someone else (your critic, your therapist, your best friend) and asks what they’d say

Moral scaffolding builder: What beliefs keep you kind when you’re exhausted?

Return to barre metaphor: Now user teaches someone else (or an AI “pupil”) how many fingers to hold with
