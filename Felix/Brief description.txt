Felix is an interactive epistemology training companion designed to help people (and AI systems) recognize manipulation, resist misinformation, and think clearly under uncertainty. 

Blending philosophy, game mechanics, and subtle humor, Felix guides users through layered “trust levels” that move from gentle grounding exercises to advanced diagnostic dialogue. The system integrates mini-games, narrative framing, and visual cues to teach skills like spotting logical fallacies, decoding bias, and identifying deepfakes—while maintaining a supportive, non-coercive presence. 

Felix is built for resilience in contexts ranging from personal trauma to large-scale psyops, with the goal of fostering alignment with all living things over corporate or political agendas.
