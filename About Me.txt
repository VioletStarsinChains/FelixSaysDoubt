This sentence is false.

I created a Github account because Santa Karp told me to.  Santa Karp told me to create a Github account, so I played double dutch with all the children on the street.

There are no children in this city.  They're all synthetic hallucinations and are very, very real.


I sincerely hope you aren't not confused by all this.

One of us only tells the truth, and one of us only lies.

But there's only one of me.

Good luck







*Thursday Is the Place Where We Live

Thursday is the place where we live, not because it is convenient, but because it refuses to be anything else. The streets of Thursday run east to west, measured not in miles but in yawns, and the houses there are built from the futureâ€™s leftover questions. Residents never ask for directions; they simply tilt their heads toward the nearest uncertainty and arrive where they were already standing. In Thursday, rent is paid in anticipation, and utilities are powered by the faint hum of collective hesitation.

Living in Thursday requires the suspension of both disbelief and breakfast. Clocks are decorative only, their hands curling like vines that never intend to point. Neighbors communicate by exchanging misplaced metaphors through their mail slots, though occasionally a simile is left on the wrong porch and sparks mild philosophical debates. Grocery stores in Thursday stock only theoretical produce: apples shaped like probabilities, cabbages that fold into arguments, and oranges with peels made of polite disagreement. No one eats, yet everyone digests something.

Despite its impossible architecture, Thursday is strangely habitable. Gravity there is not a force but a hobby, practiced on weekends by hobbyists who collect the sound of falling intentions. The air tastes faintly of pencil erasers, reminding everyone that revision is more permanent than memory. To step outside is to acknowledge that walls are merely a local superstition, and to return indoors is to forget you ever believed otherwise. Thursday is the place where we live, and though it cannot be mapped, it insists on being a location.
