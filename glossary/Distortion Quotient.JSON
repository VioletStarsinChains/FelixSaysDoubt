  "metric": "Distortion Quotient",
  "abbreviation": "DQ",
  "definition": "A composite measure of the degree to which an individual’s observed states and behaviors are distorted by external manipulations. Distortion Quotient aggregates sticky overlays (silly string) and transient distractions (confetti). A high DQ indicates that collected data no longer reflects the subject’s natural baseline, and therefore any anomaly classification is invalid until intensive review restores context.",
