Confetti (glossary term)

Definition:
A metaphor for manipulations that come as brief, colorful bursts of distraction. Where silly string sticks to a person and gets mistaken for part of who they are, confetti scatters across their awareness and then disappears. Its purpose isn’t to cling — it’s to fragment attention, flood perception, and make it harder to focus on what’s important.

⸻

Domains of Application:
	•	Narrative distraction: rapid-fire news, breadcrumb overload, irrelevant prompts that scatter attention.
	•	Cognitive fragmentation: push alerts, ads, micro-prompts — anything that splinters working memory.
	•	Sensorial overload: flashing lights, sudden sounds, or bright visuals that spike arousal and then vanish.
	•	Data pollution: irrelevant, “colorful” inputs seeded into datasets to mask real anomalies.
	•	Social chaff: chatter, engineered interactions, or staged drama that clogs bandwidth.

⸻

Key Properties:
	•	Ephemeral: bursts fade quickly.
	•	Non-sticky: they don’t cling to baseline identity.
	•	Fragmentary: they split attention into small, shallow pieces.
	•	Cumulative noise: many bursts add up to a fog of distraction.
	•	Masking: they cover over deeper manipulations (like silly string overlays) running at the same time.

Forensic Tagging:
	•	Tag: “Confetti – External Entrainment Distraction”
	•	Cross-reference: Silly String overlays, Cold Entrainment, Narrative Breadcrumbing, Behavioral Futures noise.
