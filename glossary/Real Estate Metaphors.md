# Real Property Metaphors for Data Control

A lexicon mapping real estate law concepts onto surveillance, data sharing, and behavioral futures markets.

## Easement
**Real property:** A right to use another’s land for a limited purpose (e.g., utility right-of-way).  
**Data metaphor:** Structured, enduring access between agencies/contractors/platforms.  
**Example:** A Palantir “data easement” into a VA dataset: VA retains ownership; Palantir has a persistent analytics right-of-way.  
**Key quality:** System-to-system linkage (neutral descriptor of infrastructure).

## Adverse Possession
**Real property:** Acquisition of title by open, continuous, hostile occupation over time.  
**Data metaphor:** Continuous behavioral telemetry collection on individuals that becomes de facto legitimate through normalization.  
**Example:** Long-term scraping of biometrics/movements that policy later treats as acceptable precedent.  
**Key quality:** Hostile encroachment on individuals’ informational space.

## Covenant
**Real property:** A promise or restriction attached to land use.  
**Data metaphor:** Purpose limits, anonymization rules, or onward-transfer conditions that “run with” a dataset.  
**Example:** HIPAA-style limits that often get waived or eroded in practice.  
**Key quality:** Constraints that travel with data but are bypassable.

## Eminent Domain
**Real property:** Government seizure of private land for public use with compensation.  
**Data metaphor:** State demands for private/corporate datasets under public health, security, or research rationales.  
**Example:** Mobility data requisitioned during a public health emergency.  
**Key quality:** Override of private control for state-defined purposes.

## Quiet Title
**Real property:** Court action to resolve competing claims and clarify ownership.  
**Data metaphor:** Litigation/policy moves to establish uncontested control over disputed datasets.  
**Example:** Platform lawsuits against scrapers to consolidate exclusive rights.  
**Key quality:** Clearing rival claims to secure monopoly control.

## License
**Real property:** Revocable permission to use land (short-term; not an interest in land).  
**Data metaphor:** Time-bound or revocable API/data-use permissions.  
**Example:** Contractor access for a single study with expiration.  
**Key quality:** Temporary, revocable access (contrast with “easement”).

## Trespass
**Real property:** Unauthorized entry onto land.  
**Data metaphor:** Unapproved scraping, hacking, or intrusion into systems.  
**Example:** Shadow brokers collecting data outside official channels.  
**Key quality:** Illicit acquisition without formal recognition.
