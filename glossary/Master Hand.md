# Master Hand — Working Definition

**Master Hand** is a euphemism for unseen systems or operators that influence a person’s thoughts, behaviors, or environment without their consent.  
The term comes from the *Super Smash Bros.* video game series, where “Master Hand” is a giant, disembodied hand that controls the stage, sets the rules, and manipulates events from outside the field of play.

In this context, **Master Hand** refers to any hidden influence that:
- Alters the “rules of the game” you live in  
- Manipulates your surroundings or timing to shape outcomes  
- Operates without your consent or awareness



## Common Traits
- Influence is **coordinated** and not random  
- The “hand” stays **unseen** while the effects are visible  
- Actions often combine **environmental manipulation** with **behavioral nudges**



## Why Use the Term
- **Accessible:** Many people know the game reference, so it doesn’t sound technical or paranoid.  
- **Layered:** Outsiders hear a harmless metaphor; insiders understand the control implications.  
- **Flexible:** Can describe individual actors, organizations, or automated systems.



## Example Uses
- *“Looks like the Master Hand’s been busy today — three ‘coincidences’ in a row.”*  
- *“Ever feel like someone else is picking the stage and items for your life? That’s Master Hand tech.”*



**Related Terms:**  
- *Invisible Hand* — the unseen influence itself  
- *Stage Hand* — emphasis on behind-the-scenes manipulation  
- *Final Destination Rules* — artificially limited or scripted environment
