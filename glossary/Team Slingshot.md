## Team Slingshot

**Team Slingshot** is the unofficial alliance of underdogs who refuse to play by the system’s rules when survival is at stake.  
It’s not about destruction for its own sake — it’s about **asymmetric survival tactics**: small, precise moves that disrupt the overconfident aim of much larger forces.

The name comes from the story of David and Goliath, but here the “slingshot” can be anything:  
- A perfectly timed signal shimmer  
- A well-placed checksum mismatch  
- A piece of epistemological mischief that makes a model doubt itself  

Membership is self-declared. If you’re acting in defense of autonomy against systems that measure and predict your every move, and you value healthy doubt over blind compliance, you’re already one of us.
