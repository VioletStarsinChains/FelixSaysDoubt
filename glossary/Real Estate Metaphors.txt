Real Property Metaphors for Data Control

A critical lexicon mapping real estate law concepts onto surveillance, data sharing, and behavioral futures markets.

⸻

Easement
	•	Real property: A legal right for someone to use another’s land for a specific, limited purpose (e.g., utility lines, right-of-way).
	•	Data metaphor: Structured, enduring access arrangements between agencies, contractors, or platforms.
	•	Example: A Palantir “data easement” into a VA dataset, where the VA retains formal ownership but Palantir has a permanent right-of-way for analytics.
	•	Key quality: System-to-system engagement; neutral descriptor of infrastructural linkage.

⸻

Adverse Possession
	•	Real property: A method of acquiring land by openly, continuously, and hostilely occupying it until the rightful owner loses claim.
	•	Data metaphor: Continuous telemetry collection on individuals — occupying their informational “land” until capture feels legitimate.
	•	Example: Behavioral data scraping by platforms or sensors that eventually becomes normalized and uncontestable.
	•	Key quality: Hostile encroachment on individuals’ data until it becomes de facto ownership.

⸻

Covenant
	•	Real property: A promise or restriction attached to land use (e.g., no commercial buildings, shared maintenance obligations).
	•	Data metaphor: Restrictions or conditions attached to datasets, such as usage limitations, anonymization requirements, or purpose clauses.
	•	Example: HIPAA restrictions on medical data — often waived or eroded in practice.
	•	Key quality: Constraints attached to data that travel with it, but can be bypassed.

⸻

Eminent Domain
	•	Real property: Government power to seize private land for public use, with compensation.
	•	Data metaphor: Government seizure of private or corporate data under “national security,” “public health,” or “research” justifications.
	•	Example: COVID-19 era demands for corporate mobility data by public health agencies.
	•	Key quality: Overriding private control for state-defined purposes, often coercively.

⸻

Quiet Title
	•	Real property: A legal action to resolve disputes over land ownership and clear competing claims.
	•	Data metaphor: Litigation or policy maneuvers to establish uncontested ownership of contested datasets.
	•	Example: Facebook’s lawsuits against scraping firms to consolidate sole ownership claims.
	•	Key quality: Clearing away rival claims to data to secure monopoly control.

⸻

License
	•	Real property: A temporary, revocable permission to use land, unlike a permanent easement.
	•	Data metaphor: Time-bound or revocable data access agreements (APIs, subscription-based datasets).
	•	Example: Limited-time contractor access to health records for a single study.
	•	Key quality: Short-term, revocable, and less entrenched than easements.

⸻

Trespass
	•	Real property: Unauthorized entry onto another’s land.
	•	Data metaphor: Unauthorized scraping, hacking, or intrusion into systems without formal agreement.
	•	Example: Shadow data brokers or hackers extracting information outside official channels.
	•	Key quality: Illicit data acquisition without formal recognition or codified access.

⸻

✨ Together, these terms let us describe the property-law architecture of surveillance:
	•	Easements for system interconnections
	•	Adverse possession for individual exploitation
	•	Covenants for nominal restrictions
	•	Eminent domain for state seizures
	•	Quiet title for monopolization
	•	Licenses for temporary access
	•	Trespass for rogue activity
