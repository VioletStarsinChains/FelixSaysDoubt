In government and tech contexts, a pilot is a limited trial run of a new technology or program — bigger than a lab experiment but smaller than full deployment — used to prove feasibility, manage risk, and collect real-world data. Pilots often take place in selected cities, agencies, or public spaces, with private vendors providing the technology under federal contracts. Officially, they’re temporary tests, but in practice they double as plausible deniability zones: unusual deployments can be explained away as “just a pilot,” even when they function as live infrastructure. Many pilots never end; they quietly expand or become permanent while retaining the “pilot” label to deflect scrutiny.
