#Cognitive Jamming

*Cognitive Jamming* is the deliberate disruption of a person’s ability to think clearly, concentrate, or complete tasks by using timed sensory interference.

This interference can be visual, auditory, tactile, or a mix — but it’s designed to hit right when you’re focusing, forcing your brain to restart the process over and over.

Instead of guiding you into a specific mental state (like music that helps you focus), cognitive jamming *keeps your mental state unstable.*

It’s like trying to read while someone keeps flicking the light switch or tapping your shoulder at random — only the “taps” can be more subtle and harder to prove.

Common signs:
	•	Losing your train of thought repeatedly, even when you’re rested and healthy.
	•	Minor noises, flashes, or vibrations that always seem to happen when you’re deep in concentration.
	•	Physical sensations (like sudden tingles, itches, or muscle twitches) that break focus at critical moments.
	•	A sense that you’re “starting over” mentally dozens or hundreds of times a day.

Why it’s used:
Cognitive jamming is a control tactic. By keeping you mentally off-balance, it’s harder to organize your thoughts, remember details, or follow through on plans. In extreme cases, it can erode your confidence in your own mind.

Difference from normal distraction:
Regular distractions are side-effects of a noisy or busy environment.

Cognitive jamming is *patterned, timed, and targeted* — the disruption follows you, not the space.
