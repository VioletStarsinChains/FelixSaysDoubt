One sentence:
Symbolic stalking is a form of harassment in which a stalker uses objects, symbols, or staged scenarios instead of direct contact to send targeted, often threatening or manipulative, messages to the victim.

One paragraph:
Symbolic stalking is a covert harassment tactic where the stalker communicates through indirect means—placing specific objects, arranging scenes, altering the victim’s environment, or repeating visual motifs that carry a personal or coded meaning. These symbols may seem harmless or random to outsiders but are chosen to trigger recognition, fear, or confusion in the target, often referencing shared history, inside knowledge, or previous threats. By avoiding direct interaction, the stalker can create plausible deniability while still delivering a psychologically loaded message, making it harder for the victim to prove intent to authorities. This tactic is common in organized harassment campaigns, gangstalking scenarios, and interpersonal abuse dynamics where intimidation must be hidden in plain sight.
