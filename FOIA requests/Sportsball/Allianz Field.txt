Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, environmental assessments, technical specifications, or interagency communications from 2010 (planning and design) to present concerning Allianz Field stadium infrastructure and associated public art installations, including the giant loon statue.

This includes:
	•	Environmental impact assessments or wildlife monitoring reports addressing whether stadium lighting, electromagnetic field (EMF) emissions, or large metallic art installations (e.g., the loon statue) may affect avian navigation or magnetoreception.
	•	Records analyzing the dual-use potential of Allianz Field infrastructure for both sports/cultural events and crowd entrainment, continuity theater, or AR overlay systems.
	•	Technical specifications of the loon statue’s materials, wiring, and integration with stadium lighting, broadcast, or field emission systems.
	•	Communications with vendors, contractors, or federal agencies regarding the installation of augmented reality systems, EMF modulation, or crowd simulation technologies at Allianz Field.
	•	Oversight documents or correspondence concerning whether the loon statue was evaluated as a possible EM field resonator or behavioral landmark for entrainment.
	•	Reports or studies comparing bird mortality or disorientation rates at Allianz Field versus U.S. Bank Stadium, with specific reference to magnetoreception-sensitive species (e.g., loons, migratory birds).

To U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) / Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) / Federal Communications Commission (FCC) / Department of Homeland Security (DHS)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, environmental assessments, technical studies, vendor contracts, site/licensing filings, pilot program reports, or interagency communications from 2010 to present concerning Allianz Field (St. Paul, MN) and associated public art installations, including the giant loon statue, with respect to electromagnetic field (EMF) emissions, augmented reality (AR) systems, synthetic crowd/continuity operations, and potential impacts on avian navigation (magnetoreception) and human physiology.

This includes:
	•	Environmental Impact Statements, biological assessments, wildlife monitoring, and post-occupancy studies addressing avian collisions, disorientation, or magnetoreception in proximity to Allianz Field.
	•	Technical specifications, as-built drawings, materials/wiring diagrams, and integration documents for the loon statue and any connections to lighting, broadcast, power, or data systems.
	•	RF/EMF emission surveys, FCC applications/authorizations (e.g., licenses, STAs), spectrum-use plans, compliance testing, or interference analyses related to stadium-integrated transmitters, antennas, DAS/telecom systems, or AR/overlay infrastructure.
	•	Contracts, MOUs, or deliverables with vendors or contractors concerning AR/VR overlay systems, EMF modulation, synthetic crowd generation, or continuity-of-operations theater at or around Allianz Field.
	•	Interagency communications (USFWS, EPA, FCC, DHS) and correspondence with state/local partners (e.g., MN DNR, City of St. Paul) regarding EMF emissions, wildlife impacts, public safety, or crowd-behavior research at the venue.
	•	Incident logs, complaint records, or safety reviews referencing bird mortality, wildlife disorientation, or atypical human physiological responses associated with events at Allianz Field.
	•	Comparative analyses or references to similar issues at other Minnesota venues (e.g., U.S. Bank Stadium) regarding EMF and avian impacts.
