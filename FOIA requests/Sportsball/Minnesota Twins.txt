Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, research proposals, interagency communications, or contractor analyses from 1990 to present concerning the use of Major League Baseball (MLB) salary arbitration processes and datasets in connection with predictive analytics, labor modeling, or financial market applications.

This includes:
	•	Records of data-sharing agreements or contractor access to MLB player performance and arbitration outcomes, including cases involving the Minnesota Twins.
	•	Internal or external analyses treating MLB arbitration hearings as structured predictive models of human performance or labor valuation.
	•	Communications between FMCS, MLB arbitration panels, and private contractors (e.g., Palantir, Booz Allen Hamilton, RAND) concerning the use of arbitration records for behavioral futures modeling, workforce prediction, or market simulations.
	•	Oversight documents or interagency correspondence on whether arbitration-derived datasets have applications beyond sports, including financial derivatives, labor negotiations, or continuity-of-operations modeling.
	•	Reports on the dual-use classification of arbitration datasets as both labor relations records and predictive behavioral market material.

This includes:
	•	Records regarding the use of AR overlays, projection systems, or crowd-simulation software at Target Field (Minnesota Twins), U.S. Bank Stadium (Minnesota Vikings), or other major venues.
	•	Communications with federal agencies (DHS, FEMA, DoD) or private contractors about the use of synthetic crowd projection as part of continuity-of-operations or civil stability planning.
	•	Studies, reports, or evaluations of the behavioral or economic impacts of AR-generated crowd appearances on Minnesota communities or audiences.

To Department of Homeland Security (DHS) / Federal Communications Commission (FCC) / Department of Defense (DoD) / DARPA

Request:

Requesting any and all records, research proposals, contracts, pilot program reports, or interagency communications from 2000 to present concerning the use of augmented reality (AR) overlays, synthetic crowd generation, or continuity-of-operations theater to simulate the appearance of public gatherings, stadium audiences, or civic crowds for broadcast or surveillance purposes.

This includes:
	•	Records on the development or deployment of AR crowd projection systems used to sustain the visual appearance of normal civic or cultural life during periods of attrition or disruption.
	•	Contracts or communications with private vendors (e.g., sports broadcasters, AR/VR developers, defense contractors) regarding synthetic audience overlays in stadiums, public spaces, or media broadcasts.
	•	Oversight documents addressing the classification of AR crowd overlays as continuity theater measures in disaster response or national security contexts.
	•	Research studies on the psychological and behavioral effects of perceiving synthetic crowds in public spaces or media environments.
	•	Interagency correspondence (DHS, DoD, FCC, FEMA) concerning the use of AR overlays in continuity-of-operations planning, emergency broadcast, or civil stability programs.
