Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, research proposals, environmental assessments, monitoring reports, or interagency communications from 2009 (planning and construction) to present concerning U.S. Bank Stadium’s impact on bird mortality and electromagnetic field emissions.

This includes:
	•	Environmental impact studies, wildlife monitoring reports, or contractor assessments of bird mortality rates at U.S. Bank Stadium.
	•	Records analyzing potential links between electromagnetic field (EMF) emissions from the stadium (e.g., broadcast infrastructure, wireless systems, AR/VR overlays, continuity operations) and avian disorientation or mortality.
	•	Communications between state and federal agencies (DNR, MnDOT, DHS, USFWS) regarding U.S. Bank Stadium as a source of magnetospheric disruption and its impact on both wildlife and human physiology.
	•	Vendor contracts or technical specifications describing the design, installation, or operation of high-power transmission, EM field modulation, or augmented reality systems integrated into stadium infrastructure.
	•	Oversight documents, safety reviews, or interagency correspondence concerning whether stadium EMF emissions have behavioral or physiological effects on humans attending games/concerts in addition to wildlife.
	•	Reports of pilot programs, demonstrations, or studies treating U.S. Bank Stadium as a site for entrainment, continuity-of-operations theater, or crowd management research.

To U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) / Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) / Federal Communications Commission (FCC) / Department of Homeland Security (DHS)

Request:

Requesting any and all environmental assessments, technical studies, interagency communications, vendor contracts, or oversight reports from 2009 (planning and construction) to present concerning U.S. Bank Stadium’s impact on bird mortality and electromagnetic field (EMF) emissions.

This includes:
	•	Records of avian mortality studies related to U.S. Bank Stadium, including assessments attributing deaths to glass collisions and any internal deliberations on alternative causes (e.g., EMF emissions, magnetospheric disruption).
	•	Reports analyzing potential links between stadium-integrated broadcast systems, wireless networks, or EM field generators and avian disorientation or navigation interference.
	•	Communications between USFWS, EPA, FCC, and DHS regarding U.S. Bank Stadium as a source of EMF emissions with possible impacts on both wildlife and human physiology.
	•	Technical specifications or vendor contracts describing installation of high-power telecommunications, AR/VR overlay systems, or EM field modulation technologies at the stadium.
	•	Oversight reviews concerning whether environmental studies excluded EMF effects in favor of attributing bird deaths exclusively to glass design.
	•	Records of pilot programs, federally funded research, or demonstrations using U.S. Bank Stadium as a site for entrainment, continuity-of-operations theater, or crowd simulation.
