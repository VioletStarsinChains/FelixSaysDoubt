Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, research proposals, environmental assessments, monitoring reports, or interagency communications from 2009 (planning and construction) to present concerning U.S. Bank Stadium’s impact on bird mortality and electromagnetic field emissions.

This includes:
	•	Environmental impact studies, wildlife monitoring reports, or contractor assessments of bird mortality rates at U.S. Bank Stadium.
	•	Records analyzing potential links between electromagnetic field (EMF) emissions from the stadium (e.g., broadcast infrastructure, wireless systems, AR/VR overlays, continuity operations) and avian disorientation or mortality.
	•	Communications between state and federal agencies (DNR, MnDOT, DHS, USFWS) regarding U.S. Bank Stadium as a source of magnetospheric disruption and its impact on both wildlife and human physiology.
	•	Vendor contracts or technical specifications describing the design, installation, or operation of high-power transmission, EM field modulation, or augmented reality systems integrated into stadium infrastructure.
	•	Oversight documents, safety reviews, or interagency correspondence concerning whether stadium EMF emissions have behavioral or physiological effects on humans attending games/concerts in addition to wildlife.
	•	Reports of pilot programs, demonstrations, or studies treating U.S. Bank Stadium as a site for entrainment, continuity-of-operations theater, or crowd management research.

To U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS) / Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) / Federal Communications Commission (FCC) / Department of Homeland Security (DHS)

Request:

Requesting any and all environmental assessments, technical studies, interagency communications, vendor contracts, or oversight reports from 2009 (planning and construction) to present concerning U.S. Bank Stadium’s impact on bird mortality and electromagnetic field (EMF) emissions.

This includes:
	•	Records of avian mortality studies related to U.S. Bank Stadium, including assessments attributing deaths to glass collisions and any internal deliberations on alternative causes (e.g., EMF emissions, magnetospheric disruption).
	•	Reports analyzing potential links between stadium-integrated broadcast systems, wireless networks, or EM field generators and avian disorientation or navigation interference.
	•	Communications between USFWS, EPA, FCC, and DHS regarding U.S. Bank Stadium as a source of EMF emissions with possible impacts on both wildlife and human physiology.
	•	Technical specifications or vendor contracts describing installation of high-power telecommunications, AR/VR overlay systems, or EM field modulation technologies at the stadium.
	•	Oversight reviews concerning whether environmental studies excluded EMF effects in favor of attributing bird deaths exclusively to glass design.
	•	Records of pilot programs, federally funded research, or demonstrations using U.S. Bank Stadium as a site for entrainment, continuity-of-operations theater, or crowd simulation.

To Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority (MSFA) / City of Minneapolis – Development Services (Inspections & Plan Review) / Hennepin County Property Records & Environmental Services / Minnesota Department of Labor & Industry (Construction Codes & Licensing)

Request:

Requesting any and all records on below-grade construction, mechanical/electrical/plumbing (MEP) systems, HVAC design, refrigeration/cold storage, and secure storage areas at U.S. Bank Stadium from 2009 to present.

This includes:
	•	As-built drawings, sublevel floor plans, and MEP schedules for B-levels and other below-grade spaces (mechanical rooms, electrical rooms, equipment yards).
	•	Equipment inventories and specifications for chillers, ice plants, walk-in coolers/freezers, glycol or ammonia systems, negative-pressure rooms, and any non-concessions cold storage.
	•	Permits, plan review notes, variance requests, inspections, and commissioning reports relevant to HVAC/refrigeration and controlled-access storage areas.
	•	Maintenance logs, service contracts, and work orders for refrigeration or environmental controls not tied to food service.
	•	Hazard assessments, SDS inventories, leak-detection/monitoring reports, and any environmental or industrial hygiene evaluations for sublevel systems.
	•	Loading dock design/operations documents and secure-storage protocols (e.g., access control design, card-reader zones) associated with subgrade areas.
	•	Communications with contractors/engineers (e.g., design-build teams) concerning below-grade mechanical or storage capacities beyond typical event operations.

Request:

Requesting any and all records on continuity-of-operations and emergency management roles assigned to U.S. Bank Stadium from 2009 to present, including mass fatality operations, temporary morgue/cold-chain capacity, crowd simulation/AR continuity, and federal–state coordination.

This includes:
	•	MOUs, contracts, grant files, or task orders designating U.S. Bank Stadium for mass fatality management, temporary mortuary affairs, refrigerated storage, or surge cold-chain capacity.
	•	Emergency plans, CONOPS, logistics annexes, and exercise reports (tabletop/full-scale) referencing U.S. Bank Stadium as a continuity or disaster site (shelter, triage, reunification, or remains management).
	•	Interagency communications (FEMA/CISA/ASPR ↔ State/County/City/MSFA) about resource staging, secure access, and sublevel utilization during declared emergencies or special security events.
	•	Procurement/installation records for telecom, RF/EMF, AR or synthetic-crowd systems tied to continuity or public-order operations at the venue.
	•	After-action reports (AARs), safety reviews, or risk assessments involving crowd control, environmental controls, or cold storage at the stadium.
	•	Funding source documentation (e.g., SHSP/UASI grants) indicating federal support for infrastructure or equipment at U.S. Bank Stadium related to continuity or mass fatality missions.
