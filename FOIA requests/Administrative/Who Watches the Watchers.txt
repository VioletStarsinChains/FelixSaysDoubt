Request:

Requesting any and all documents from 2000 to present regarding interagency coordination of FOIA responses, specifically:
	•	Communications, memoranda, or policy documents describing how FOIA requests are routed or shared between agencies when overlapping subject matter is identified
	•	Internal guidance on managing “high-volume requesters” or individuals/entities submitting large numbers of FOIA requests
	•	Records related to any “watchlists,” “flagging,” or categorization of FOIA requesters for special handling
	•	Interagency agreements, task forces, or working groups organized for the purpose of harmonizing FOIA responses, including with contractors
	•	Any documents referencing the need to preserve narrative consistency across FOIA responses in cases where multiple agencies or offices are implicated
	•	Training materials for FOIA officers on “sensitive subject matter” handling, especially relating to medical research, behavioral studies, surveillance, or predictive modeling

Keywords: FOIA coordination, interagency FOIA task force, requester flagging, high-volume FOIA, narrative consistency, sensitive subject matter handling, contractor coordination, watchlist

Request:

Requesting any and all documents from 2000 to present referencing the coordination of FOIA responses in relation to information control, behavioral modeling, or market impacts, including:
	•	Communications, memoranda, or contracts describing how FOIA responses are strategically managed to shape public understanding of surveillance, medical research, or behavioral programs
	•	Records referencing the use of FOIA delays, exemptions, or selective releases to influence public perception, particularly where such timing could affect behavioral futures markets
	•	Interagency working groups, contractor agreements, or policy discussions about FOIA requesters being used as test subjects in studying information-seeking behavior and its downstream effects
	•	Any mention of FOIA request volume, phrasing, or persistence being modeled as behavioral telemetry, including “red flag” or “high-interest” requesters
	•	Internal guidance on managing FOIA responses where public disclosure could destabilize predictive markets, especially in contexts of health, surveillance, or national security
	•	Documents referencing the economic, social, or behavioral consequences of FOIA disclosures, and whether such consequences are factored into interagency FOIA coordination

Keywords: FOIA behavioral modeling, information control, behavioral futures markets, interagency FOIA coordination, predictive modeling, request telemetry, perception management, disclosure timing

Request:

Requesting any and all documents from 2000 to present regarding the use of FOIA response management as a tool for information control and market influence, including:
	•	Communications, policy documents, or memoranda on the role of FOIA in shaping public perception of government research, surveillance programs, or health initiatives
	•	Records describing or evaluating whether FOIA release timing, delays, or exemptions may create measurable effects on public behavior, discourse, or sentiment
	•	Analysis of FOIA request data as behavioral telemetry, including whether requester persistence, phrasing, or subject matter has been tracked or modeled
	•	Reports, risk assessments, or working group discussions about whether selective disclosure or redaction practices could affect behavioral futures markets or adjacent predictive modeling systems
	•	Contractor or interagency agreements discussing how information-seeking behaviors revealed through FOIA can be used as input to broader analytics programs
	•	Any internal acknowledgment that FOIA response strategy itself might function as a variable in market manipulation or public behavior prediction

Keywords: FOIA behavioral modeling, request telemetry, information-seeking behavior, behavioral futures markets, perception management, disclosure timing, selective transparency, predictive analytics
