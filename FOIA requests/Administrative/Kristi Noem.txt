Request:
Requesting all documents, contracts, communications, or research initiatives related to the use of Kristi Noem and South Dakota political structures as avatars for behavioral futures market simulations from 2005 to present.

This includes:
	•	Analyses of Kristi Noem’s public persona as a synthetic compliance anchor, designed to test thresholds of audience tolerance and betrayal response.
	•	Use of South Dakota’s unique financial and legal environment (trust laws, shell registrations) as parallel test sites for non-person entity modeling.
	•	Cross-references between political media campaigns in South Dakota and entrainment experiments in other domains (consumer products, public health compliance, surveillance adoption).
	•	Research or communications describing the deployment of “synthetic celebrity arcs” (politicians as ARG characters) in controlled experiments to measure volatility, compliance, or radicalization.
	•	Contractor reports on the role of South Dakota as a behavioral “sandbox” state due to its small population, centralized media environment, and loose corporate regulations.
