I request a fee waiver because disclosure of the requested records is in the public interest. Neurotechnology and behavioral modeling are areas of rapid research and deployment with direct implications for privacy, civil liberties, and the future of government surveillance. Alex Karp, as CEO of Palantir Technologies, is a key figure in the development and commercialization of data-driven surveillance and predictive analytics systems, including those used by federal agencies. Records linking neurotechnology research to Alex Karp or Palantir will significantly contribute to public understanding of how emerging neural interfaces and behavioral modeling technologies may be integrated into government operations. Disclosure will not further a commercial interest of the requester but will instead serve the broader public by illuminating potential impacts on individual rights and democratic oversight.
