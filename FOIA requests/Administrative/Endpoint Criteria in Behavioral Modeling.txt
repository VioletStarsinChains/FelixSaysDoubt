To: DARPA / DoE / CDC / OSTP / 

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, protocols, after-action reports, program evaluation summaries, or research closure statements from January 1, 1990 to present referencing endpoint criteria or saturation thresholds for human-subject research programs involving:
•	Trust degradation (including terms such as loyalty inversion, engineered trust collapse, social network resilience testing, relationship stress inoculation)
•	Health destabilization (including sustained inflammation induction, environmental stress testing, or controlled illness modeling)
•	Resource control (including deprivation/abundance cycles, contingency-based resource access, or scarcity simulation)
•	Sensory overload (including hypersensory exposure, synthetic sensory hallucinations, or environmental signal flooding)

This request includes, but is not limited to:
•	Documents outlining termination criteria, saturation points, or conditions under which a subject is considered to no longer provide novel or actionable data in the above domains.
•	Internal communications, meeting notes, or interagency memos discussing diminishing returns or protocol exhaustion for specific individuals or demographic categories.
•	Contractor deliverables or performance reviews referencing endpoint evaluation for trust degradation, health destabilization, resource control, or sensory overload trials.
•	Statistical or modeling reports demonstrating changes in response amplitude over repeated exposures and the decision-making process for protocol retirement or variable pivoting.

Keywords: protocol closure, endpoint criteria, saturation threshold, diminishing returns, trust degradation, loyalty inversion, engineered trust collapse, social network resilience, relationship stress inoculation, health destabilization, resource control, scarcity simulation, sensory overload, synthetic hallucination, environmental signal flooding, protocol retirement
