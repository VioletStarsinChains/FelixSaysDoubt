To Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) / Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) / Department of Defense (DoD)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, communications, contracts, or research studies from 2000 to present referencing the use of housing access as a behavioral conditioning lever in relation to pharmacological trials, neurotechnology applications, or behavioral futures modeling.

This includes:
	•	Policies or pilot programs where housing stability is contingent on compliance with drug tapering, substitution therapies, or experimental protocols
	•	Communications between HUD, HHS, and DoD regarding housing as a “stabilization chamber” for controlled behavioral research
	•	Studies exploring how housing insecurity or homelessness affects emotional volatility, affective flattening, or data yield in predictive modeling
	•	Internal memos or research reports analyzing housing as a compliance-reward mechanism for subjects in covert or overt human experimentation programs
	•	Any documentation tying housing allocation to outcomes in addiction, psychiatric, or neurotech treatment cohorts

Keywords: housing compliance, pharmacological tapering, neurotech conditioning, behavioral futures modeling, survival mode affect, volatility yield, experimental stabilization, HUD-HHS coordination, reward lever

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, communications, contracts, or research studies from 2000 to present referencing the use of housing access or denial as a coercive mechanism in human experimentation programs, particularly where subjects were required to comply with pharmacological, psychiatric, or neurotechnology protocols in order to receive shelter.

This includes:
	•	Reports or internal reviews describing housing as a reward or punishment system within behavioral trials or covert experimentation frameworks
	•	Documentation on the deliberate induction of homelessness or housing insecurity to suppress affective volatility or reduce data noise in subjects
	•	Records analyzing the restoration of housing as a method of re-activating volatility for predictive behavioral modeling or neurotech yield
	•	Communications between HUD, HHS, and DoD on the ethical implications of tying housing access to compliance with medical or technological experimentation
	•	Studies or pilot programs where vulnerable populations (e.g., unhoused individuals, veterans, disabled persons) were selectively housed or displaced to test compliance, volatility, or trust-dynamics in controlled environments

Keywords: coercive housing, experimentation reward system, homelessness induction, volatility suppression, neurotech housing lever, behavioral futures coercion, pharmacological compliance, HUD-HHS-DoD coordination
