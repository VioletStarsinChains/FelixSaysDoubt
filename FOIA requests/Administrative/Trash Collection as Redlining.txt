Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, internal communications, or investigative reports from 2000 to present concerning the use of waste-hauler service contracts (e.g., Waste Management, Republic Services, or affiliated subsidiaries) as determinants of housing access or mobility.

This includes:
	•	Records of housing providers, municipalities, or property management companies restricting tenancy to properties under a specific waste-hauler’s contract.
	•	Communications referencing “vendor continuity,” “waste services,” “utility bundling,” or “data continuity” as criteria in housing placement or tenant screening.
	•	Research or enforcement actions involving functional redlining through utilities, waste services, or municipal contracts.
	•	Risk assessments or policy papers on how waste contractor assignments can create de facto segregation or housing restrictions not visible in standard redlining analyses.
	•	Any joint investigations between HUD, FTC, DOJ, or state attorneys general into waste service contracts as potential vectors of surveillance, discrimination, or tenant control.
	•	Complaints, whistleblower reports, or litigation referencing waste contractor continuity limiting housing choice across multiple jurisdictions.

To: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) / Office of Research and Development / Office of Land and Emergency Management

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, pilot programs, internal communications, contractor deliverables, or grant-funded research from 2000 to present concerning the use of waste-hauler contracts and smart waste technologies (e.g., RFID-enabled bins, optical sorting, IoT-enabled trucks) for purposes of data collection, surveillance, or behavioral analysis.

This includes:
	•	Records on smart waste pilot programs involving Waste Management, Republic Services, or other national waste-haulers.
	•	Communications referencing RFID bins, GPS truck tracking, or optical sorters as tools for data collection on individual households or tenants.
	•	Studies or proposals examining the use of waste-stream analysis to infer consumer behavior, health conditions, or identity-linked patterns.
	•	Reports, contracts, or oversight reviews addressing how waste contractor continuity may create longitudinal datasets on specific individuals or populations.
	•	Documents on the intersection of municipal trash service contracts and housing access, including any acknowledgment of potential discriminatory or continuity-filtering effects.
	•	Risk assessments or internal ethics reviews on the privacy, civil rights, or fair housing implications of smart waste initiatives.
	•	Complaints, enforcement actions, or litigation records alleging misuse of waste-hauler data for surveillance, targeting, or tenant restriction.
