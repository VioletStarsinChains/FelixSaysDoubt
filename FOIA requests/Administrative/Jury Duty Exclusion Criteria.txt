	•	Any mention of designations such as “non-person entity” (NPE) or similar administrative codes that would suppress jury eligibility
	•	Technical documentation of the data integration process (voter registration, DMV records, federal databases) that governs how jury pools are created, and how exclusions are applied
	•	Correspondence with external contractors or federal agencies (e.g., DHS, DOJ) concerning data cross-matching for jury eligibility
	•	Risk assessments, oversight reviews, or Inspector General evaluations regarding errors, omissions, or silent exclusions in jury summons systems

	•	Any agreements or correspondence between DHS, DOJ, and the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC) or state jury administration offices concerning cross-matching jury eligibility with federal databases
	•	Technical documentation of data-sharing mechanisms (between jury management systems, voter/DMV databases, and federal security lists) used to filter potential jurors
