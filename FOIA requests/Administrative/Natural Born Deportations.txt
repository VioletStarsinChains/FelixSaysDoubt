Request:

Requesting any and all records from January 1, 1975 to present concerning investigations, removals, passport denials, certificate-of-citizenship denials, or other adverse actions taken against individuals asserting birth in the United States (“natural‑born” claims) where case files, referrals, or internal commentary reference irregular or international adoption, identity substitution, non‑paternity events (NPEs), or Cold War–era child‑theft pipelines (e.g., Operation Condor/Dirty War cases).

This includes:
	•	Case files, referrals, notices to appear, charging documents, and FDNS/HSI fraud referrals involving claimed U.S.-born persons tied to irregular adoption or parentage anomalies
	•	Interagency communications among ICE, USCIS, DOS (Passport & OCI), EOIR, HHS/ACF, state vital records offices, and foreign consulates regarding identity substitution or suspected non‑parentage
	•	Policies, training materials, legal memos, and guidance on vetting U.S. birth claims involving adoption irregularities, use of EVVE/vital records verification, and genetic testing/DNA requests
	•	Records referencing historical child abduction/transfer programs (e.g., Operation Condor, Southern Cone “disappeared” children, Central American conflict adoptions) in the context of citizenship adjudication or removal
	•	Passport and CRBA adjudication records (approvals/denials, revocations) noting NPE, identity substitution, or irregular adoption indicators
	•	OIG reviews, audits, or complaints and any statistics or dashboards tracking removals or denials later found to involve U.S. citizens or lawful nationals (“wrongful removal” / remedial actions)
	•	Communications or MOUs with private DNA/genealogy vendors related to identity or parentage verification in these matters
