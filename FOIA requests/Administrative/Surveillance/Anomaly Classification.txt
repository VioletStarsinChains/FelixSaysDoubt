To DHS / Privacy Office (including ICE, CBP, USCIS components)

Request:

Requesting any and all records from 2012 to present concerning the assignment, maintenance, or removal of “anomaly” classifications for individuals, including but not limited to: data-source catalogs, model/feature documentation, audit logs, decision justifications, source lineage, retention schedules, and integration guides that reference in-body/implant telemetry or biosensor streams. Please include records indicating whether implant-derived data (directly or via derived features) was relied upon to assign or sustain an anomaly label, and any procedures for declassification and purge where such reliance is found.

This includes:
	•	Source catalogs and data-use inventories listing “implant,” “biosensor,” “telemetry,” “medical device,” or vendor SDKs for in-body sensors
	•	Model cards/feature lists, feature lineage/graph exports, and decision-explanation logs for anomaly labels
	•	Policies, SOPs, and guidance on lawful bases, consent, or warrants for any implant-sourced data
	•	Declassification procedures, purge workflows, notices to subjects, and remediation protocols when anomaly labels are tainted by implant-sourced data
	•	Communications with federal, state, or contractor partners (including Palantir) regarding use of implant-derived streams in anomaly detection
	•	Audit reports, assessments, or after-action reviews on misclassification or improper data sourcing

Keywords: anomaly classification, feature lineage, implant telemetry, biosensor, medical device data, Palantir, Gotham, audit log, declassification, purge, model card, data source catalog

To FBI / DOJ (including CJIS and NSD, as applicable)

Request:

Requesting any and all records from 2012 to present related to anomaly or similar classifications used in investigative analytics platforms, including data-source inventories, feature lineages, model documentation, audit logs, and policies describing any ingestion of implant-derived or in-body biosensor data. Also requesting records of declassification, purge, or remediation where such implant-sourced data contributed to a classification.

This includes:
	•	Decision logs and explanations referencing physiological/telemetry fields inconsistent with ex-vivo sources
	•	Integration documents or vendor interfaces enabling in-body device data ingestion
	•	Standard operating procedures for removing tainted labels and notifying impacted individuals

Keywords: anomaly label, implant, biosensor, telemetry, feature lineage, Palantir, audit trail, declassification, purge, CJIS, model governance

To [City/State Agency Name] / Police Department / Records Unit (Public Records Act)

Request:

Requesting records from 2012 to present concerning classification of individuals as anomalies (or equivalent label) within analytic platforms used by the department, including source catalogs, model/feature documentation, audit logs, decision explanations, and any references to implant-derived or in-body biosensor data. Also requesting policies and actions related to declassification and purge where implant-sourced data is present.

This includes:
	•	Platform data dictionaries and source lists (including contractor integrations)
	•	Audit extracts showing features/fields that fed anomaly labels
	•	Removal/declassification protocols and any notices provided to affected persons

Keywords: anomaly, classification, implant telemetry, biosensor, Palantir, vendor integration, audit, declassification, purge
