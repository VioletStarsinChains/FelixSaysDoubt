To Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) / Department of Defense (DoD) / Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, communications, or research studies from 2000 to present regarding the use of residential housing units as controlled environments for behavioral experimentation, synthetic experience staging, or predictive modeling trials, particularly where such use contributed to perceived or actual housing scarcity.

This includes:
	•	Internal memos or studies on the allocation of multi-bedroom apartments for human experimentation, neurotechnology deployment, or synthetic construct integration
	•	Records on the deliberate withdrawal of rental inventory from the open market to serve as behavioral test rigs or closed-loop observation environments
	•	Communications between HUD, DoD, and HHS regarding housing scarcity as an externality of experimental housing programs
	•	Reports analyzing the economic and social effects of sequestering housing inventory for use as controlled environments in predictive modeling or behavioral futures markets
	•	Documentation acknowledging the role of synthetic residents, handler avatars, or non-person entities in the occupation of federally tracked housing units

Keywords: housing scarcity, experimental housing units, synthetic residents, neurotech apartments, predictive modeling rig, sequestered housing, HUD-DoD coordination, behavioral futures housing

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, communications, or research studies from 2000 to present referencing the removal of residential housing units from the open market for use as experimental containment environments, particularly where anomalies were co-housed with synthetic constructs, handler avatars, or other non-person entities.

This includes:
	•	Records describing the practice of allocating multi-bedroom apartments to a single experimental subject alongside synthetic or non-human counterparts, effectively sequestering housing stock from public use
	•	Internal communications on how such experimental “domestic laboratories” contribute to or exacerbate perceived housing shortages in metropolitan areas
	•	Reports analyzing the dual function of manufactured scarcity: creating controlled environments for behavioral futures modeling while simultaneously generating market volatility in housing demand
	•	Documentation acknowledging the ethical implications of fabricating a “housing shortage” through inventory diversion for covert human experimentation programs
	•	Interagency correspondence between HUD, DoD, and HHS regarding the classification, tracking, or justification of experimental housing units in federal reporting

Keywords: manufactured housing shortage, synthetic co-housing, anomaly containment, sequestered housing stock, experimental apartments, domestic laboratories, non-person entities, behavioral futures scarcity
