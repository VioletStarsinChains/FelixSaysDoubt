Request:

Requesting any and all internal communications, policy documents, contracts, research proposals, or oversight reports from 2000 to present that reference or relate to the concept of “permanent surveillance designation” in human subjects, populations, or operational environments.

This includes but is not limited to:
	•	Records describing criteria or thresholds for placing individuals or populations under indefinite monitoring, including cross-referenced behavioral, medical, or technological markers.
	•	Documents outlining the legal or procedural mechanisms for sustaining indefinite surveillance status beyond initial justification periods.
	•	Research proposals or contracts addressing predictive modeling, risk assessment, or anomaly tracking where the designation of “permanent surveillance” is a categorical outcome.
	•	Interagency communications regarding “sunset” or termination criteria for surveillance designations, or lack thereof.
	•	Policy or oversight reports evaluating the ethical, legal, or operational implications of “permanent” or “indefinite” subject tethering to surveillance systems.

Keywords: permanent surveillance designation, indefinite monitoring protocol, subject tethering, anomaly tracking, behavioral futures monitoring, risk designation permanence, surveillance retention policy

Request:

Requesting any and all internal communications, contracts, research proposals, or oversight documents from 2000 to present that reference or relate to “permanent surveillance designation” of human subjects, with particular attention to systems involving neurotechnology tethering, behavioral futures markets, and predictive modeling infrastructure.

This includes but is not limited to:
	•	Records describing experimental frameworks in which surveillance designation is made irreversible or bound to a subject through neurotechnological integration or biometric coupling.
	•	Communications regarding the use of “lifetime tethering” or equivalent terminology in programs involving neural interfaces, cognitive telemetry, or behavioral telemetry systems.
	•	Research proposals describing the monetization of surveillance designations via behavioral futures trading, credit scoring, or algorithmic profiling.
	•	Interagency agreements or contracts with private sector firms, including social media platforms or data brokers, for the exploitation of permanent surveillance cohorts.
	•	Oversight reports or ethical analyses addressing the risks of indefinite or inescapable surveillance designations, particularly when tied to experimental populations or vulnerable cohorts.

Keywords: permanent surveillance designation, neurotech tethering, behavioral futures markets, lifetime subject monitoring, surveillance commodification, predictive behavior monetization, indefinite designation protocol
