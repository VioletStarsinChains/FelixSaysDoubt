To HUD / FCC / DOE / DHS

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, research proposals, internal communications, or regulatory discussions from 1990 to present regarding the use of real estate and built environments as infrastructure for technological entrainment, cognitive modulation, or behavioral influence systems.

This includes:
	•	Records on the installation or testing of entrainment technologies (acoustic, electromagnetic, optical, or wireless) in housing developments, hotels, or commercial properties
	•	Communications between agencies and telecom or utility providers regarding embedding entrainment hardware in smart meters, WiFi routers, HVAC systems, or lighting infrastructure tied to residential or rental properties
	•	Analyses of zoning, building codes, or federal housing projects as vectors for large-scale deployment of entrainment-capable systems
	•	Reports on partnerships between property management firms, real estate developers, and technology contractors for surveillance or behavioral modulation purposes
	•	Studies on the role of vacant properties, dark inventory, or federally subsidized housing in supporting test environments for entrainment systems
	•	Risk assessments on potential health, safety, or civil liberties impacts of entrainment-capable infrastructure in the housing sector

Keywords: entrainment infrastructure, real estate, behavioral modulation, cognitive entrainment, smart housing, zoning, smart meters, HUD, FCC, DOE, DHS, surveillance architecture

To HUD / FCC / DOE / DHS / GSA

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, research proposals, internal communications, or regulatory discussions from 1990 to present regarding the integration of technological entrainment infrastructure into built environments for the purposes of cognitive modulation, behavioral influence, or surveillance.

This includes:
	•	Records on the installation or testing of entrainment technologies (acoustic, electromagnetic, optical, or wireless) in housing, schools, hospitals, transit hubs, government buildings, and commercial real estate
	•	Communications with telecom, utility, or defense contractors regarding embedding entrainment-capable hardware in smart meters, WiFi routers, HVAC systems, lighting, or building management systems
	•	Analyses of zoning, building codes, and federal construction projects as vectors for widespread deployment of entrainment systems
	•	Reports on the role of vacant properties, dark inventory, and federally subsidized infrastructure as controlled test environments for entrainment technologies
	•	Contracts or pilot programs with real estate developers, hotel chains, school districts, or stadium operators that included behavioral modulation or entrainment capacities
	•	Risk assessments or internal evaluations of health, safety, or civil liberties impacts related to entrainment-capable infrastructure in public or private built environments

Keywords: entrainment infrastructure, built environments, behavioral modulation, cognitive entrainment, smart buildings, zoning, smart meters, surveillance architecture, FCC, HUD, DOE, DHS, GSA
