Request:

Requesting all documents, audits, contracts, and correspondence from 2005–present regarding the possibility that police department overtime expenditures are being used as a cover for the funding of surveillance analysts, predictive modeling staff, or subcontracted vendors.

This includes:
	•	Records comparing declared overtime hours with actual deployment logs, especially in divisions using automated patrol systems, drones, or AR-assisted operations
	•	Internal communications discussing budget justifications for overtime in the context of reduced frontline staffing due to automation
	•	Financial breakdowns of overtime expenditures routed to third-party vendors (e.g., Palantir, Axon, Motorola Solutions, ShotSpotter)
	•	Memos or reports evaluating whether “overtime” is functioning as a budgetary shell to obscure the true scale of surveillance analyst employment
	•	Contracts or task orders that correlate overtime allocations with remote monitoring, fusion center activity, or data-driven policing initiatives
	•	Risk assessments, whistleblower reports, or inspector general audits referencing “double-counted” or “laundered” overtime funds
