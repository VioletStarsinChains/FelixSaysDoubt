FOIA – Environmental & Entomological Research

To: U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) / Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) / Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, reports, contracts, or interagency communications from 1990 to present concerning research, field trials, or monitoring programs involving synthetic or engineered cicadas, robotic insect constructs, or artificial insect molts deployed in U.S. environments.

This includes:
	•	Records of USDA or EPA oversight of engineered cicada populations for pest control, pollination, or environmental monitoring
	•	Contracts with universities or defense contractors for robotic insect development or field testing
	•	Reports on environmental impacts of synthetic cicada molts, chitin substitutes, or other artificial detritus left in public spaces
	•	Internal analyses describing cicadas or cicada byproducts as vectors for environmental exposure or ecological experiments

Keywords: cicada, engineered insect, robotic insect, synthetic molt, USDA, APHIS, EPA, environmental monitoring, bio-synthetic construct, entomological research

FOIA (Spicy Angle – Behavioral Futures & Environmental Contamination)

To: Department of Defense (DoD) / Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) / Department of Homeland Security (DHS)

Request:
Requesting any and all documents, contracts, communications, or internal analyses from 1990 to present concerning the use of robotic or bio-synthetic cicadas as tools for environmental contamination, behavioral futures modeling, or population-level stress testing.

This includes:
	•	Programs involving deployment of robotic cicadas or artificial cicada molts as environmental contamination agents
	•	Communications with contractors or municipalities regarding cicada-like constructs as testbeds for human behavioral response to swarms, noise, or seasonal phenomena
	•	Reports describing synthetic cicada detritus as a vector for biohazards, nanoparticles, or psychological stressors
	•	Analyses linking cicada deployments to compliance testing, entrainment, or civilian exposure modeling

Keywords: cicada, robotic insect, bio-synthetic construct, synthetic molt, environmental contamination, behavioral futures, DARPA, DHS, DoD, population stress test
