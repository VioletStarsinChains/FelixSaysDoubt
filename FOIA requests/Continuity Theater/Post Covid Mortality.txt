FOIA – Excess Mortality Analysis

To: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) / National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) / Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, reports, contracts, or interagency communications from 2020 to present concerning excess mortality in the United States, with particular emphasis on 2022–2025 compared to 2020–2021.

This includes:
	•	Reports quantifying excess deaths post-Covid relative to baseline pre-pandemic years
	•	Analyses stratifying excess mortality by age group, cause of death, and geographic region during 2022–2025
	•	Contracts or communications with universities, think tanks, or private contractors conducting post-pandemic mortality modeling
	•	Internal assessments or memoranda describing potential under-reporting of mortality or discrepancies between official statistics and real-world attrition

Keywords: excess mortality, post-Covid mortality, 2022–2025 mortality, NCHS, CDC, HHS, under-reporting, mortality analysis, population attrition

FOIA (Spicy Angle – Continuity & Synthetic Populations)

To: Department of Homeland Security (DHS) / Department of Defense (DoD) / Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, contracts, reports, or internal analyses from 2020 to present concerning continuity of operations, synthetic population overlays, or behavioral futures modeling deployed to mask or compensate for elevated post-Covid mortality in the United States.

This includes:
	•	Records describing the use of synthetic population models or overlays to maintain the appearance of stable population density between 2022–2025
	•	Analyses of continuity theater mechanisms (e.g., ecological abundance signals, companion animal behavior modulation, or simulated consumer activity) to counteract perception of population decline
	•	Communications with contractors or municipalities regarding continuity operations tied to mortality concealment
	•	Reports linking post-Covid excess mortality to synthetic continuity measures in behavioral futures or national resilience frameworks

Keywords: continuity of operations, synthetic population overlay, continuity theater, post-Covid mortality, population attrition, behavioral futures, DARPA, DHS, DoD
