FOIA – Climate Change & Urban Fruit Yields

To: U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) / National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) / Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, reports, contracts, or interagency communications from 2000 to present concerning the effects of climate change on fruit production from residential and non-commercial fruit trees in U.S. urban and suburban environments.

This includes:
	•	Records of USDA or NOAA-funded studies on climate change impacts on flowering, fruiting cycles, and productivity of non-commercial fruit trees
	•	Contracts with universities or local governments to monitor urban orchard productivity or residential fruit yield
	•	Reports on changes in fruit density, drop rates, or seasonality in urban/suburban settings
	•	Internal analyses linking climate change to observable increases in fruit production outside of commercial agriculture

Keywords: urban fruit trees, residential fruit production, climate change impacts, fruiting cycles, non-commercial orchards, USDA, NOAA, EPA, urban agriculture

FOIA (Spicy Angle – Engineered Over-Fruiting as Continuity Theater)

To: Department of Homeland Security (DHS) / Department of Defense (DoD) / Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, contracts, reports, or interagency communications from 2000 to present concerning the deliberate engineering or modulation of residential fruit tree productivity as part of continuity theater, environmental contamination, or behavioral futures research.

This includes:
	•	Programs involving chemical, genetic, or synthetic modification of urban/residential fruit trees to increase fruit yield or exaggerate ecological abundance
	•	Communications with contractors, municipalities, or defense agencies regarding fruit drop as a tool for continuity signaling or environmental exposure modeling
	•	Reports describing engineered over-fruiting as a means of masking ecological disruption, population decline, or mortality spikes
	•	Internal analyses connecting non-commercial fruit production to continuity theater, synthetic population overlays, or behavioral stabilization frameworks

Keywords: engineered fruit yield, residential fruit trees, continuity theater, ecological abundance signaling, behavioral futures, DARPA, DHS, DoD, over-fruiting, environmental contamination
