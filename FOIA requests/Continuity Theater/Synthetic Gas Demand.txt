This includes:
	•	Studies or audits cross-referencing gas consumption with traffic data, census estimates, and population changes
	•	Communications or reports addressing anomalies in fuel demand not aligning with demographic or transportation trends
	•	Contracts or agreements with private vendors providing synthetic traffic data, demand modeling, or AR/VR continuity simulations
	•	Records on how synthetic or drone-based vehicle activity may be factored into national fuel consumption statistics
	•	Internal assessments of whether gas price stability is being artificially maintained despite population attrition or reduced consumer demand
	•	Inspector General or oversight reports regarding manipulation of fuel usage metrics or price-setting mechanisms

Keywords: synthetic traffic, continuity theater, fuel demand anomalies, gas price stability, demand simulation, drone vehicles, EIA audits, FTC fuel market oversight, population attrition, transportation modeling
