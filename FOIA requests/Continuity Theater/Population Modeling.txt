Request:
Requesting any and all documents, reports, contracts, or interagency communications from 2019 to present concerning the use of synthetic population datasets, digital twins, or agent-based modeling for pandemic planning and mortality projection during the Covid-19 era.

This includes:
	•	Records describing the use of synthetic populations to adjust for incomplete or delayed mortality reporting
	•	Contracts with universities, contractors, or modeling firms providing agent-based simulations of U.S. or global populations
	•	Internal analyses comparing real-world mortality data to simulated projections for continuity of public health reporting
	•	Reports assessing the integration of synthetic population data into official dashboards, forecasts, or public communications

Keywords: synthetic population, agent-based modeling, digital twin, mortality projection, child mortality, Covid-19 modeling, pandemic simulation, mortality data adjustment, DHS, CDC, HHS

To: Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) / Department of Defense (DoD) / Department of Homeland Security (DHS)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, communications, contracts, or internal analyses from 2019 to present concerning the use of synthetic population simulations, AR overlays, or behavioral futures modeling to conceal or compensate for real-world mortality during the Covid-19 pandemic.

This includes:
	•	Records of programs using agent-based simulations or augmented reality to maintain the appearance of stable population levels despite excess mortality
	•	Communications with contractors, NGOs, or foreign partners regarding simulated stand-ins for deceased individuals, households, children, or companion animals
	•	Reports describing the use of synthetic or simulated populations to sustain economic demand forecasts, housing markets, or consumer confidence during Covid-19
	•	Analyses linking synthetic population replacement to grief modulation, psychological stabilization, or crowd behavior entrainment

Keywords: Covid-19, synthetic population, AR overlay, mortality concealment, behavioral futures, agent-based simulation, demand forecasting, DARPA, DHS, DoD, grief stabilization, child mortality
