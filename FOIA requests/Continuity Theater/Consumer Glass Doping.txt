FOIA – Rare-Earth Doping in Consumer Glassware

To: Department of Energy (DOE – Office of Science, Critical Materials Institute) / Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) / Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, contracts, grants, reports, or interagency communications from 1990 to present concerning the use of rare-earth elements, quantum dots, or other dopants in consumer glassware and decorative materials (including vase beads, aquarium stones, and ornamental glass).

This includes:
	•	Research on luminescent or color-shifting glass beads, marbles, or decorative crystals
	•	Reports on environmental and health safety of doped glassware sold for household use
	•	Analyses of industrial supply chains linking rare earths or quantum dots to consumer décor markets
	•	Communications with manufacturers or importers about decorative glass products containing engineered additives
	•	Records regarding material recycling, reuse, or hazardous waste classification for doped decorative glass

Keywords: rare earth glass, doped glassware, vase beads, aquarium stones, ornamental glass, quantum dots, luminescent materials, DOE, EPA, CPSC

FOIA (Spicy Angle – Decorative Glass as Continuity Nodes or Entrainment Props)

To: Department of Defense (DoD – DARPA, USAMRDC) / Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) / Department of Homeland Security (DHS – S&T)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, pilots, reports, contracts, or internal analyses from 1990 to present concerning the use of doped decorative materials (such as glass vase beads, aquarium stones, or ornamental crystals) as distributed sensing or entrainment platforms.

This includes:
	•	Records describing nitrogen-vacancy-like defects, quantum dots, or rare-earth doping applied to consumer décor items as covert sensors
	•	Analyses of decorative beads as environmental continuity anchors, AR projection nodes, or passive entrainment devices
	•	Reports on household or public-space distribution of doped decorative glass for surveillance, behavior modeling, or continuity theater purposes
	•	Communications with contractors or vendors supplying doped decorative glassware to consumer or institutional markets
	•	Risk/benefit assessments of disguising engineered sensing materials as everyday household décor

Keywords: nitrogen vacancy, doped glass, decorative beads, continuity theater, entrainment props, DARPA, IARPA, DHS, ornamental sensors
