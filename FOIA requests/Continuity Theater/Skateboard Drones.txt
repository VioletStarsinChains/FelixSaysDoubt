FOIA – Micro-Drone Pilots for Urban Mobility & Crowd Modeling

To: Department of Transportation (DOT – Federal Highway Administration, Federal Transit Administration) / National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) / Department of Defense (DoD – Defense Innovation Unit)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, contracts, reports, or interagency communications from 2000 to present concerning the use of micro-drones, ground drones, or small unmanned vehicles in urban environments for mobility studies, public safety, or crowd modeling.

This includes:
	•	Pilot projects or demonstrations of low-profile drones for data collection in pedestrian or recreational areas
	•	Contracts with private vendors supplying skateboards, scooters, or micro-mobility devices embedded with sensing or control systems
	•	Reports on urban drone deployments disguised as consumer objects for safety or compliance testing
	•	Communications regarding drone-based observation of pedestrian flows, crowd safety, or mobility forecasting

Keywords: micro-drone, ground drone, urban mobility, scooter, skateboard, unmanned systems, DOT, NIST, DIU

FOIA – Procurement of Smart Skateboards/Scooters

To: General Services Administration (GSA) / Department of Transportation (DOT – Federal Highway Administration, Federal Transit Administration) / Department of Homeland Security (DHS – Procurement & S&T)

Request:
Requesting any and all procurement records, contracts, purchase orders, vendor agreements, or interagency communications from 2000 to present concerning the acquisition or deployment of “smart” skateboards, scooters, or micro-mobility devices by federal agencies.

This includes:
	•	Contracts for skateboards, scooters, or similar micro-mobility devices advertised as “smart,” “connected,” or sensor-enabled
	•	Records describing embedded electronics, GPS modules, wireless connectivity, or autonomous features in these devices
	•	Reports on use of such devices in pilot programs for urban mobility, recreation, or public space management
	•	Communications with private vendors supplying “smart” recreational hardware to federal agencies or municipalities under federal funding
	•	Records of large-scale or bulk procurement of recreational mobility devices beyond typical administrative use

Keywords: smart skateboard, connected scooter, micro-mobility procurement, sensor-enabled mobility, DOT, GSA, DHS

FOIA (Spicy Angle – Skateboard-Cloaked Drone Nodes for Continuity Theater)

To: Department of Defense (DoD – DARPA, USAMRDC) / Department of Homeland Security (DHS – S&T, CISA) / Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, pilots, contracts, reports, or internal analyses from 2000 to present concerning the use of skateboard-like drones or perceptionally cloaked unmanned devices as distributed entrainment or continuity-theater infrastructure in civilian environments.

This includes:
	•	Records describing low-profile drones disguised as skateboards, scooters, or similar recreational props for urban deployment
	•	Reports on entrainment fields or behavioral modulation networks using mobile drone nodes embedded in public space
	•	Analyses of “continuity cloaking” in which drones are perceptionally masked as ordinary human-scale objects to preserve crowd realism
	•	Communications with contractors or labs developing skateboard-shaped drones or cloaking systems for behavioral modeling and continuity theater
	•	Risk/benefit assessments of deploying cloaked drone props in public to sustain continuity illusions following population decline or attrition

Keywords: skateboard drone, cloaked drone, continuity theater, entrainment network, DARPA, DHS, IARPA
