To DARPA / IARPA / Department of Defense / NIH

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, contracts, or internal communications concerning the use of bird vocalizations — including toucans and other tropical species — as natural masking signals for acoustic testing, covert communication, or behavioral entrainment, from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Research on birdsong as a carrier or masking layer for subliminal signals, entrainment patterns, or covert communications
	•	Studies evaluating human detection thresholds when signals are embedded in bird vocalizations
	•	Internal communications regarding use of exotic bird calls (e.g., toucans) in continuity theater, environmental soundscapes, or AR/VR overlays
	•	Contracts with private contractors for development of bird-call–based signal masking systems
	•	Risk assessments or ethical reviews concerning population-scale exposure to entrainment signals embedded in naturalistic soundscapes

Keywords: toucan, bird vocalizations, acoustic masking, covert communication, subliminal signals, continuity theater, behavioral entrainment, bioacoustics, DARPA acoustic research
