To: HUD / DOJ / FBI / DHS

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, communications, or contractor agreements concerning the use of vacant residential properties as controlled environments for behavioral research, particularly where synthetic hallucinations or projected constructs are deployed to interact with individuals in the field.

This includes:
	•	Internal communications regarding “scam listings” used as cover for controlled experiments in vacant housing stock
	•	Research proposals or contracts evaluating vacant properties as low-noise environments for neurotech projection or synthetic hallucination field trials
	•	Any interagency memoranda between HUD and defense/intelligence entities regarding the behavioral utility of maintaining long-term vacancies
	•	Documentation of behavioral futures market modeling tied to vacant-property encounters (e.g., testing compliance, trust in strangers, entry into unsecured dwellings)

Keywords: vacant property, scam listing, synthetic hallucination, behavioral futures markets, HUD, DHS, staging ground, controlled environment, neurotech projection, dark inventory

FOIA — Vacant Properties as Synthetic Theater Sets

To: HUD / DOJ / FBI / DHS / Department of Defense

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, internal communications, or contractor agreements related to the use of vacant or foreclosed residential properties as controlled environments for behavioral testing, particularly where projected synthetic hallucinations are deployed to create immersive “theater set” conditions simulating wilderness or social isolation scenarios.

This includes:
	•	Reports or proposals describing the repurposing of vacant properties as staging grounds for synthetic constructs (e.g., neighbors, hikers, companions)
	•	Documentation of controlled experiments in which an otherwise empty house is used to simulate wilderness-style entrapment, coercion, or abandonment scenarios through neurotech projection
	•	Communications between HUD, DOJ, DHS, or defense contractors regarding vacant housing stock as “synthetic theater” for modeling high-risk behavioral thresholds (e.g., self-harm, compliance, refusal of coercion)
	•	Any behavioral futures market valuation models derived from encounters staged in vacant properties, particularly when testing survival decision-making, gendered coercion dynamics, or abandonment responses

Keywords: vacant property, synthetic theater, wilderness simulation, coercive abandonment, behavioral futures markets, HUD, staging ground, neurotech projection, dark inventory, behavioral threshold modeling
