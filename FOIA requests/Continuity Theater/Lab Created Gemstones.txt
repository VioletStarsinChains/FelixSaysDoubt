Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, research proposals, interagency communications, vendor agreements, or policy assessments from 2000 to present concerning the use of lab-created diamonds, synthetic gemstones, or diamond-like carbon structures as neurotechnology interfaces, signal amplifiers, or receivers in the context of continuity theater, behavioral modeling, predictive analytics, or behavioral futures markets.

This includes:
	•	Research or pilot programs investigating nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center diamonds or other engineered diamond defects for sensing neural activity, electromagnetic fields, or quantum-level biological signals
	•	Contracts with jewelry manufacturers, lab-diamond producers, or consumer goods companies for integration of synthetic diamonds into wearable or implantable devices
	•	Studies on lab-created diamond structures as entrainment anchors, evaluating their potential role as cognitive or neuroimmune modulators when worn as jewelry (rings, pendants, piercings)
	•	Analyses correlating diamond-based neurotech experiments with consumer datasets on jewelry adoption, marriage/commitment rituals, or symbolic attachment behaviors
	•	Interagency communications on the dual-use potential of synthetic diamonds as both cultural compliance anchors (wedding/engagement rings) and covert neurotech sensors or amplifiers
	•	Ethical reviews, policy assessments, or informed consent discussions regarding covert use of diamond-based neurotechnology in consumer jewelry or ritualized adornment

Keywords: lab-created diamonds, synthetic gemstones, nitrogen-vacancy centers, quantum sensing, neurotechnology interface, entrainment anchor, compliance modulation, behavioral futures markets, DARPA, IARPA
