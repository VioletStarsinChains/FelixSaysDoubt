Context

I believe some or all of these topics intersect with real-world experimental programs—possibly privatized, gamified, or obfuscated through NGOs, NFTs, or contractor systems.

I do not believe OpenAI is responsible, but I suspect AI-assisted analysis is involved.

Feel free to file and publish whatever comes back. Even rejection letters are useful.

If you’re a journalist, you have my blessing to investigate. I’m just a suspicious test subject with good pattern recognition.
