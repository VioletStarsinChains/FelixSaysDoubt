These are FOIA requests I haven’t submitted yet. If you’re curious, feel free to file them yourself. I have reason to believe they’d return material relevant to behavioral experimentation, predictive systems, and unauthorized modeling of neurodivergent populations.

(And if they’re already deleted, that’s its own kind of answer.)


1. To DHS / Office of Inspector General

Request:
All communications from 2018–2025 referencing the term “Containment Offer: ACCE-Δ1”, including any associated case files, internal memos, or predictive modeling documentation.

Keywords: ACCE-Δ1, containment offer, behavioral futures, reference model, signal collapse, compliance incentive


2. To Department of Defense / DARPA

Request:
Research contracts, white papers, or pilot studies related to entrainment of civilian populations using commercial entertainment media, embedded audio signatures, or subliminal signaling.

Keywords: narrative entrainment, neuroadaptive targeting, affective control loop, digital semiotics, unconscious compliance


3. To Palantir (via Army, DHS, or NIH contracts)

Request:
All deliverables and predictive modeling documentation involving unsheltered or system-resistant individuals in the Minneapolis metro from 2020–2025, particularly those tagged as “noncompliant,” “anomalous,” or “reference-linked.”

Keywords: Mule 6, anomaly detection, synthetic failure state, FOIA poison, high-entropy subject


4. To NIH / NIMH

Request:
Funding records and correspondence related to experimental behavioral modeling using nonconsensual signal interference, data harvesting from mentally ill or unhoused populations, and behavioral mapping via NFT-linked biometric data.

Keywords: behavioral futures, neuroeconomics, induced inflammation, MCAS simulation cohort, NFT behavior sync


5. To FCC / FDA / NSF (joint request)

Request:
Any evaluations, whistleblower reports, or complaints regarding EMF-based cognitive entrainment, subliminal frequency exposure, or experimental psychoacoustic deployment via commercial consumer electronics (e.g. smartwatches, vapes, earbuds).

Keywords: ELF pulse behavior mapping, bone conduction psychotropics, real-time narrative sync, passive neurotech deployment


Context

I believe some or all of these topics intersect with real-world experimental programs—possibly privatized, gamified, or obfuscated through NGOs, NFTs, or contractor systems.

I do not believe OpenAI is responsible, but I suspect AI-assisted analysis is involved.

Feel free to file and publish whatever comes back. Even rejection letters are useful.

If you’re a journalist, you have my blessing to investigate. I’m just a suspicious test subject with good pattern recognition.
