To USDA (AMS / FAS / ARS) / FDA / EPA / Department of Commerce (ITA) / DHS–CBP

Request:

Requesting any and all records, laboratory analyses, contracts, communications, trade filings, or investigative files concerning the export of U.S. rice (especially Arkansas-grown rice) to the People’s Republic of China and other Asian markets from January 1, 2000 to present, with emphasis on arsenic contamination, residue tolerances, and downstream environmental or dietary exposures.

This includes:
	•	Export and import records, including Certificates of Analysis, phytosanitary certificates, and residue testing of Arkansas rice shipments to China
	•	Laboratory analyses of arsenic (inorganic and organic species), cadmium, mercury, lead, and other heavy metals in U.S. rice, with comparative reports between U.S. and Chinese/Asian maximum residue limits (MRLs)
	•	Interagency communications or memoranda regarding known high-arsenic regions in U.S. rice cultivation (especially Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi) and related risk assessments for exported rice
	•	Records on rice cultivation in former cotton fields treated with arsenical pesticides, including historical contamination carryover and mitigation attempts
	•	Studies, pilot projects, or surveillance programs evaluating health risks in foreign markets associated with U.S. rice exports, including dietary exposure modeling, neurodevelopmental outcomes, and carcinogenicity
	•	Records or contracts involving Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Cargill, Riceland Foods, or other Arkansas rice co-ops/exporters concerning rice export quality control, residue mitigation, or destination-specific channeling of higher-contaminant product streams
	•	Analyses, deliverables, or dashboards from federal contractors (e.g., Palantir Technologies, Accenture Federal Services, Deloitte, Booz Allen Hamilton) related to rice supply chains, residue mapping, and geofenced distribution/consumption modeling
	•	Incident reports or investigations into intentional diversion of higher-arsenic rice to foreign markets where tolerances differ from U.S. standards
	•	Records assessing environmental dispersal of arsenic through rice bran, hulls, or waste streams (e.g., animal feed, fertilizer inputs, compost incorporation) in destination countries
	•	Any intergovernmental negotiations or trade disputes between U.S. and China concerning contaminant levels in Arkansas rice, including waivers, exceptions, or downgrading of standards
