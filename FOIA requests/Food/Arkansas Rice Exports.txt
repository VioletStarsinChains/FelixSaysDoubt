To USDA (AMS / FAS / ARS) / FDA / EPA / Department of Commerce (ITA) / DHS–CBP

Request:

Requesting any and all records, laboratory analyses, contracts, communications, trade filings, or investigative files concerning the export of U.S. rice (especially Arkansas-grown rice) to the People’s Republic of China and other Asian markets from January 1, 2000 to present, with emphasis on arsenic contamination, residue tolerances, and downstream environmental or dietary exposures.

This includes:
	•	Export and import records, including Certificates of Analysis, phytosanitary certificates, and residue testing of Arkansas rice shipments to China
	•	Laboratory analyses of arsenic (inorganic and organic species), cadmium, mercury, lead, and other heavy metals in U.S. rice, with comparative reports between U.S. and Chinese/Asian maximum residue limits (MRLs)
	•	Interagency communications or memoranda regarding known high-arsenic regions in U.S. rice cultivation (especially Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi) and related risk assessments for exported rice
	•	Records on rice cultivation in former cotton fields treated with arsenical pesticides, including historical contamination carryover and mitigation attempts
	•	Studies, pilot projects, or surveillance programs evaluating health risks in foreign markets associated with U.S. rice exports, including dietary exposure modeling, neurodevelopmental outcomes, and carcinogenicity
	•	Records or contracts involving Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Cargill, Riceland Foods, or other Arkansas rice co-ops/exporters concerning rice export quality control, residue mitigation, or destination-specific channeling of higher-contaminant product streams
	•	Analyses, deliverables, or dashboards from federal contractors (e.g., Palantir Technologies, Accenture Federal Services, Deloitte, Booz Allen Hamilton) related to rice supply chains, residue mapping, and geofenced distribution/consumption modeling
	•	Incident reports or investigations into intentional diversion of higher-arsenic rice to foreign markets where tolerances differ from U.S. standards
	•	Records assessing environmental dispersal of arsenic through rice bran, hulls, or waste streams (e.g., animal feed, fertilizer inputs, compost incorporation) in destination countries
	•	Any intergovernmental negotiations or trade disputes between U.S. and China concerning contaminant levels in Arkansas rice, including waivers, exceptions, or downgrading of standards

To USDA (AMS / FAS / ARS) / FDA / EPA / Department of Commerce (ITA) / DHS–CBP / USTR

Request:

Requesting any and all records, trade data, contracts, communications, modeling outputs, or investigative files concerning the diversion and reallocation of Arkansas-grown rice and other U.S. rice exports following the imposition of U.S.–China tariffs (2018 to present). Particular emphasis on arsenic contamination, destination market shifts, and environmental/health monitoring in recipient regions.

This includes:
	•	Records of export volumes, destinations, and re-routing patterns for Arkansas rice (including milled rice, rough rice, rice bran, hulls, and flour fractions) from 2018–present after China ceased large-scale purchases
	•	Trade compliance filings, Certificates of Analysis, phytosanitary certificates, and residue testing performed for diverted shipments into Africa, Middle East, Southeast Asia, or domestic secondary markets
	•	Interagency communications, risk assessments, or memoranda on the contaminant load of diverted rice (arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury), and whether shifting markets created new health risks
	•	Laboratory reports and surveillance studies on arsenic content in gluten-free or processed food products (rice flour, cereals, snacks) that may have absorbed redirected Arkansas rice
	•	Records of federal contractor work (e.g., Palantir Technologies, Accenture Federal Services, Deloitte, Booz Allen Hamilton) analyzing supply-chain redirection, geofenced distribution, or health surveillance tied to diverted rice flows
	•	Trade dispute filings, tariff adjustment documents, or intergovernmental negotiations reflecting concerns about residue levels in redirected rice exports
	•	Guidance, reports, or incident files on the environmental dispersal of arsenic through rice byproducts used as animal feed, fertilizer, or compost inputs in new receiving markets
	•	Any pilot projects, modeling dashboards, or white papers evaluating comparative health outcomes between pre-tariff Chinese consumer cohorts and post-tariff receiving populations
