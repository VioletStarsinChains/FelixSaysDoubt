Request:

Requesting any and all records, laboratory analyses, contracts, communications, trade filings, certificates, modeling outputs, or investigative files concerning the production, sale, export, import, or downstream use of orange pulp (including pulp, pulp wash, dried citrus pulp, and citrus pulp pellets) associated with U.S. citrus processors and beverage companies—including The Coca-Cola Company and subsidiaries—from January 1, 2000 to present, with specific attention to shipments to the People’s Republic of China and subsequent environmental or agricultural uses.

This includes:
	•	Export, import, and transshipment records (including HS/HTS code references) for orange pulp/pulp derivatives; related Certificates of Analysis, MRL (maximum residue limit) compliance documents, and residue testing at ports of entry/exit
	•	Laboratory results and method reports for pesticide/fungicide residues (e.g., imazalil, thiabendazole, neonicotinoids, organophosphates), heavy metals (lead, arsenic, cadmium, mercury), mycotoxins, and Maillard byproducts (including acrylamide) in orange pulp and dried pulp products intended for export or feed/fertilizer use
	•	Records describing known or intended use pathways in receiving markets (e.g., livestock feed, soil amendment/compost incorporation, beverage or food reprocessing), including any environmental fate/persistence assessments and waste-stream management guidance
	•	Risk assessments, surveillance summaries, incident reports, or interagency memoranda regarding environmental dispersal of contaminants from orange pulp into soil, water, or animal systems, including microbiome impacts, reactive nitrogen cycling, and greenhouse gas implications
	•	Contracts, statements of work, deliverables, dashboards, or modeling outputs involving federal contractors (including Palantir Technologies, Accenture Federal Services, Deloitte, Booz Allen Hamilton) that analyze orange-pulp supply chains, residue profiles, destination mapping, or geofenced distribution analytics
	•	Records comparing U.S. and Chinese MRLs/regulatory thresholds, and any analyses assessing whether differential tolerances enable diversion of higher-residue pulp fractions to foreign markets
	•	Communications with The Coca-Cola Company (incl. Minute Maid, Simply brand entities) or citrus co-ops/packers regarding pulp fractionation, drying/thermal processing parameters, residue mitigation, or destination-specific formulations
	•	Any studies, white papers, or pilot projects evaluating intentional or strategic environmental testing using orange-pulp shipments (e.g., A/B regional routing, differential residue profiles) and associated behavioral/market modeling
	•	Records concerning monitoring or mitigation guidance provided to importers, feed operators, or agricultural users in China or other destination markets when U.S. orange pulp is used as feed or soil input

Keywords: orange pulp exports, citrus pulp pellets, pesticide residues, imazalil, heavy metals, acrylamide, livestock feed, soil amendment, geofenced distribution, behavioral modeling, Coca-Cola, China
