Request:

Requesting any and all records, inspection findings, vendor contracts, interagency communications, or research protocols from 2000 to present concerning the site-specific use or testing of GLP-1 receptor agonists, GLP-1–like peptides, or other appetite-regulating bioactives in the food supply chains of fast-food franchises, including but not limited to McDonald’s.

This includes:
	•	Records of pilot programs or research trials where GLP-1 analogues or metabolic regulators were introduced into food components (e.g., cooking oils, syrups, protein patties, bread products) at specific retail locations.
	•	Oversight documents or safety evaluations related to microencapsulation, stability, and delivery of GLP-1s in fast-food distribution systems.
	•	Communications between FDA, USDA, franchise headquarters, or contracted suppliers regarding localized product variation for research or quality assurance purposes.
	•	Inspection or compliance reports identifying differences in ingredient sourcing or formulation at specific franchise outlets compared to system-wide standards.
	•	Adverse event monitoring, consumer complaints, or field notes describing GLP-1–like side effects (nausea, rapid satiety, paradoxical weight loss) linked to fast-food products.
	•	Interagency correspondence (FDA, USDA, CDC, NIDA) regarding behavioral or metabolic studies conducted via franchise-based food distribution.
