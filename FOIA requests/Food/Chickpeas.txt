Request:

Requesting any and all documents, testing data, internal communications, or contractor reports from January 1, 2000 to present relating to heavy metal contamination in chickpeas (Cicer arietinum) and chickpea-derived food products sold in the United States.

This includes:
	•	Surveillance or testing results for cadmium, lead, arsenic, and mercury in domestic or imported chickpeas.
	•	Assessments of heavy metal accumulation in chickpea flours, protein isolates, or starches used in processed foods.
	•	Reports or memoranda concerning pre-harvest desiccant use (e.g., glyphosate) and subsequent contamination risks in chickpeas.
	•	Internal evaluations or correspondence regarding the use of chickpeas as substitutes for other grains/legumes in food products, and potential safety concerns tied to soil uptake of contaminants.
	•	Records of consumer safety advisories, recall considerations, or international trade disputes involving heavy metal contamination in chickpeas or chickpea products.

To: North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality / North Dakota Department of Agriculture

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, reports, communications, or contractor data from January 1, 2006 to present relating to contamination of agricultural soils or irrigation water in North Dakota croplands used for chickpea (Cicer arietinum) production, particularly in proximity to oil and gas extraction operations in the Bakken Formation.

This includes:
	•	Monitoring results for heavy metals (cadmium, lead, arsenic, barium, strontium, mercury) in soils or water used for crop production.
	•	Records of radionuclide contamination (e.g., radium-226/228) in agricultural areas near oil and gas wells, wastewater pipelines, or brine disposal sites.
	•	Incident reports, spill logs, or cleanup records related to produced water/brine releases affecting farmland where chickpeas are grown.
	•	Internal communications between ND DEQ, ND Department of Agriculture, USDA, or EPA regarding potential food safety risks of fracking-related contaminants entering chickpea or other pulse crops.
	•	Any risk assessments, advisories, or sampling protocols specifically addressing the co-location of pulse crop production and oil & gas development.

Keywords: chickpea, garbanzo, pulse crops, cadmium, lead, arsenic, barium, strontium, mercury, radium, produced water, brine spill, Bakken, soil contamination, irrigation water, NDDEQ, NDAg
