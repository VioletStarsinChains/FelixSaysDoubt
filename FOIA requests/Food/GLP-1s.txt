	•	Internal studies on feasibility of incorporating GLP-1 agonists into food, beverages, or dietary supplements
	•	Communications regarding behavioral or metabolic effects of product-level GLP-1 administration
	•	Reports or pilot projects concerning appetite suppression, weight modulation, or gastrointestinal motility impacts from fortified consumables
	•	Regulatory discussions regarding labeling, safety, or disclosure of GLP-1 additives
	•	Communications with industry stakeholders (including supplement companies, food manufacturers, or cannabis/kratom dispensaries) on covert or disclosed GLP-1 use in products
	•	Surveillance or adverse event reports concerning suspected GLP-1 contamination or fortification in consumables

Keywords: GLP-1 agonist, semaglutide, liraglutide, exenatide, dulaglutide, tirzepatide, food fortification, covert dosing, appetite suppression, gastric motility, behavioral modification, supplement additives

To: U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) / Office of Pest Management Policy and Agricultural Research Service

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, internal communications, or regulatory filings referencing the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists or related compounds in agricultural spraying, crop treatment, or livestock feed, from 2005 to present.

This includes:
	•	Research studies or pilot programs testing GLP-1 agonists as additives to pesticides, herbicides, or foliar sprays
	•	Communications with chemical manufacturers, crop spraying contractors, or agricultural equipment suppliers regarding GLP-1 integration
	•	Analyses of downstream effects of agricultural GLP-1 exposure on food supply or human consumers
	•	Regulatory or compliance discussions regarding disclosure, labeling, or monitoring of GLP-1 in agricultural contexts
	•	Reports of environmental, metabolic, or behavioral impacts observed in humans, livestock, or wildlife following crop-spraying applications

Keywords: GLP-1 agonist, semaglutide, liraglutide, exenatide, dulaglutide, tirzepatide, crop spraying, aerial application, pesticide additive, agricultural fortification, livestock feed, food chain exposure, appetite suppression

To: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) / Office of Pesticide Programs

Request:

This includes:
	•	Applications for registration or experimental use permits involving GLP-1 agonists as active or inert ingredients
	•	Risk assessments, toxicology reviews, or environmental impact statements considering GLP-1 compounds in agricultural spraying
	•	Communications with chemical manufacturers, crop-spraying contractors, or agricultural industry stakeholders about GLP-1 use in pesticide or spray mixtures
	•	Reports or investigations of potential downstream human exposure, ecological effects, or food-chain accumulation from aerial or ground-based spraying of GLP-1 compounds
	•	Cross-agency communications with USDA, FDA, or CDC regarding agricultural or public health implications of GLP-1 spraying
