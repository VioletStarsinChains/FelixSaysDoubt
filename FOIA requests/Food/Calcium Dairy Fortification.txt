Request:

Requesting any and all records, laboratory analyses, supplier certifications, interagency communications, or oversight reports from 1990 to present concerning the use of bone ash or other organic-derived materials in the calcium fortification of dairy products (including milk, yogurt, cheese, powdered milk, and infant formula) marketed or distributed in the United States.

This includes:
	•	FDA or USDA laboratory results identifying bone ash or non-standard calcium phosphate sources in fortified dairy products.
	•	Records of approved or rejected fortification agents for dairy, particularly those labeled as “recycled,” “eco-friendly,” or “organic-derived.”
	•	Supplier contracts and certifications regarding the sourcing of calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, or calcium lactate used in dairy fortification, including substitution of bone ash.
	•	Communications between FDA, USDA, or contractors concerning fortification standards in federally funded nutrition programs (school lunches, WIC, SNAP, hospital procurement).
	•	Records of consumer complaints, health hazard reports, or recalls tied to fortified dairy products later found to contain organic-derived materials.
