Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, contracts, surveillance data, or interagency communications from 2005 to present referencing Mondelēz International or Clif Bar & Company in the context of:
	•	Use of endurance sports nutrition products (including Clif Bar, Clif BLOKS, Clif SHOT Energy Gel, LUNA Bar, and Clif Builders Protein) to influence neurochemical states during or after sustained physical exertion
	•	Ingredient-level effects (including sugars, caffeine, amino acids, electrolytes, and emulsifiers) on dopamine, serotonin, or other neurotransmitter systems in relation to athletic performance
	•	AI or predictive analytics used to correlate sports nutrition intake with biometric or performance data from cycling, running, or triathlon events
	•	Trials or modeling of sports nutrition products as delivery vectors for cognitive or behavioral entrainment under conditions of physical fatigue
	•	Cross-sector collaborations with event organizers, wearable tech companies (e.g., Garmin, Strava), or defense-affiliated performance monitoring programs
	•	Analysis of performance recovery, decision-making speed, or psychological resilience in athletes with high exposure to Clif product lines
