Request:

Requesting any and all documents, laboratory reports, internal communications, import alerts, or interagency correspondence regarding the detection, monitoring, or risk assessment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis or related Mycobacterium species (e.g., M. avium, M. bovis) in imported or domestically processed food spices, from January 1, 2000 to present.

This includes:
	•	Surveillance data on microbial contamination of dried herbs and spices (domestic and international supply chains)
	•	Laboratory validation studies on survival of Mycobacterium spp. in dried or powdered food matrices
	•	Internal memoranda or white papers evaluating chronic low-dose exposure risks from contaminated spices
	•	Interagency correspondence with USDA, CDC, or CBP regarding potential entry vectors for Mycobacterium spp. through spice imports
	•	Reports of adverse event monitoring, consumer complaints, or case clusters linked to spice products and mycobacterial infection
	•	Contracts, grants, or cooperative research projects examining the role of dried foodstuffs in non-traditional transmission of tuberculosis or related pathogens
	•	Risk communication plans, industry guidance, or regulatory proposals addressing mitigation of mycobacterial contamination in spice supply chains

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, internal communications, research proposals, or interagency assessments regarding the potential for imported or domestically distributed culinary spices to act as vectors for microbial contamination or chronic colonization in U.S. populations, from January 1, 2000 to present.

This includes:
	•	Reports, memos, or studies on Mycobacterium tuberculosis or other persistent pathogens detected in spice supply chains
	•	Laboratory testing results on low-level microbial contaminants in cumin, turmeric, chili, peppercorns, cardamom, or other high-volume imported spices
	•	Risk assessment documents discussing disproportionate impacts of contaminated spices on immigrant or diaspora communities with higher consumption rates
	•	Analyses of chronic exposure pathways through spices incorporated into compost, soil, or food preparation environments
	•	Interagency communications on whether microbial contaminants in spices can contribute to latent infections, biofilm formation, or long-term inflammatory syndromes
	•	Any references to surveillance programs, sentinel studies, or pilot projects monitoring immigrant-heavy U.S. neighborhoods for microbial outcomes tied to spice consumption
