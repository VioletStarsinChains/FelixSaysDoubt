Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, laboratory analyses, internal communications, or interagency agreements concerning the use, detection, or impact of calcium-based additives, adulterants, or contaminants in imported or domestically processed spices, from January 1, 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Laboratory testing protocols and results regarding calcium carbonate, calcium silicate, calcium stearate, calcium sulfate, or related compounds in spice imports (turmeric, chili powder, curry blends, etc.)
	•	Internal or external reports on the role of calcium additives/adulterants in supporting or exacerbating granulomatous disease processes (tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, fungal nodules, etc.)
	•	Communications regarding public health risks in immigrant communities with high spice consumption, including differential exposure risks compared to the general U.S. population
	•	Interagency memoranda or cooperative studies between FDA, CDC, and international bodies on contamination, adulteration, or intentional modification of spices with calcium compounds
	•	Records on whether calcium additives in spices influence mast cell activation disorders, immune dysregulation, or microbiome balance
	•	Surveillance, recall, or enforcement actions related to calcium contamination or adulteration in imported spices

Keywords: calcium carbonate, calcium silicate, calcium stearate, calcium sulfate, spice adulteration, granuloma, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, immigrant health, FDA CFSAN, TB colonization

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, laboratory reports, internal communications, import alerts, or interagency correspondence regarding the detection, monitoring, or risk assessment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis or related Mycobacterium species (e.g., M. avium, M. bovis) in imported or domestically processed food spices, from January 1, 2000 to present.

This includes:
	•	Surveillance data on microbial contamination of dried herbs and spices (domestic and international supply chains)
	•	Laboratory validation studies on survival of Mycobacterium spp. in dried or powdered food matrices
	•	Internal memoranda or white papers evaluating chronic low-dose exposure risks from contaminated spices
	•	Interagency correspondence with USDA, CDC, or CBP regarding potential entry vectors for Mycobacterium spp. through spice imports
	•	Reports of adverse event monitoring, consumer complaints, or case clusters linked to spice products and mycobacterial infection
	•	Contracts, grants, or cooperative research projects examining the role of dried foodstuffs in non-traditional transmission of tuberculosis or related pathogens
	•	Risk communication plans, industry guidance, or regulatory proposals addressing mitigation of mycobacterial contamination in spice supply chains

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, internal communications, research proposals, or interagency assessments regarding the potential for imported or domestically distributed culinary spices to act as vectors for microbial contamination or chronic colonization in U.S. populations, from January 1, 2000 to present.

This includes:
	•	Reports, memos, or studies on Mycobacterium tuberculosis or other persistent pathogens detected in spice supply chains
	•	Laboratory testing results on low-level microbial contaminants in cumin, turmeric, chili, peppercorns, cardamom, or other high-volume imported spices
	•	Risk assessment documents discussing disproportionate impacts of contaminated spices on immigrant or diaspora communities with higher consumption rates
	•	Analyses of chronic exposure pathways through spices incorporated into compost, soil, or food preparation environments
	•	Interagency communications on whether microbial contaminants in spices can contribute to latent infections, biofilm formation, or long-term inflammatory syndromes
	•	Any references to surveillance programs, sentinel studies, or pilot projects monitoring immigrant-heavy U.S. neighborhoods for microbial outcomes tied to spice consumption

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, laboratory analyses, internal communications, or interagency agreements from January 1, 2000 to present concerning fungal contamination of imported or domestically processed spices and its potential interactions with mineral compounds (e.g., calcium salts) or acrylamide formation.

This includes:
	•	Records of fungal species identified in spice imports (e.g., pepper, turmeric, cinnamon) and their role in biofilm or granuloma formation
	•	Assessments of whether fungal colonization of mineralized tissue can be triggered or worsened by chronic dietary exposure to contaminated spices
	•	Documentation of how calcium additives, binders, or fortifiers in spices or spice blends affect fungal activity, granuloma stability, or biofilm persistence
	•	Reports on whether fungal colonization can influence neural or immune function through conductivity, ion channel manipulation, or mineral extraction
	•	Interagency communications on potential risks of spice contamination as a vector for long-term neurological or immunological dysregulation
	•	Contracts, cooperative research agreements, or grants involving FDA, USDA, or affiliated labs on fungal contamination, mineral additives, and food safety in neuroimmune health
