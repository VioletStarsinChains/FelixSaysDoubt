To FDA / Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, datasets, internal communications, consumer complaint summaries, adverse event reports (CAERS), compliance and labeling reviews, GRAS notices, toxicology assessments, and policy/guidance materials referencing synthetic wasabi products (e.g., horseradish/mustard-based “wasabi” pastes or powders with dyes/stabilizers) from 2010 to present.

This includes:
	•	Ingredient composition and additive usage in retail and foodservice “wasabi” products (horseradish, mustard flour, sorbitol, thickeners, sulfites, dyes including FD&C Yellow 5, FD&C Blue 1, and E141 copper chlorophyllin)
	•	Toxicology or exposure assessments for allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) and documented TRPA1-mediated symptom profiles (ocular/throat irritation, headache, asthma exacerbation)
	•	CAERS reports mentioning “wasabi,” “horseradish paste,” “mustard,” or the above color additives and sulfites; summaries of symptom clusters (urticaria, anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, behavioral hyperreactivity in children)
	•	Labeling and allergen compliance evaluations involving mustard as a declared or undeclared allergen in “wasabi” products
	•	Enforcement discretion, compliance actions, warning letters, recall records, or policy memos related to synthetic wasabi composition, labeling, or undeclared additives/allergens
	•	Any surveillance, market sampling, or retail studies quantifying prevalence of synthetic vs. real Wasabia japonica in commerce
	•	Interagency communications with ORA, NOAA, or CDC regarding adverse events or market prevalence of synthetic wasabi

Keywords: synthetic wasabi, horseradish powder, mustard flour, allyl isothiocyanate, sulfites, FD&C Yellow 5, FD&C Blue 1, E141 copper chlorophyllin, CAERS, adverse event, asthma, anaphylaxis

To FDA / Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) – Imports & Field Operations

Request:

Requesting any and all import examination records, laboratory analyses, sampling plans, Import Alerts/Detentions (including DWPE), refusal summaries, compliance communications, and internal guidance related to “wasabi” pastes/powders (including horseradish/mustard-based synthetic wasabi with dyes/stabilizers) from 2010 to present.

This includes:
	•	Entry-level data (product codes, HTS codes, manufacturer/shipper, country of origin), reasons for sampling/refusal, and laboratory findings (additives detected: sulfites, FD&C Yellow 5, FD&C Blue 1, E141; presence/level of AITC; undeclared mustard allergen)
	•	Import Alerts and field guidance referencing misbranding, undeclared allergens, undeclared color additives, or nonconforming synthetic compositions marketed as “wasabi”
	•	Laboratory methods/SOPs used for detecting isothiocyanates, sulfites, and FD&C/E141 dyes in wasabi-labeled products; method validation reports and detection limits
	•	Communications between ORA and CFSAN concerning adverse events, market surveillance outcomes, or coordinated enforcement actions related to synthetic wasabi
	•	Records of surveillance or blitz sampling at ports or domestic facilities targeting “wasabi” products, including outcome summaries and trend analyses
	•	Any traceback investigations or compliance follow-ups tied to consumer complaints or CAERS entries mentioning wasabi/horseradish/mustard paste
