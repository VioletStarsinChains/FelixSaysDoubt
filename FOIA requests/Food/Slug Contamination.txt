	•	Accidental contamination of the human food supply with snails or slugs, either whole or in processed/ground form
	•	Risks of parasite transmission (e.g., Angiostrongylus cantonensis / rat lungworm, liver flukes, schistosomes) via snail or slug fragments in foods
	•	Risk assessments related to allergenicity or toxin exposure from snail/slug contamination in processed grains, produce, or prepared foods
	•	USDA, FDA, or CDC discussions on food recalls or mitigation strategies linked to snail or slug contamination
	•	Communications or studies regarding bioaccumulation of heavy metals or pesticides in snails/slugs and subsequent transfer through contaminated food products

Request:

Requesting any and all reports, internal communications, research proposals, contracts, or memoranda from 2000 to present that reference:
	•	Use of snail or slug vectors (Angiostrongylus, liver flukes, schistosomes, or other gastropod-borne pathogens) in the modulation of human health or behavior
	•	Studies exploring whether exposure to gastropod-borne pathogens or proteins can cause neurological, cognitive, or connective tissue effects relevant to behavioral modeling or prediction
	•	Research into bioaccumulated toxins in snails/slugs as potential environmental levers for affecting human populations
	•	Deliberate or experimental contamination of agricultural supply chains with gastropod vectors for the purpose of stress-testing food safety systems or generating volatility in behavioral futures markets
	•	Interagency communications linking snail/slug contamination events with population-level monitoring of medical, psychological, or economic outcomes
