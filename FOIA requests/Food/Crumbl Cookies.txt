To FDA / Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) / Office of Food Additive Safety (OFAS) / CFSAN Adverse Event Reporting System (CAERS)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, GRAS notices, food additive petitions, internal communications, contracts, inspection records, sampling/lab reports, enforcement actions, and CAERS adverse event data referencing the use, testing, evaluation, or consideration of GLP-1 receptor agonists, incretin mimetics, or peptide-based appetite modulators as additives, processing aids, coatings, fillings, or frostings in commercial bakery products (including cookies), with specific interest in refrigerated or frozen dough supply chains and boutique/franchise dessert chains (including but not limited to Crumbl), from January 1, 2018 to present.

This includes:
	•	Stability, encapsulation, and survivability studies of peptide additives in doughs, batters, glazes, and frostings (cold-chain handling, bake-step degradation, post-bake application)
	•	Vendor/manufacturer communications, pilot program proposals, or procurement related to peptide or “incretin” ingredients for bakery products
	•	Field sampling assignments and analytical results (ORA/field labs) for peptide detection in bakery items and ingredients
	•	CAERS reports containing terms related to appetite suppression, early satiety, nausea, vomiting, gastroparesis, or unexplained weight loss associated with cookies/bakery products or named franchise dessert chains
	•	Inter- and intra-agency correspondence with FTC, CDC, or state partners regarding calorie labeling discrepancies or pharmacologically active compounds in bakery goods
	•	Compliance and enforcement records related to inaccurate calorie declarations or undisclosed bioactive additives in chain bakery products

Keywords: GLP-1, semaglutide, tirzepatide, incretin mimetic, peptide additive, refrigerated dough, frosting, CAERS, early satiety, gastroparesis, calorie labeling, franchise bakery, Crumbl

To FDA / Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) / Office of Criminal Investigations (OCI)

Request:

Requesting any and all inspection records, assignment memos, sampling plans, analytical reports, internal communications, referrals, and enforcement actions regarding potential use of GLP-1 receptor agonists, incretin mimetics, or other pharmacologically active peptides in commercial bakery products (including cookies) sold by national or regional franchise dessert chains (including but not limited to Crumbl), and any related investigations into inaccurate calorie disclosures, from January 1, 2018 to present.

This includes:

	•	Laboratory methods, validation records, and results for detection of GLP-1/incretin peptides in food matrices (doughs, frostings, fillings)
	•	Correspondence with CFSAN/OFAS, state food safety partners, or FTC regarding findings or suspected noncompliance
	•	Warning letters, regulatory meetings, seizure/injunction referrals, or criminal inquiries tied to undisclosed bioactives or deceptive calorie labeling in franchise bakery chains

Keywords: ORA sampling, OCI investigation, GLP-1, incretin, peptide detection, bakery enforcement, calorie fraud, refrigerated supply chain, franchise dessert chain, Crumbl, lab results

To Federal Trade Commission (FTC) / Bureau of Consumer Protection / Division of Advertising Practices

Request:

Requesting any and all consumer complaints, investigative files, internal communications, correspondence with the FDA or state AGs, closing memoranda, and settlement/consent documents concerning alleged inaccurate calorie or nutrition claims, or undisclosed pharmacologically active additives (including GLP-1/incretin-class peptides) in products sold by national or regional franchise dessert/bakery chains (including but not limited to Crumbl), from January 1, 2018 to present.

This includes:
	•	Tip-and-complaint intake referencing excessive calories, misdeclared calories, or paradoxical weight changes linked to cookie/bakery consumption
