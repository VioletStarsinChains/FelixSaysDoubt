To Food and Drug Administration (FDA) / Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, research proposals, vendor contracts, interagency communications, or oversight reports from 2000 to present concerning the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists or GLP-1 analogue compounds in the formulation of diet or weight-management foods, including but not limited to: protein-fortified snacks, sugar-free or reduced-calorie products, and nutritionally fortified “diet” meal replacements.

This includes:
	•	Internal studies or safety assessments on the effects of GLP-1 analogues in food matrices (bars, shakes, snacks).
	•	Correspondence with manufacturers regarding use of GLP-1 microdosing as an appetite suppressant in consumer packaged goods.
	•	Labeling reviews or regulatory deliberations concerning whether bioactive GLP-1 substances require disclosure as ingredients or additives.
	•	Supplier contracts or deliverables describing integration of GLP-1 or GLP-1-like peptides into fortified foods marketed for weight control.
	•	Reports on adverse event monitoring linked to diet foods suspected of producing GLP-1-like side effects (nausea, slowed digestion, unexplained appetite suppression).

Keywords: GLP-1 analogue, semaglutide, exenatide, liraglutide, dulaglutide, tirzepatide, diet food, protein bar, fortified snack, sugar-free product, CFSAN, appetite regulation

To Food and Drug Administration (FDA) / Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) / Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) / Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, research proposals, supplier contracts or certifications, inspection findings, laboratory analyses, adverse event summaries, enforcement actions, or interagency communications from 2000 to present concerning the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists (or GLP-1–like peptides) in foods marketed for weight management (e.g., protein bars/shakes, sugar-free or “diet” snacks, fortified meal replacements), including combinations intended to increase compulsive consumption (e.g., opioid peptides, excitotoxins, sweetener systems, mineral chelators, stimulants).

This includes:
	•	Internal studies, safety assessments, or method development regarding detection, stability, microencapsulation, or release of GLP-1 analogues in food matrices.
	•	Communications with manufacturers or contractors about GLP-1 microdosing in consumer packaged goods and any labeling/GRAS determinations or guidance related to such use.
	•	Records on combined or synergistic formulations that pair GLP-1 (or GLP-1–like activity) with:
	•	Opioid peptides (e.g., casein-derived casomorphins, gluten-derived gluteomorphins/gliadorphins);
	•	Excitotoxins or flavor enhancers (e.g., MSG, hydrolyzed proteins, aspartate blends);
	•	Artificial/novel sweeteners with rebound effects (e.g., sucralose, aspartame, acesulfame K, allulose systems);
	•	Mineral-binding additives/chelators (e.g., phosphates) that may alter electrolyte status;
	•	Mild stimulants (e.g., caffeine, theobromine).
	•	Oversight reviews, inspection reports, or enforcement actions addressing undeclared bioactive agents in diet/fortified foods, including sampling and analytical protocols for GLP-1 detection.
	•	Post-market surveillance, consumer complaint summaries, or signal detection documents referencing “GLP-1–like” or “Ozempic-like” effects (e.g., persistent nausea, delayed gastric emptying, unusual satiety) linked to diet foods.
	•	Interagency communications (e.g., with USDA, FTC) concerning marketing claims, labeling, or safety of diet foods employing behavior-modulating ingredient combinations.

Keywords: GLP-1 analogue, semaglutide, liraglutide, exenatide, tirzepatide, diet foods, protein bars, casomorphin, MSG, sucralose, hyperpalatable, phosphate additives, microencapsulation
