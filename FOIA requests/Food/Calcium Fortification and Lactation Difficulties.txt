Request:

Requesting any and all records, grant files, study protocols, data analyses, adverse event summaries, literature reviews, or internal communications concerning the relationship between dietary calcium fortification/supplementation and lactation outcomes and/or soft-tissue mineralization (including uterine fibroids and breast/ductal calcifications) from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Intramural and extramural research on calcium-fortified foods (e.g., milk, yogurt, formula) and maternal lactation outcomes (supply, ductal function, mastitis incidence, weaning)
	•	Studies examining breast tissue/ductal microcalcifications or soft-tissue mineralization in postpartum or lactating populations, including imaging and pathology correlations
	•	Research on uterine fibroids (leiomyomas) and calcium/phosphate metabolism in reproductive-age and postpartum cohorts
	•	Analyses of nutrient interactions affecting calcification risk (e.g., vitamin D, vitamin K2, magnesium, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone) and implications for lactation
	•	Program evaluations or communications referencing infant formula fortification standards and any observed associations with maternal breastfeeding success or lactation complications
	•	Systematic reviews, meta-analyses, risk assessments, or expert panels addressing calcium intake targets in pregnancy/lactation and potential unintended effects on soft tissues
	•	Correspondence with CDC, FDA, USDA (FNS/WIC), or academic contractors regarding calcium fortification policy and maternal/infant health outcomes

Keywords: calcium fortification, lactation insufficiency, breastfeeding outcomes, ductal calcification, breast microcalcifications, mastitis, uterine fibroids, leiomyoma, soft tissue mineralization, vitamin K2, magnesium deficiency, parathyroid hormone, infant formula, WIC
