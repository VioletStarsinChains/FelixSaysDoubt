To Food and Drug Administration (FDA) / National Institutes of Health (NIH) / National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, grant applications, research proposals, contractor reports, or interagency communications from 1990 to present concerning the evaluation of synthetic food dyes (including Yellow 5/Tartrazine, Yellow 6, Red 40, and Blue 1) as biomarkers, biological tracers, or biosurveillance tools.

This includes:
	•	Federally funded or contractor-led studies assessing whether these dyes can serve as population-level biomarkers through excretion patterns, fluorescence, or spectral signatures.
	•	Records of toxicology and pharmacokinetic reviews where dyes were evaluated not just for safety but for their utility in tracking metabolism, gut microbiome activity, or physiological response.
	•	Communications with corporations, research institutions, or other federal agencies (DARPA, DoD, CDC) concerning the dual-use applications of food dyes for both consumer products and surveillance research.
	•	Oversight reviews or ethical reports addressing whether synthetic dyes in widely consumed products (including sodas and energy drinks marketed to gamers/youth) were studied as biometric tracers.
	•	Reports of adverse events or consumer safety evaluations noting neurological, immunological, or behavioral impacts of synthetic dye consumption.
	•	Interagency correspondence between FDA, NIH, and NIEHS regarding the potential role of synthetic food dyes as surrogate markers in health surveillance, epidemiological studies, or experimental entrainment contexts.
