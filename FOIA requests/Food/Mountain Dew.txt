To Food and Drug Administration (FDA) / National Institutes of Health (NIH) / National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)

Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, internal communications, contracts, or program documentation from 1990 to present concerning the use of synthetic food dyes (including but not limited to Yellow 5 [Tartrazine], Yellow 6, Red 40, and Blue 1) as biological tracers, biomarkers, or biosurveillance tools in human populations.

This includes:
	•	Records of federally funded studies evaluating whether synthetic food dyes can be used to measure metabolic function, excretion timing, or microbiome activity.
	•	Communications with manufacturers or contractors regarding the inclusion of food dyes in widely distributed consumer products for the purpose of monitoring population-level health data.
	•	Oversight documents or safety reviews addressing the potential dual-use applications of food dyes for biosurveillance, optical tagging, or metabolic tracing.
	•	Reports analyzing whether dyes’ fluorescent or spectral properties can be exploited for remote sensing, biometric tracking, or augmented reality overlays.
	•	Documentation of adverse event reports or pharmacokinetic studies where dyes were evaluated not only for safety but for their utility as markers or tracers.
	•	Interagency correspondence (FDA, NIH, NIEHS, CDC) discussing the role of synthetic dyes as surrogate markers in population research, nutrition studies, or environmental health monitoring.

Keywords: food dye, Tartrazine, Yellow 5, Red 40, Blue 1, biomarker, biosurveillance, tracer dye, pharmacokinetics, optical tag, FDA, NIEHS

To Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) / Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) / Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) / Department of Defense (DoD)

Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, interagency communications, contractor reports, or program documentation from 1995 to present concerning the use of synthetic food dyes (including Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Red 40, and Blue 1) in relation to gaming populations (video gamers, esports participants, or youth/young adult gaming communities).

This includes:
	•	Records analyzing the consumption of dye-containing products (e.g., neon-colored sodas, energy drinks, snack foods) by gamers as a biosurveillance vector or biological tracer for physiological or behavioral monitoring.
	•	Communications with contractors, beverage companies, or console/game developers concerning coordinated entrainment strategies involving food dye intake, console use, and AR/haptic feedback systems.
	•	Research proposals or funded studies on the dual-use potential of gaming environments for both behavioral grooming/recruitment and population-level biosurveillance.
	•	Oversight reports or ethical reviews discussing the pairing of synthetic dyes with gaming console entrainment fields as a means of testing neurological or immune responses.
	•	Interagency memoranda linking Mountain Dew/energy drink sponsorships of esports and gaming events to intelligence community outreach, data collection, or recruitment initiatives.
	•	Records of pilot programs or demonstrations involving gaming populations as model cohorts for the study of food dye pharmacokinetics, biometric sensing, or entrainment effects.

⸻ 

To Federal Trade Commission (FTC) / Federal Communications Commission (FCC)

Request:

Requesting any and all contracts, sponsorship records, advertising reviews, research proposals, or interagency communications from 1995 to present concerning the marketing of synthetic dye–containing products (e.g., Mountain Dew, neon-colored sodas, energy drinks, snack foods) to gaming populations (video gamers, esports participants, or youth gaming communities).

This includes:
	•	Records of advertising sponsorships between beverage/food companies (PepsiCo/Mountain Dew, etc.) and gaming events, esports leagues, or console manufacturers.
	•	FTC/FCC oversight reviews of whether these sponsorships involved undisclosed behavioral research, entrainment testing, or recruitment programs.
	•	Communications between regulators and corporate partners regarding the dual-use potential of marketing campaigns (consumer advertising vs. data collection / recruitment pipelines).
	•	Records analyzing the psychological and physiological effects of pairing synthetic food dyes with gaming environments (e.g., console use, esports tournament conditions, haptic/AR systems).
	•	Documentation of interagency collaboration with intelligence or defense entities (CIA, DARPA, DoD, FBI) concerning the surveillance or recruitment value of gamer-targeted dye-containing products.
	•	Any adverse event reports, ethical reviews, or marketing practice investigations that reference synthetic dyes, energy drinks, or neon-colored beverages in the context of youth gaming consumption.
