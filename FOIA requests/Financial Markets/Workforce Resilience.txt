To: Department of Labor (DOL) / Department of Commerce (DOC) / Department of Homeland Security (DHS)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, reports, contracts, or interagency communications from 2019 to present concerning the use of synthetic population datasets, agent-based simulations, or digital twins for modeling workforce availability and supply chain resilience during the Covid-19 pandemic.

This includes:
	•	Records of synthetic workforce models used to project labor shortages, absenteeism, or critical infrastructure staffing gaps
	•	Contracts with universities, modeling firms, or contractors providing agent-based workforce simulations
	•	Reports integrating synthetic populations into analyses of supply chain stability, manufacturing output, or distribution networks
	•	Internal communications regarding the use of synthetic workforce data to supplement or adjust official economic and labor statistics

Keywords: synthetic population, agent-based modeling, digital twin, workforce availability, supply chain resilience, labor shortages, pandemic modeling, DHS, DOL, DOC

FOIA (Spicy Angle – Behavioral Futures in Workforce / Supply Chain)

To: Department of Defense (DoD) / Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) / Department of Homeland Security (DHS)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, contracts, communications, or internal analyses from 2019 to present concerning the use of synthetic population simulations or behavioral futures modeling for workforce and supply chain continuity during the Covid-19 pandemic.

This includes:
	•	Programs or reports using agent-based simulations to maintain the appearance of stable workforce participation despite elevated mortality or attrition
	•	Records describing integration of synthetic workforce or consumer populations into economic demand forecasts, logistics planning, or supply chain resilience exercises
	•	Communications with defense contractors, NGOs, or foreign partners regarding the substitution of synthetic population models for missing real-world labor force data
	•	Analyses linking synthetic population replacement to morale stabilization, consumer confidence, or continuity of public-facing economic indicators

Keywords: synthetic population, behavioral futures, workforce continuity, supply chain simulation, Covid-19, mortality concealment, agent-based simulation, demand forecasting, DARPA, DHS, DoD

FOIA (Labor Force Data Integrity Angle)

To: Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) / Department of Labor (DOL)

Request:
Requesting any and all documents, reports, contracts, or interagency communications from 2019 to present concerning the use of synthetic population datasets, digital twins, or agent-based simulations in the production of labor force participation data, unemployment statistics, or workforce availability projections during the Covid-19 pandemic.

This includes:
	•	Records describing adjustments to labor force participation or unemployment data using synthetic or modeled populations
	•	Contracts with universities, contractors, or modeling firms providing synthetic workforce datasets for use in BLS reports
	•	Internal memoranda or communications discussing integration of synthetic or agent-based models into official labor statistics
	•	Analyses of discrepancies between real-world workforce reporting and synthetic population projections during the Covid-19 era

Keywords: Bureau of Labor Statistics, synthetic population, labor force participation, unemployment data, workforce availability, digital twin, agent-based modeling, Covid-19, statistical adjustment, DOL
