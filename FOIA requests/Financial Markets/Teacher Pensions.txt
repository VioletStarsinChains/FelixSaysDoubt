To Minnesota State Board of Investment (SBI) / Teachers Retirement Association of Minnesota (TRA) / Minnesota Management & Budget (MMB)

Request:

Requesting any and all records from January 1, 2018 to present concerning the impact of COVID-19–related mortality among Minnesota K-12 and higher-ed educators on pension liabilities, funding status, and investment decisions for educator retirement plans overseen by SBI/TRA/MMB.

This includes:
	•	Actuarial experience studies, valuation reports, assumption memos, and board presentations addressing educator mortality (actual vs. expected), mortality improvement scales, and any post-COVID revisions to longevity assumptions.
	•	Scenario analyses, stress tests, or risk committee materials quantifying changes in benefit obligations attributable to COVID-19 mortality or excess deaths among active/retired teachers and staff.
	•	Internal emails, board minutes, and consultant reports (e.g., Gabriel Roeder Smith, Segal, Milliman, or equivalent) discussing COVID-related liability reductions, funding ratio effects, or contribution policy changes.
	•	Asset-allocation reviews, investment committee decks, and manager correspondence explaining any shifts in portfolio strategy (public/private markets, overlays, derivatives, longevity hedges) linked to updated mortality/liability projections.
	•	Reports on death benefits, survivor benefits, and forfeitures/forfeited accruals, including analyses of how these flows affected plan cash needs or investment pacing.
	•	Communications between SBI, TRA, MMB and external investment managers regarding use of mortality/longevity data in portfolio construction (e.g., annuities, LDI, longevity risk transfer, mortality-linked securities).
	•	Interagency correspondence with Minnesota Department of Education or Department of Health regarding educator mortality data used in pension modeling.
