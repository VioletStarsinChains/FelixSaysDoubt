To SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission)

Request:
Requesting any and all documents, reports, enforcement records, internal communications, or vendor partnerships from 2005 to present concerning the use of the subprime mortgage crisis as a framework for behavioral modeling or volatility forecasting in financial markets.

This includes:
	•	Internal analyses of the subprime crisis as a source of monetizable volatility
	•	Records of collaboration with vendors or contractors studying the crisis through the lens of predictive modeling, neuroeconomics, or behavioral futures
	•	Communications with academic or private sector partners regarding subprime consumer behavior datasets and their use in modeling compliance or default risk
	•	Reports on the role of housing instability, eviction, or foreclosure stress as inputs to behavioral prediction systems
	•	Records concerning the intentional use of financial crisis events to train models in synthetic market volatility management

Keywords:
subprime mortgage crisis, behavioral futures, monetizable volatility, predictive modeling, foreclosure stress, housing instability, compliance testing, financial crisis datasets

⸻

To HUD (Department of Housing and Urban Development)

Request:
Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, funding records, or internal communications from 2005 to present regarding the use of foreclosure, eviction, and housing instability data from the subprime mortgage crisis in federally sponsored behavioral or predictive modeling projects.

This includes:
	•	Reports on the use of housing instability data as a stress or compliance variable in behavioral research
	•	Cross-agency communications with SEC, DARPA, or NIH on using housing crisis populations as experimental cohorts
	•	Records of vendor contracts or data-sharing agreements involving subprime housing data for predictive analytics or neuroeconomic modeling
	•	Ethical reviews or adverse event reports tied to research involving evicted or foreclosed households

Keywords:
subprime foreclosure, housing instability, behavioral modeling, predictive analytics, compliance stressor, eviction data, federally funded research, neuroeconomics, monetizable volatility

⸻

To DARPA

Request:
Requesting any and all documents, contracts, research proposals, and internal communications from 2005 to present regarding the subprime mortgage crisis as a model for stress-induced decision-making and volatility exploitation.

This includes:
	•	Studies of the subprime crisis as a testbed for entrainment or compliance testing under economic duress
	•	Projects analyzing foreclosures, evictions, and defaults as inputs for behavioral futures simulations
	•	Vendor or university proposals to use financial crisis data as a behavioral dataset for defense/intelligence modeling
	•	Reports or internal memos discussing synthetic reproduction of crisis conditions for predictive market control
	•	Cross-agency communications with SEC, HUD, or NIH on the use of subprime datasets in neuroeconomic or behavioral prediction projects

Keywords:
subprime crisis modeling, monetizable volatility, neuroeconomics, behavioral futures, crisis simulation, economic entrainment, foreclosure stress, predictive defense modeling

To Federal Reserve Board of Governors

Request:
Requesting any and all documents, research reports, internal communications, meeting minutes, contractor or vendor agreements, and inter-agency correspondence from 2005 to present regarding the subprime mortgage crisis as a framework for behavioral modeling and volatility monetization.

This includes:
	•	Internal analyses of the subprime crisis as a stress dataset for modeling consumer decision-making under duress
	•	Research on the role of foreclosure, eviction, and credit default events as behavioral variables in predictive simulations
	•	Records describing the use of crisis data to generate or exploit synthetic volatility for market forecasting
	•	Correspondence with DARPA, SEC, HUD, or NIH regarding behavioral futures markets and crisis-based entrainment experiments
	•	Vendor contracts or academic partnerships studying neuroeconomic or psychometric responses to financial instability during and after the subprime collapse
	•	Reports considering the subprime mortgage crisis as a training event for resilience modeling, market manipulation prevention, or volatility monetization strategies

Keywords:
