Request:
Requesting any and all documents, funding records, contracts, internal communications, research proposals, or vendor partnerships from 2000 to present related to federally sponsored neuroeconomics projects.

	•	Experimental use of neuroeconomics in predictive modeling of consumer behavior or compliance testing
	•	Records of entrainment experiments where economic decision-making is influenced by neurotech, synthetic stimuli, or environmental manipulations
	•	Cross-agency communications regarding the use of neuroeconomics for policy design, housing stability, or social services allocation
	•	Data-sharing agreements with private vendors, contractors, or universities conducting neuroeconomics research with federal sponsorship or oversight
	•	Internal or ethical review documents addressing nonconsensual or vulnerable-population cohorts in neuroeconomic studies (e.g., mentally ill, unhoused, incarcerated)
	•	Reports on the application of neuroeconomics in futures markets, scenario modeling, or defense/intelligence simulations
