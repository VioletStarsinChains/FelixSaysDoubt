To Department of Defense (DoD) / Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)

Request:

Requesting any and all contracts, research proposals, memoranda of understanding, pilot program documentation, or interagency communications from 1995 to present concerning the use of video game consoles, console peripherals, or commercial game engines in military, intelligence, or defense-related applications.

This includes, but is not limited to:
	•	Records of research funded or conducted by DoD/DARPA exploring console hardware or software for training, recruitment, or simulation purposes.
	•	Studies on the use of motion capture, VR headsets, haptic devices, or depth sensors (e.g., Microsoft Kinect, PlayStation peripherals, Nintendo systems) in soldier training, biometric capture, or cognitive performance monitoring.
	•	Contracts or collaborations between DoD/DARPA and commercial console manufacturers (e.g., Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo) or academic institutes (e.g., USC Institute for Creative Technologies) regarding dual-use development of gaming technologies.
	•	Evaluations of console network platforms (e.g., Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, Nintendo Online) as environments for simulation, recruitment, social mapping, or behavioral analysis.
	•	Oversight documents or program reviews concerning the classification of gaming consoles and related technologies as dual-use systems with both consumer entertainment and defense applications.

Keywords: DARPA, DoD, video game console, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, Kinect, VR headset, haptics, game engine, Institute for Creative Technologies, dual-use, soldier training, biometric capture, recruitment simulation

To Federal Trade Commission (FTC) / Federal Communications Commission (FCC) / Food and Drug Administration (FDA) / Department of Defense (DoD) / DARPA

Request:

Requesting any and all records, research proposals, vendor contracts, internal communications, or regulatory assessments from 2000 to present regarding the use of gaming consoles or associated peripherals (e.g., controllers, VR headsets, motion sensors, haptic devices, audio hardware) as entrainment or neuromodulation devices.

This includes:
	•	Internal studies on the potential for gaming consoles to deliver entrainment signals (visual flicker, auditory beats, haptic feedback, EMF emission) with effects on cognition, mood, attention, or behavior.
	•	Records of government-funded research or pilot programs evaluating gaming consoles as vectors for behavioral conditioning, neurocognitive entrainment, or health monitoring.
	•	Contracts or communications with console manufacturers (e.g., Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo) regarding signal delivery capabilities, telemetry collection, or firmware updates with neuromodulatory potential.
	•	Oversight documents concerning consumer exposure risks tied to prolonged use of consoles or VR headsets, including reports of adverse effects (dissociation, seizures, autonomic instability).
	•	Any regulatory deliberations or interagency correspondence on whether consoles fall under medical device, consumer electronics, or dual-use technology classifications when deployed in entrainment contexts.

Keywords: gaming console, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, VR headset, haptic controller, neuromodulation, entrainment, EMF emission, DARPA, behavioral conditioning, continuity operations
