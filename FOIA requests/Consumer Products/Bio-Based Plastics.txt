Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, laboratory analyses, interagency communications, or oversight reports from 1990 to present concerning the use of organic-derived materials, cremated remains, bone ash, keratin, or other human/animal remains in the production of plastics, elastomers, or consumer accessories such as hair ties, rubber bands, or plastic clips.

This includes:
	•	Safety testing or compositional analyses identifying bone ash, cremains, or human/animal remains used as fillers, pigments, or stabilizers in plastics or elastomers.
	•	Import inspection reports on bio-based plastics or “recycled polymer” products that incorporated organic remains.
	•	Records discussing the use of keratin-based polymers derived from human or animal hair in hair ties, elastics, or accessory products.
	•	Consumer complaints, adverse health reports, or recalls linked to accessories or plastics found to contain organic remains or keratin-derived biopolymers.
	•	Interagency or contractor communications on the potential substitution of organic-derived fillers for conventional polymer additives in mass-produced consumer goods.
