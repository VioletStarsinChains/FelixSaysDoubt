Request:

Requesting any and all records, reports, research proposals, contracts, or internal communications from 2000 to present concerning the testing or evaluation of glass smoking paraphernalia (including cannabis pipes, bongs, and water pipes) for the presence of nanoparticle additives, engineered materials, or embedded sensors.

This includes:
	•	Testing or studies on the inclusion of nanodiamonds, nitrogen-vacancy centers, or other engineered carbon-based nanomaterials in glass formulations used for smoking devices.
	•	Records concerning the incorporation of metallic nanoparticles, quantum dots, silicates, or nanocoatings into consumer glassware marketed as smoking accessories.
	•	Reports or deliverables discussing whether repeated heating, combustion, or airflow through these devices could cause release or entrainment of nanoparticles into inhaled smoke or vapor.
	•	Internal communications or interagency correspondence regarding the potential for glass smoking devices to serve as biometric sensors, entrainment vectors, or data-collection platforms under the guise of consumer products.
	•	Contracts, grants, or deliverables from private vendors, universities, or research labs addressing toxicology, safety, or surveillance applications of nanoparticle-doped glass.

Keywords: glass smoking pipe, cannabis paraphernalia, nanodiamonds, nitrogen vacancy centers, NV centers, nanomaterials in glass, quantum dot glass, nanoparticle inhalation, consumer product adulteration, embedded sensor glass
