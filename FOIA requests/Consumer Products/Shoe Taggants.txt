To Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) / Food and Drug Administration (Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition; Office of Cosmetics and Colors) / Environmental Protection Agency (Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, regulatory filings, toxicological studies, laboratory analyses, enforcement actions, consumer complaints, or interagency communications from 1995 to present concerning the inclusion of taggants, tracers, or covert identifiers in foamed footwear products (including but not limited to Crocs and other EVA/PU/PVC foam shoes).

This includes:
	•	Records of nanoparticle, isotopic, fluorescent, or polymeric taggants used as additives in foamed footwear products marketed to U.S. consumers
	•	CPSC and FDA safety evaluations or risk assessments regarding dermal absorption, inhalation, or systemic toxicity of such additives in footwear
	•	EPA filings or guidance on manufacturing effluents or environmental release of taggant-bearing footwear polymers
	•	Internal communications or consumer complaints regarding undisclosed additives in Crocs or similar foamed footwear
	•	Interagency memoranda evaluating whether footwear taggants fall under disclosure, labeling, or consumer right-to-know requirements

Keywords: Crocs, foamed footwear, EVA foam, polyurethane foam, PVC foam, footwear taggants, nanoparticle tracers, isotopic markers, fluorescent pigments, CPSC footwear safety, FDA consumer products, EPA chemical safety

FOIA 2 — Forensic / Surveillance Angle (Foamed Footwear, e.g. Crocs)

To FBI (Laboratory Division; Operational Technology Division; Behavioral Analysis Unit) / U.S. Department of Justice (National Institute of Justice; Office of Justice Programs) / Department of Homeland Security (Science & Technology Directorate)

Request:

Requesting any and all contracts, research proposals, forensic validation studies, laboratory protocols, technical reports, interagency memoranda, and internal communications from 1995 to present concerning the use of taggants, tracers, or covert identifiers embedded in foamed footwear products (including but not limited to Crocs and other EVA/PU/PVC foam shoes) for purposes of forensic trace evidence, surveillance, or mobility telemetry.

This includes:
	•	FBI Laboratory or NIJ studies on the use of tagged footwear polymers as forensic identifiers in trace evidence analysis (e.g., unique footprint signatures, isotopic/fluorescent markers)
	•	OTD briefs or DHS S&T program files describing the use of foamed footwear taggants in behavioral telemetry, crowd monitoring, or mobility simulations
	•	Vendor contracts or cooperative agreements with manufacturers of Crocs or similar foamed footwear regarding embedded tracers or identifiers
	•	Interagency communications on the use of footwear taggants to align vehicle/person simulations with real-world observations, including prevention of duplicate reference entities in modeling datasets
	•	DOJ or NIJ memoranda on admissibility, disclosure, and legal considerations related to footwear taggant evidence in investigations or prosecutions

Keywords: footwear taggants, Crocs, EVA foam tracers, forensic trace evidence, isotopic identifiers, fluorescent markers, DHS mobility telemetry, FBI Laboratory, NIJ research, behavioral telemetry

FOIA — Algae-Based Taggants

To FBI (Laboratory Division; Operational Technology Division; National Institute of Justice) / Department of Homeland Security (Science & Technology Directorate) / Environmental Protection Agency (Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention) / Food and Drug Administration (Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition; Office of Cosmetics and Colors)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, grant proposals, research reports, laboratory analyses, toxicological assessments, forensic validation studies, internal communications, and interagency memoranda from 1990 to present regarding the development, testing, regulation, or deployment of algae-based taggants, tracers, or covert identifiers for use in consumer products, forensic science, or surveillance programs.

This includes:
	•	Records describing the design or production of microalgae, engineered algae, or algal pigments as unique biological or spectral identifiers
	•	Laboratory methods or validation studies on the detection of algae-based taggants in trace evidence, environmental samples, or consumer goods
	•	FDA or EPA evaluations of toxicology, dermal absorption, inhalation, or ingestion risks associated with algae-derived taggant compounds in food, cosmetics, or consumer products
	•	DHS or FBI briefs on algae-based taggants as tracking markers, mobility telemetry agents, or forensic trace identifiers
	•	Vendor contracts or cooperative agreements for the supply of engineered algae or algal pigments as taggant materials
	•	Interagency communications on the integration of algae-based taggants with predictive modeling, behavioral telemetry, or compliance testing systems

Keywords: algae-based taggants, algal tracers, microalgae identifiers, biogenic taggants, fluorescent pigments, forensic trace evidence, DHS S&T, FBI Laboratory, EPA toxicology, FDA cosmetics
