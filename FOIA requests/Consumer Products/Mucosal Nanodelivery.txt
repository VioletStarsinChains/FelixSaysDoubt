To FDA / DARPA / Department of Defense

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, regulatory filings, internal communications, or vendor partnerships referencing the development, testing, or deployment of mucosal nanodelivery systems capable of introducing micro- or nanoscale biomedical devices, sensors, or materials through sexual wellness or gynecological products, from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Internal studies on nanomaterial absorption and retention in vaginal or cervical tissue
	•	Research into nanosensors or biointerfaces introduced through lubricants, gels, or barrier contraceptives
	•	Regulatory submissions or exemptions related to mucosal nanodelivery devices
	•	Military or dual-use studies on covert biomedical delivery via intimate or reproductive health products
	•	Adverse event reports involving unexplained neuropathic pain or inflammatory response in mucosal tissue
	•	Contracts with private vendors supplying or testing “smart” or “connected” sexual wellness technologies
