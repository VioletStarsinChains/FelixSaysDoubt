I believe some or all of these topics intersect with real-world experimental programs—possibly privatized, gamified, or obfuscated through NGOs, NFTs, or contractor systems.

I believe they are collecting massive amounts of data on human subjects without their knowledge for the purpose of training AIs, plus the enormous financial incentive provided by behavioral futures markets, which I believe are the true point of NFTs.  NFTs really dont make any sense without this interpretation, in my opinion.

Feel free to file and publish whatever comes back. Even rejection letters are useful.

If you’re a journalist, you have my blessing to investigate. I’m just a suspicious test subject with good pattern recognition and a mysterious informant.

My name is Kellyn Clay.  My X account is @FelixSaysDoubt.  My Youtube is @DetectiveWiggles.  My email is keclay@gmail.com.  I live in Minneapolis.  I am being forcibly kept homeless despite having money and a job.  I can't receive mail anywhere as it's always mysteriously blocked, even at a PO box or homeless shelter.  This has been going on for four years now.  I'm just trying to understand why.
