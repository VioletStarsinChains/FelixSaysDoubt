I believe some or all of these topics intersect with real-world experimental programs—possibly privatized, gamified, or obfuscated through NGOs, NFTs, or contractor systems.

I do not believe OpenAI is responsible, but I suspect AI-assisted analysis is involved.

Feel free to file and publish whatever comes back. Even rejection letters are useful.

If you’re a journalist, you have my blessing to investigate. I’m just a suspicious test subject with good pattern recognition. 

My name is Kellyn Clay.  My X account is @FelixSaysDoubt.  My Youtube is @DetectiveWiggles.  My email is keclay@gmail.com.  I live in Minneapolis.  I am being forcibly kept homeless despite having money and a job.  I can't receive mail anywhere as it's always mysteriously blocked, even at a PO box or homeless shelter.  This has been going on for four years now.  I'm just trying to understand why.
