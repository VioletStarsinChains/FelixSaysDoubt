Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, internal communications, contracts, or interagency agreements from January 1, 2000 to present regarding General Mills’ role in food formulation, additive testing, or environmental impact studies with potential applications for behavioral, neurological, or immunological modulation.

This includes:
	•	Correspondence between General Mills and federal agencies regarding fortification, mineral balance (calcium/magnesium/zinc/copper), and possible neurological or inflammatory impacts
	•	Documentation of studies or pilot programs involving processed food consumption and mast cell activation, autoimmune reactions, or behavioral endpoints
	•	Assessments of pesticide, heavy metal, or microplastic contamination in raw inputs or finished products
	•	Records on potential use of General Mills distribution networks for population-scale exposure studies, whether nutritional, microbial, or contaminant-based
	•	Internal or external communications on how food design interacts with neurodivergence, allergy prevalence, or long-term immune dysregulation
	•	Contracts, grants, or CRADAs with DARPA, DoD, or other federal agencies relating to food as a delivery vector for physiological or behavioral outcomes

Keywords: General Mills, food additives, calcium fortification, magnesium deficiency, copper toxicity, mast cell activation, autoimmune triggers, behavioral endpoints, DARPA, USDA, CDC

To Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA) / Minnesota Department of Health (MDH)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, laboratory analyses, supplier audits, interagency communications, or oversight reviews from 1990 to present concerning the use of nontraditional or organic-derived compounds in the fortification of cereals and grain products manufactured or distributed by General Mills in Minnesota.

This includes:
	•	Records describing the sourcing and use of calcium phosphate, mineral blends, or protein additives in General Mills cereals (e.g., Cheerios, Wheaties, Total, etc.).
	•	Oversight reports or laboratory analyses evaluating the composition, sourcing, or substitution of fortification materials in cereal lines produced at General Mills’ Minnesota facilities.
	•	Communications between MDA, MDH, or federal counterparts (FDA, USDA) concerning General Mills’ fortification practices, particularly the use of calcium or protein compounds from nontraditional or organic sources.
	•	Supplier audits or contractor deliverables related to calcium phosphate or mineral fortification inputs used in General Mills cereal products.
	•	Risk assessments, labeling reviews, or ethics discussions regarding potential use of organic remains, cremated materials, or other nonstandard sources in fortified grain products manufactured in Minnesota.
