Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, internal communications, contracts, or interagency agreements from January 1, 2000 to present regarding General Mills’ role in food formulation, additive testing, or environmental impact studies with potential applications for behavioral, neurological, or immunological modulation.

This includes:
	•	Correspondence between General Mills and federal agencies regarding fortification, mineral balance (calcium/magnesium/zinc/copper), and possible neurological or inflammatory impacts
	•	Documentation of studies or pilot programs involving processed food consumption and mast cell activation, autoimmune reactions, or behavioral endpoints
	•	Assessments of pesticide, heavy metal, or microplastic contamination in raw inputs or finished products
	•	Records on potential use of General Mills distribution networks for population-scale exposure studies, whether nutritional, microbial, or contaminant-based
	•	Internal or external communications on how food design interacts with neurodivergence, allergy prevalence, or long-term immune dysregulation
	•	Contracts, grants, or CRADAs with DARPA, DoD, or other federal agencies relating to food as a delivery vector for physiological or behavioral outcomes

Keywords: General Mills, food additives, calcium fortification, magnesium deficiency, copper toxicity, mast cell activation, autoimmune triggers, behavioral endpoints, DARPA, USDA, CDC
