To U.S. Department of Commerce (NIST) / Federal Trade Commission (Bureau of Consumer Protection) / Department of Justice (Antitrust Division; Civil Division, Consumer Protection Branch)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, research proposals, internal communications, technical evaluations, consumer complaints, and interagency memoranda concerning Apple Inc.’s development, testing, or deployment of technologies intended to induce or mediate synthetic hallucinations, synthetic experiences, or altered perceptual states in users, from 2005 to present.

This includes:
	•	Internal and external studies on augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR), and immersive media as methods of perceptual entrainment or behavioral influence
	•	Development of psychoacoustic compression, auditory augmented reality, and visual field manipulation in Apple devices (iPhone, AirPods, Vision Pro, etc.)
	•	Records of contracts or research collaborations with DARPA, IARPA, or DoD concerning synthetic experience induction for training, behavioral modeling, or compliance testing
	•	Consumer complaints or reports related to phantom vibrations, phantom sounds, or perceptual anomalies associated with Apple devices, and subsequent internal evaluations
	•	Documents regarding “reality distortion” effects as explicitly designed or emergent features of Apple products
	•	Safety and ethics reviews discussing risk of hallucination induction, derealization, or perceptual distortion through Apple software or hardware platforms
	•	Interagency communications linking Apple immersive technology to predictive modeling, behavioral futures markets, or neurocognitive telemetry collection

Keywords: Apple, synthetic hallucinations, synthetic experiences, augmented reality, psychoacoustic compression, auditory augmented reality, phantom vibration, reality distortion, perceptual entrainment, behavioral telemetry

To DARPA / IARPA / DoD (Office of Net Assessment, JPEO-CBRND) / DHS S&T Directorate / HHS (BARDA) / ODNI (Office of Science & Technology Intelligence)

Request:

Requesting any and all contracts, grants, research proposals, technical reports, program evaluations, internal communications, and interagency memoranda concerning collaborations, pilot programs, or funded research involving Apple Inc. (or its subsidiaries/contractors) in relation to synthetic hallucinations, synthetic experiences, or engineered perceptual states, from 2005 to present.

This includes:
	•	DARPA or IARPA program records describing Apple devices (iPhone, AirPods, Vision Pro, etc.) as platforms for augmented reality, auditory augmented reality, psychoacoustic compression, or visual entrainment experiments
	•	Technical deliverables or milestone reports from SBIR/STTR or CRADA agreements linking Apple or its vendors to neurocognitive manipulation, synthetic perception, or behavioral modeling programs
	•	Communications between DARPA/IARPA program managers and Apple regarding human subjects testing, ethics/IRB approvals, or perceptual safety assessments
	•	Documentation of behavioral telemetry capture or analysis derived from synthetic hallucination induction on Apple devices
	•	Interagency briefings linking Apple collaborations to predictive modeling, behavioral futures markets, compliance monitoring, or cognitive warfare concepts
	•	Risk/benefit analyses discussing civilian exposure to synthetic experience induction versus controlled deployment for training, resilience testing, or psyops applications

Keywords: Apple, DARPA, IARPA, synthetic hallucinations, synthetic experiences, augmented reality, auditory augmented reality, psychoacoustic compression, behavioral telemetry, cognitive warfare, perceptual entrainment
