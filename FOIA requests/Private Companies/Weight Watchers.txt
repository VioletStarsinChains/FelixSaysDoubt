To FTC / HHS / DOJ / NARA (Federal Trade Commission, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Justice, National Archives and Records Administration)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, internal communications, research contracts, oversight reports, or program files concerning Weight Watchers (now WW International, Inc.) as a compliance modeling apparatus between 1960 and present.

This includes:
	•	Records analyzing Weight Watchers’ point-based system as a behavioral conditioning or compliance framework
	•	Federal or contractor research into group weigh-ins, accountability sessions, or reward/punishment structures as data sources for behavioral telemetry
	•	Oversight or correspondence regarding partnerships between Weight Watchers and federal health, nutrition, or defense agencies for compliance modeling or predictive analytics
	•	Studies or internal evaluations describing Weight Watchers as a template for scalable behavior-change platforms later replicated in digital diet/exercise apps
	•	Interagency communications regarding commercialization of compliance models derived from Weight Watchers into corporate wellness programs, insurance compliance frameworks, or behavioral futures markets
	•	Historical audits or reports quantifying Weight Watchers’ role in shaping patient adherence models or population-level data collection on food intake, self-surveillance, and conformity

Keywords: Weight Watchers, WW International, compliance modeling, behavioral conditioning, self-surveillance, adherence models, point system, consumer telemetry, behavioral futures, corporate wellness

To FTC / HHS / DOJ / NARA

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, interagency communications, contractor reports, or program files concerning Weight Watchers (now WW International, Inc.) as a prototype compliance modeling system and precursor to behavioral futures markets, from 1960 to present.

This includes:
	•	Analyses of the Weight Watchers point system as an early form of compliance currency, conditioning participants to equate adherence with numerical scoring
	•	Records describing group weigh-ins and accountability meetings as structured experiments in self-surveillance, public shaming, and conformity testing
	•	Oversight or contractor reports linking Weight Watchers methodology to later corporate wellness programs, insurance compliance frameworks, and digital diet/exercise tracking platforms
	•	Interagency or academic communications describing Weight Watchers as a behavioral futures market template, where population-level food intake and lifestyle choices were commoditized as predictive data
	•	Historical investigations into whether Weight Watchers provided household-level or aggregate compliance data to federal agencies, defense contractors, or insurance partners
	•	Research exploring the continuity between Weight Watchers’ analog compliance regime and modern biometric apps, wearables, and social media “self-tracking” platforms

Keywords: Weight Watchers, WW International, compliance modeling, behavioral futures, self-surveillance, point system, adherence currency, conformity testing, corporate wellness, predictive data markets

To FTC / HHS / DOJ / NARA

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, interagency communications, contractor reports, or program files concerning Noom, Inc. as a behavioral compliance modeling platform and data-collection apparatus, from 2010 to present.

This includes:
	•	Records describing Noom’s color-coded food system and daily check-ins as digital compliance conditioning mechanisms
	•	Oversight or contractor reports linking Noom’s design to prior behavioral frameworks (e.g., Weight Watchers point system)
	•	Analyses of Noom’s group coaching model and push-notification structure as digital replications of in-person accountability meetings
	•	Interagency communications or research describing Noom as a behavioral telemetry system generating large-scale population data on food intake, weight fluctuations, and psychological compliance responses
	•	Contracts or partnerships between Noom and government agencies, insurers, or defense contractors for use of its compliance data in predictive modeling
	•	Evaluations or internal reports describing the integration of Noom’s behavioral data with corporate wellness, insurance risk assessment, or digital health surveillance platforms

Keywords: Noom, compliance modeling, behavioral telemetry, self-surveillance, food tracking, weight management, predictive analytics, corporate wellness, insurance compliance, behavioral futures

To FTC / HHS / DOJ / NARA

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, internal communications, interagency reports, contractor records, or program files concerning the evolution of compliance modeling systems from analog diet programs to digital biometric platforms, specifically Weight Watchers (WW International), Noom, Fitbit, and Apple Health, from 1960 to present.

This includes:
	•	Records analyzing Weight Watchers’ point system and group weigh-ins as foundational compliance conditioning frameworks
	•	Reports describing Noom’s digital coaching, food-color coding, and push-notification system as direct digital descendants of Weight Watchers accountability structures
	•	Oversight or contractor communications regarding Fitbit’s biometric self-tracking and Apple Health’s data integration as large-scale compliance telemetry systems
	•	Documentation explicitly linking diet/exercise self-reporting programs to behavioral futures markets, predictive analytics, or insurance compliance scoring
	•	Interagency communications or contracts between government agencies, insurers, or defense contractors and any of the above platforms regarding use of participant data for compliance modeling or predictive behavior studies
	•	Research reports or retrospective analyses describing the continuity between mid-century diet clubs, 2000s digital health apps, and contemporary biometric surveillance ecosystems

Keywords: Weight Watchers, WW International, Noom, Fitbit, Apple Health, compliance modeling, behavioral telemetry, predictive analytics, self-surveillance, corporate wellness, behavioral futures
