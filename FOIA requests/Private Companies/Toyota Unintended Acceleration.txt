To Department of Transportation / National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) / Federal Trade Commission (FTC) / Department of Justice (DOJ Antitrust Division) / Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)

Request:

Requesting any and all reports, contracts, communications, or internal analyses from January 1, 2005 to present regarding the use of Toyota “unintended acceleration” incidents as data sources for behavioral modeling, compliance testing, or behavioral futures markets applications.

This includes:
	•	NHTSA technical reports or contractor deliverables describing driver behavior, compliance rates, or decision-making under unintended acceleration scenarios
	•	Communications with DOJ or SEC about the effect of unintended acceleration incidents on stock price, credit markets, or consumer trust, and whether such data were monetized or modeled as predictive signals
	•	Records of interagency or academic partnerships analyzing “panic events,” “compliance anchors,” or “consumer resilience” during Toyota recalls
	•	Internal memos or white papers on applying unintended acceleration datasets to predictive modeling, behavioral economics, or futures pricing
	•	Enforcement files or consumer complaints coded for analysis of driver panic response, delayed reporting, or litigation tendencies

Keywords: unintended acceleration, Toyota recall, behavioral modeling, compliance anchor, panic response, futures markets, consumer trust modeling, NHTSA, SEC, litigation analytics, predictive markets

To Department of Defense / Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) / Department of Homeland Security (DHS S&T) / Transportation Security Administration (TSA) / Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, research proposals, or communications from January 1, 2005 to present referencing automobile unintended acceleration incidents (Toyota and comparable cases) in the context of stress inoculation, compliance testing, predictive modeling, or simulation of entrainment scenarios for military or homeland security applications.

This includes:
	•	Research proposals or pilot projects describing automobiles as simulated uncontrollable environments for measuring resilience, compliance, or panic thresholds
	•	Contracts or interagency communications on the applicability of unintended acceleration scenarios to aviation, mass transit, or critical infrastructure safety drills
	•	Reports or slide decks linking vehicle panic incidents to population-level resilience metrics or behavioral futures commodities
	•	Contractor analyses or behavioral economics studies repurposing Toyota case data for simulation of compliance anchors in transportation systems
	•	Interagency communications involving DARPA, DHS, or FAA on adapting civilian panic events to operational readiness research

Keywords: unintended acceleration, Toyota, behavioral futures, compliance testing, DARPA resilience, DHS stress inoculation, panic modeling, driver entrainment, transportation simulation, predictive analytics

To Department of Justice (Civil Division / Antitrust Division) / Federal Trade Commission (FTC) / Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) / Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC) / Federal Judicial Center (FJC)

Request:

Requesting any and all contracts, internal memoranda, briefing papers, interagency communications, statistical reports, or research proposals from January 1, 2009 to present concerning the use of Toyota “unintended acceleration” litigation datasets (civil, criminal, class action, and regulatory settlements) for behavioral modeling, compliance analytics, or behavioral futures markets.

This includes:
	•	DOJ or FTC communications about mining court records, discovery documents, or settlement data to analyze consumer complaint patterns, litigation tendencies, or compliance anchors
	•	Reports or databases segmenting plaintiffs by demographic, geographic, or socioeconomic factors in order to forecast propensity to sue, settle, or drop claims
	•	Research contracts or pilot studies describing Toyota case files as reference material for predictive modeling of consumer trust, risk tolerance, or panic behavior
	•	SEC or AOUSC communications evaluating Toyota litigation outcomes as signals for market behavior forecasting or as datasets for training predictive analytics systems
	•	Internal analyses framing litigation around Toyota unintended acceleration as a stress inoculation / mass compliance rehearsal comparable to a “witch trial” or hysteria event in legal and behavioral terms

Keywords: unintended acceleration, Toyota litigation, class action analytics, compliance anchor, behavioral futures, predictive modeling, DOJ discovery data, FTC consumer complaints, SEC market signals, AOUSC litigation database, stress inoculation
