Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, internal communications, regulatory filings, or interagency agreements referencing Warby Parker and/or its subsidiaries in relation to the development, testing, or deployment of eyewear containing embedded sensors, optical hardware, or digital health monitoring technology, from January 1, 2010 to present.

This includes:
	•	Correspondence between Warby Parker and federal agencies regarding the integration of sensors, microelectronics, or augmented/virtual reality features into eyewear products.
	•	Documentation of experiments or pilot programs involving eyewear used for physiological or behavioral monitoring, including ocular biometrics, pupillometry, or neurotechnology-linked interfaces.
	•	Reports or assessments on consumer health risks associated with eyewear incorporating cameras, wireless modules, or other data-extracting components.
	•	Internal or external communications on the role of eyewear in continuous monitoring, biometric identification, or geofencing applications.
	•	Contracts, grants, or cooperative research and development agreements (CRADAs) involving Warby Parker and agencies such as DARPA, IARPA, NIH, or DoD medical branches.
	•	Records on export controls, foreign partnerships, or technology transfer related to “smart glasses,” eye-tracking, or embedded sensor-enabled eyewear.
