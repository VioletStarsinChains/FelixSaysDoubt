To Department of Transportation / National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) / Federal Trade Commission (FTC)

Request:

Requesting any and all contracts, internal memoranda, technical evaluations, safety assessments, or consumer protection reviews from January 1, 2018 to present concerning the use of augmented reality (AR), mixed reality, or perceptual overlay technologies in commercial automobiles marketed or sold to U.S. consumers.

This includes:
	•	Technical documentation or correspondence on vehicles where exterior visual appearance may be digitally modified or projected through AR systems
	•	Safety or compliance assessments of driver-assist or navigation systems that incorporate perceptual overlays for the driver, passengers, or outside observers
	•	Communications with automakers regarding the consumer disclosure, marketing, or branding implications of AR-based vehicle visualization
	•	Any reports, complaints, or investigations regarding mismatches between physical vehicle specifications and their perceived or projected visual appearance
	•	Interagency discussions between DOT, FTC, or other agencies regarding consumer protection, misrepresentation, or behavioral effects of AR in automotive products

Keywords: augmented reality, perceptual overlay, mixed reality vehicle, AR projection, automotive visualization, driver-assist AR, NHTSA compliance, consumer misrepresentation, FTC advertising review, vehicle safety assessment

To Department of Transportation / National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) / National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) / Federal Trade Commission (FTC)

Request:

Requesting any and all reports, investigations, internal memoranda, or interagency communications from January 1, 2018 to present concerning the use of augmented reality (AR), mixed reality, or perceptual overlay technologies in connection with motor vehicle accidents, defect investigations, or consumer complaints.

This includes:
	•	Documentation of cases where vehicle appearance or branding was digitally modified or projected, potentially affecting attribution of responsibility for accidents or failures
	•	Communications with automakers, insurers, or technology vendors regarding the use of AR overlays to mask or misrepresent vehicle make, model, or condition during accidents
	•	Analyses of the role of perceptual overlays in consumer or witness reporting of crash events, including potential bias in attributing failures to specific vehicle brands
	•	Internal studies or risk assessments concerning the integrity of safety investigations when AR-altered vehicles are present in public environments
	•	Interagency discussions on fraud, misrepresentation, or accident attribution arising from AR vehicle visualization

Keywords: NHTSA AR accidents, NTSB perceptual overlay, vehicle misrepresentation, accident attribution, crash investigation integrity, brand bias, consumer deception, AR camouflage, mixed reality vehicles, insurance reporting

To Department of Homeland Security (DHS)

Request:

Requesting any and all reports, contracts, internal memoranda, or interagency communications from January 1, 2018 to present concerning the use of augmented reality (AR), mixed reality, or perceptual overlay technologies in relation to motor vehicles, public transportation assets, or civilian infrastructure.

This includes:
	•	Security assessments or threat analyses regarding vehicles whose visual appearance may be altered by AR projection or cloaking systems
	•	DHS Science and Technology Directorate research programs on AR visualization, camouflage, or perceptual manipulation of vehicles
	•	Communications with law enforcement agencies on recognition, identification, or tracking challenges posed by AR-based vehicle appearance modification
	•	Reports or complaints related to misuse of AR overlays to obscure or disguise vehicles in public space

Keywords: DHS AR research, perceptual overlay, mixed reality vehicles, AR cloaking, vehicle disguise, transportation security, visual deception, law enforcement recognition, S&T Directorate, infrastructure protection

To National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)

Request:

Requesting any and all technical standards documents, research initiatives, interagency communications, or external partnerships from January 1, 2018 to present concerning augmented reality (AR), mixed reality, or perceptual overlay systems as applied to automobiles or transportation infrastructure.

This includes:
	•	Development of standards or test protocols for AR visualization systems in vehicles or traffic environments
	•	Research on interoperability between AR projection technologies and existing vehicle sensors (e.g., radar, lidar, computer vision)
	•	Communications with automakers, technology firms, or defense contractors regarding visual cloaking, mixed reality camouflage, or digitally altered vehicle exteriors
	•	Reports on consumer safety, public trust, or misrepresentation issues linked to AR-based vehicle visualization

Keywords: NIST AR standards, perceptual overlay, automotive AR, vehicle visualization, mixed reality cloaking, lidar interoperability, sensor deception, transportation safety, technical standards, visual camouflage

To Department of Defense / Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) / Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) / Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA)

Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, internal memoranda, contracts, program descriptions, or interagency communications from January 1, 2015 to present concerning the behavioral or cognitive modeling of human responses to augmented reality (AR), mixed reality, or perceptual overlay systems applied to vehicles or transportation environments.

This includes:
	•	Studies of driver, pedestrian, or bystander perception when vehicle appearance is digitally modified through AR projection or cloaking
	•	Research on compliance, decision-making, or behavioral adaptation in response to AR-altered vehicle exteriors or traffic conditions
	•	Program materials assessing the predictive modeling potential of population-level exposure to AR vehicle visualization in public settings
	•	Communications with automakers, technology vendors, or research institutions related to AR overlays for behavioral influence, camouflage, or consumer testing
