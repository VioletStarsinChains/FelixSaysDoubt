To DHS (Science & Technology Directorate, Federal Protective Service), DOJ, and GSA

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, pilot program reports, internal communications, or research proposals involving Securitas (including Securitas Critical Infrastructure Services, SCIS, and subsidiaries) from 2005 to present, specifically where their services intersect with behavioral surveillance, predictive analytics, or cognitive/behavioral modeling.

This includes:
	•	Deployment of video analytics, AI-driven monitoring, or pattern-recognition software through Securitas contracts
	•	Use of Securitas personnel or systems in predictive policing, threat anticipation, or insider risk modeling programs
	•	Integration of Securitas remote monitoring centers with federal data platforms (e.g., Palantir, DHS HART, FBI systems)
	•	Research or vendor communications regarding “behavior detection officers,” microexpression analysis, or behavioral anomaly detection
	•	Pilot projects or evaluations involving airports, courthouses, federal buildings, or other critical infrastructure where behavioral surveillance was trialed or implemented by Securitas
	•	Oversight reports, audits, or risk-benefit analyses of behavioral modeling technologies introduced through Securitas contracts
	•	Correspondence between DHS S&T, FPS, TSA, or DOJ components and Securitas regarding predictive security capabilities or behavioral analytics

Keywords: Securitas, Securitas Critical Infrastructure Services, SCIS, behavioral surveillance, predictive modeling, anomaly detection, video analytics, remote monitoring, behavioral futures, threat anticipation, insider risk

To DHS (Science & Technology Directorate, Federal Protective Service), DOJ, and GSA

Request:

Requesting any and all contracts, internal communications, research proposals, or pilot program documentation involving Securitas (including Securitas Critical Infrastructure Services, SCIS, and subsidiaries) from 2005 to present, specifically in relation to the collection, analysis, or commercialization of behavioral data for predictive or market-facing purposes.

This includes:
	•	Documents on the use of Securitas surveillance systems or guard services as behavioral telemetry inputs for predictive analytics platforms
	•	Integration of Securitas’ remote monitoring centers with data brokers, third-party analytics firms, or government contractors engaged in behavioral futures markets
	•	Communications regarding monetization of behavioral data streams (e.g., movement patterns, microexpressions, workplace compliance signals) captured under security contracts
	•	Pilot programs where predictive modeling or “threat anticipation” capabilities were marketed as both a security product and a tool for behavior-based market speculation
	•	Oversight reports, audits, or OIG investigations into whether Securitas-enabled surveillance data was repurposed for commercial prediction markets
	•	Correspondence between DHS, DOJ, or GSA and Securitas regarding “behavior detection officers,” behavioral anomaly detection, or predictive risk profiling linked to financial or market applications

Keywords: Securitas, Securitas Critical Infrastructure Services, SCIS, behavioral surveillance, predictive modeling, behavioral futures markets, anomaly detection, behavioral telemetry, compliance signals, market speculation, remote monitoring

Request:

Requesting any and all contracts, internal communications, pilot program reports, or research documentation from 2005 to present involving Securitas (including Securitas Critical Infrastructure Services, SCIS, and subsidiaries) in connection with the replication, simulation, or use of security guard or police likenesses for behavioral compliance or synthetic training purposes.

This includes:
	•	Documents regarding augmented reality, virtual reality, or synthetic environment training programs that replicate law enforcement or security guard likenesses
	•	Research on the behavioral compliance effects of simulated or synthetic encounters with guards or police
	•	Contracts with Securitas for role-playing, digital likeness provision, or uniform-based compliance simulations
	•	Internal communications on the use of “synthetic hallucinations” of law enforcement or security personnel for crowd management, deterrence, or psychological operations
	•	Evaluations or pilot studies comparing behavioral response to authentic versus simulated/security-guard interactions
	•	Oversight reports, risk assessments, or ethical reviews regarding the use of guard likenesses or uniforms in synthetic environments
	•	Correspondence between DHS, DOJ, FPS, or GSA and Securitas related to training simulations, behavioral conditioning, or augmented-reality compliance scenarios
