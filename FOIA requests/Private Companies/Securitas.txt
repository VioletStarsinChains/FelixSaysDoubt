To DHS (Science & Technology Directorate, Federal Protective Service), DOJ, and GSA

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, pilot program reports, internal communications, or research proposals involving Securitas (including Securitas Critical Infrastructure Services, SCIS, and subsidiaries) from 2005 to present, specifically where their services intersect with behavioral surveillance, predictive analytics, or cognitive/behavioral modeling.

This includes:
	•	Deployment of video analytics, AI-driven monitoring, or pattern-recognition software through Securitas contracts
	•	Use of Securitas personnel or systems in predictive policing, threat anticipation, or insider risk modeling programs
	•	Integration of Securitas remote monitoring centers with federal data platforms (e.g., Palantir, DHS HART, FBI systems)
	•	Research or vendor communications regarding “behavior detection officers,” microexpression analysis, or behavioral anomaly detection
	•	Pilot projects or evaluations involving airports, courthouses, federal buildings, or other critical infrastructure where behavioral surveillance was trialed or implemented by Securitas
	•	Oversight reports, audits, or risk-benefit analyses of behavioral modeling technologies introduced through Securitas contracts
	•	Correspondence between DHS S&T, FPS, TSA, or DOJ components and Securitas regarding predictive security capabilities or behavioral analytics

Keywords: Securitas, Securitas Critical Infrastructure Services, SCIS, behavioral surveillance, predictive modeling, anomaly detection, video analytics, remote monitoring, behavioral futures, threat anticipation, insider risk

To DHS (Science & Technology Directorate, Federal Protective Service), DOJ, and GSA

Request:

Requesting any and all contracts, internal communications, research proposals, or pilot program documentation involving Securitas (including Securitas Critical Infrastructure Services, SCIS, and subsidiaries) from 2005 to present, specifically in relation to the collection, analysis, or commercialization of behavioral data for predictive or market-facing purposes.

This includes:
	•	Documents on the use of Securitas surveillance systems or guard services as behavioral telemetry inputs for predictive analytics platforms
	•	Integration of Securitas’ remote monitoring centers with data brokers, third-party analytics firms, or government contractors engaged in behavioral futures markets
	•	Communications regarding monetization of behavioral data streams (e.g., movement patterns, microexpressions, workplace compliance signals) captured under security contracts
	•	Pilot programs where predictive modeling or “threat anticipation” capabilities were marketed as both a security product and a tool for behavior-based market speculation
	•	Oversight reports, audits, or OIG investigations into whether Securitas-enabled surveillance data was repurposed for commercial prediction markets
	•	Correspondence between DHS, DOJ, or GSA and Securitas regarding “behavior detection officers,” behavioral anomaly detection, or predictive risk profiling linked to financial or market applications
