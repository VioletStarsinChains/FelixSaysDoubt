 DHS (Science & Technology Directorate), DOJ, and GSA

Request:

Requesting any and all contracts, pilot program documentation, internal communications, or research proposals from 2005 to present involving Starbucks and Palantir Technologies, specifically in relation to behavioral surveillance, predictive modeling, or consumer compliance testing in retail environments.

This includes:
	•	Records of Starbucks customer interaction data integrated into Palantir platforms (e.g., Gotham, Foundry, HHS Protect, or other analytic tools)
	•	Communications regarding the use of Starbucks retail sites for behavioral modeling or customer compliance experiments, including deployment of different employee “archetypes” to assess consumer response
	•	Documentation of pilot programs where barista archetypes (e.g., effeminate young gay male, grandmotherly female, butch lesbian, etc.) were tested and resulting data processed through Palantir systems
	•	Contracts or correspondence regarding Starbucks as a commercial partner in Palantir-led behavioral modeling or consumer compliance studies
	•	Oversight reports, audits, or risk assessments of retail-based behavioral data flows into Palantir predictive platforms
	•	Research or internal analysis comparing archetype-based staffing/customer interaction models and their predictive value for compliance or risk profiling
	•	Correspondence between DHS, DOJ, GSA, Starbucks, and Palantir concerning joint behavioral analytics, predictive modeling, or futures market applications

Keywords: Starbucks, Palantir, Gotham, Foundry, behavioral modeling, predictive analytics, compliance testing, archetype staffing, consumer response, behavioral futures markets

To DHS (Science & Technology Directorate), DOJ, and FTC

Request:

Requesting any and all contracts, pilot program documentation, research proposals, or internal communications from 2005 to present regarding the use of Starbucks retail environments for behavioral modeling experiments involving synthetic hallucinations or synthetic staff likenesses.

This includes:
	•	Records of projects where barista likenesses or archetypes (e.g., effeminate young gay male, grandmotherly female, butch lesbian, etc.) were replicated in synthetic environments to measure differential customer compliance or behavioral response
	•	Contracts or communications involving Starbucks as a partner site for synthetic hallucination testing, augmented reality trials, or NPC-based behavioral experiments
	•	Research proposals or evaluations on consumer behavior when interacting with synthetic baristas compared to authentic employees
	•	Documentation of any role-player, avatar, or digital likeness libraries created to simulate Starbucks staff profiles
	•	Oversight reports, ethical reviews, or risk assessments related to the use of appropriated human likenesses in retail synthetic environments
	•	Correspondence between DHS, DOJ, FTC, and Starbucks regarding behavioral data collection, predictive modeling, or compliance testing in customer-facing settings

Keywords: Starbucks, synthetic hallucination, synthetic barista, behavioral modeling, NPC, appropriated likeness, archetype testing, predictive analytics, compliance anchors, consumer response
