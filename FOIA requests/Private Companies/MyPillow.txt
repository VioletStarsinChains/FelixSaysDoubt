Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, contracts, or internal communications concerning the use of consumer bedding products (including pillows, mattresses, and sleep accessories) as vectors for cognitive or behavioral entrainment from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Studies or pilot programs testing sleep-related consumer goods for signal delivery or neuromodulation
	•	Contracts or partnerships with private bedding companies for research on embedded sensors, microelectronics, or signal-transducing fabrics
	•	Reports on olfactory, vibrational, or electromagnetic entrainment delivered via consumer bedding
	•	Risk–benefit analyses concerning population-scale exposure to sleep-phase entrainment through household goods
	•	Internal discussions of “anchor objects” or continuity markers in behavioral modeling tied to consumer products

Keywords: entrainment, consumer bedding, MyPillow, sleep modulation, trigeminal nerve, continuity anchor, olfactory vector, microelectronics in textiles, neuromodulation, FCC compliance
