To Federal Trade Commission (FTC) / Department of Transportation (DOT) / National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)

Request:

Requesting any and all contracts, reports, technical evaluations, or interagency communications from January 1, 2010 to present concerning the secondary use of consumer telematics data collected through insurance incentive programs (e.g., Progressive Snapshot, Allstate Drivewise, State Farm Drive Safe & Save, Nationwide SmartRide, or comparable programs) for applications involving augmented reality (AR), mixed reality, or perceptual overlay technologies in transportation.

This includes:
	•	Analyses of whether telematics data on acceleration, braking, steering, and location has been shared with automakers, defense contractors, or technology vendors for AR visualization or vehicle projection systems
	•	Regulatory reviews of consumer consent, data-sharing disclosures, or re-use of insurance telematics data for purposes other than underwriting or pricing
	•	Communications regarding research collaborations between insurance carriers, federal agencies, and third-party contractors on the application of telematics data to AR vehicle modeling or simulation
	•	Reports, audits, or complaints concerning consumer deception or privacy risks in the repurposing of telematics data for non-insurance AR or mixed reality projects
	•	Interagency discussions of AR-enabled vehicle projection systems that depend on telematics-derived datasets to accurately simulate or overlay vehicle performance in real time

Keywords: telematics, Progressive Snapshot, Allstate Drivewise, State Farm Drive Safe & Save, insurance data sharing, AR vehicle modeling, perceptual overlay, mixed reality transportation, consumer consent, NHTSA compliance, FTC privacy

Request:

Requesting any and all threat assessments, program documentation, contracts, research proposals, pilot/field test reports, legal/privacy reviews, or interagency communications between January 1, 2010 and present on the acquisition, sharing, or use of consumer automobile telematics data from insurance “usage‑based” programs (e.g., Progressive Snapshot, Allstate Drivewise, State Farm Drive Safe & Save, Nationwide SmartRide, or comparable programs) for applications involving augmented reality (AR), mixed reality, or perceptual overlay systems that modify perceived vehicle identity/appearance/kinematics in public space, or for target tracking, operational deception, or attribution control.

This includes:
	•	Data‑sharing agreements, memoranda of understanding, or procurement records with insurers, telematics vendors, or data brokers for telematics‑derived datasets (e.g., GPS traces, accelerometer/gyroscope streams, braking/acceleration profiles, VIN linkage, mobile device co‑location).
	•	Research or operational evaluations of AR‑enabled vehicle camouflage/brand substitution or perceptual masking that leverage telematics‑derived motion signatures to register overlays to real vehicles in real time.
	•	Threat models, risk assessments, concepts of operations (CONOPS), or after‑action reports on the use of telematics‑fed AR systems to misattribute accidents, mechanical failures, or sabotage events to alternate makes/models (“attribution shielding”).
	•	Documentation of sensor‑fusion pipelines combining insurance telematics with ALPR, cellular/Wi‑Fi telemetry, RF beacons, or government sensor networks for real‑time vehicle projection, cloaking, or identity substitution.
	•	Communications with defense contractors, integrators, or national laboratories concerning dual‑use exploitation of insurance telematics for operational deception, counterforensics, or reputational targeting.
	•	Policy determinations, privacy impact assessments, or legal analyses on repurposing consumer‑origin telematics for non‑insurance security applications (including consent, de‑identification, minimization, retention, and secondary‑use limitations).
