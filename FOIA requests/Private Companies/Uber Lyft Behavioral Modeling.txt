To Department of Transportation (DOT) / Federal Trade Commission (FTC) / Department of Justice (DOJ)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, research proposals, or internal communications from 2010 to present regarding the use of ride-hailing platforms such as Uber and Lyft for behavioral futures modeling, predictive analytics, or surveillance applications—particularly in connection with passenger safety incidents disproportionately affecting women and AFAB individuals.

This includes:
	•	Records of behavioral analysis or predictive modeling projects conducted using ride-hailing trip data, passenger feedback, or safety complaints
	•	Communications or contracts between Uber/Lyft and federal agencies or private contractors (e.g., Palantir, Accenture, Booz Allen, etc.) concerning behavioral telemetry collection
	•	Risk assessments, audits, or reports describing how passenger experiences—especially “sketchy” or unsafe ride reports—were analyzed for behavioral futures markets applications
	•	Internal evaluations of driver–passenger dynamics as behavioral influence testing environments
	•	Records of AI/machine learning models trained on passenger incident reports or in-ride behavioral data to forecast compliance, vulnerability, or consumer behavior
	•	Whistleblower reports, ethics reviews, or consumer protection inquiries into the manipulation of ride-hailing conditions for behavioral testing
	•	Communications referencing gendered or demographic segmentation in ride-hailing safety data, particularly as applied to predictive surveillance frameworks

Keywords: Uber, Lyft, behavioral futures markets, predictive modeling, passenger safety, harassment data, gender targeting, Palantir contract, behavioral telemetry, surveillance analytics

To Department of Transportation (DOT) / Department of Justice (DOJ) / Department of Homeland Security (DHS) / Federal Trade Commission (FTC)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, internal communications, or program evaluations from 2010 to present regarding the use of ride-hailing platforms (Uber, Lyft, or affiliates) as data environments for behavioral futures modeling, predictive policing, or surveillance applications, with specific emphasis on race and racialized safety incidents.

This includes:
	•	Records of ride-hailing incidents or safety interventions analyzed through a racial or demographic lens (e.g., passengers of color targeted for “protection” or harm in staged or manipulated ride scenarios)
	•	Communications or contracts between Uber/Lyft and federal agencies or private contractors (e.g., Palantir, Booz Allen, Accenture) regarding the use of racially segmented safety data for behavioral modeling or threat assessment
	•	Reports or internal studies describing ride-hailing as a testing ground for compliance, trust, or vulnerability under racially charged circumstances
	•	Documentation of staged, synthetic, or manipulated ride offers framed as protective interventions (e.g., third parties ordering rides for individuals deemed “unsafe” due to race, gender, or location)
	•	Ethics reviews, whistleblower complaints, or adverse event reports involving racially motivated surveillance, targeting, or behavioral testing using ride-hailing platforms
	•	Analyses of passenger data showing disproportionate impacts on Black riders, Indigenous riders, or other marginalized groups, especially in contexts involving harassment, coercion, or synthetic safety narratives
	•	Records connecting ride-hailing data to predictive policing systems, community threat indices, or behavioral futures markets with explicit racial dimensions

Keywords: Uber, Lyft, behavioral futures, predictive policing, racial targeting, synthetic safety interventions, Palantir contract, harassment data, compliance modeling, surveillance analytics, bus stop incident

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, internal communications, or program evaluations from 2010 to present regarding the use of ride-hailing platforms (Uber, Lyft, or affiliates) in staged or synthetic safety scenarios, particularly those exploiting racialized vulnerability to generate behavioral data for predictive analytics or behavioral futures markets.

This includes:
	•	Records describing the use of ride-hailing in “false rescue” scenarios where passengers of color were pressured, persuaded, or coerced into rides under the pretense of safety (e.g., being told a bus stop or public space was unsafe due to racialized threats)
	•	Communications between ride-hailing companies and federal agencies or contractors (e.g., Palantir, Booz Allen Hamilton, Accenture) regarding the modeling of compliance, trust, or vulnerability in racially charged contexts
	•	Reports on ride-hailing being used as a controlled environment for synthetic encounters or manipulated interventions framed as protective actions
	•	Ethics reviews, consumer protection inquiries, or whistleblower reports addressing whether staged “rescue rides” were repurposed for surveillance, coercion, or behavioral testing
	•	Documentation of ride-hailing data being segmented by race to assess passenger responses to interventions, harassment, or perceived danger
	•	Records linking racially charged ride-hailing incidents to predictive policing systems, community risk indices, or broader behavioral futures markets
	•	Analyses of psychological outcomes for riders of color subjected to manipulated interventions or staged rides under threat narratives

Keywords: Uber, Lyft, racialized surveillance, false rescue scenario, synthetic encounter, behavioral futures markets, predictive policing, compliance modeling, Palantir contract, racial targeting, coerced ride

To Department of Homeland Security (DHS) / Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) / Department of Justice (DOJ) / Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, internal communications, or program evaluations from 2010 to present regarding the use of ride-hailing platforms (Uber, Lyft, or affiliates) within counterterrorism or Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) initiatives, particularly as applied to racially charged environments and synthetic “rescue” scenarios.

This includes:
	•	Records describing ride-hailing platforms being used to stage or simulate protective interventions for passengers of color (e.g., being told they were unsafe waiting in public spaces due to white supremacist threats, then steered into an Uber/Lyft)
	•	Contracts, pilot programs, or communications between DHS/FBI and ride-hailing companies (or contractors such as Palantir, Booz Allen Hamilton, Accenture) regarding CVE applications of racialized ride-hailing incident data
	•	Documentation of ride-hailing incidents being used as controlled environments for testing compliance, trust, vulnerability, or racialized threat perception in CVE contexts
	•	Reports on how passenger race, gender, or demographic data was segmented in predictive analytics models for “threat assessment” or “community risk monitoring”
	•	Ethics reviews, whistleblower complaints, or adverse event reports concerning the exploitation of racialized vulnerability in ride-hailing environments for behavioral futures markets or CVE simulations
	•	Communications linking ride-hailing safety narratives to counterterrorism frameworks, including predictive policing, community threat indices, or behavioral modeling of extremist recruitment/response
	•	Analyses of synthetic encounter design (e.g., staged rescues, coerced rides, manufactured safety interventions) as data-generation strategies under CVE programs
