Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, internal communications, or program evaluations from 2010 to present regarding the use of ride-hailing platforms (Uber, Lyft, or affiliates) in staged or synthetic safety scenarios, particularly those exploiting racialized vulnerability to generate behavioral data for predictive analytics or behavioral futures markets.

	•	Communications linking ride-hailing safety narratives to counterterrorism frameworks, including predictive policing, community threat indices, or behavioral modeling of extremist recruitment/response
