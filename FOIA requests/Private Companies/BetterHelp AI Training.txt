To Federal Trade Commission (FTC) / Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) / National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, internal communications, research proposals, or vendor agreements from 2010 to present regarding the use of BetterHelp (or its parent/affiliate companies) as a data source or training environment for artificial intelligence systems in the areas of behavioral analysis, surveillance, or predictive modeling.

This includes:
	•	Contracts or agreements between BetterHelp and government agencies, AI vendors, or defense contractors involving the collection or licensing of therapy session data
	•	Communications or assessments regarding the suitability of online therapy platforms for behavioral futures markets or predictive analytics
	•	Documentation of patient transcripts, metadata, or interaction logs used as AI training corpora
	•	Risk-benefit analyses concerning the ethical implications of using psychotherapy data for surveillance or adversarial modeling
	•	Program evaluations of therapist workload, burnout, or “caseload offshoring” via BetterHelp and its intersection with AI data harvesting
	•	Internal discussions referencing the inversion of therapy frameworks (e.g., CBT, trauma-informed practice, rapport-building) into coercive or surveillance applications
	•	Reports on consumer deception, patient consent, or lack thereof in relation to AI training uses of BetterHelp data

Keywords: BetterHelp AI training, therapy data harvesting, behavioral analytics, predictive modeling, online therapy surveillance, therapeutic inversion, CBT dataset, patient metadata, behavioral futures markets, adversarial rapport

To Federal Trade Commission (FTC) / Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) / Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, internal communications, or regulatory reviews from 2010 to present regarding BetterHelp’s role as both a teletherapy provider and a data source for artificial intelligence training, surveillance applications, or behavioral futures markets.

This includes:
	•	Records of patient transcripts, session metadata, or therapeutic interaction logs being shared, licensed, or sold for AI training purposes
	•	Communications acknowledging that BetterHelp functioned as a large-scale behavioral dataset rather than solely as a healthcare provider
	•	Reports, audits, or consumer protection inquiries into whether patients were adequately informed that their therapy conversations might fuel AI development or government surveillance programs
	•	Analyses of how therapeutic frameworks (CBT, motivational interviewing, rapport-building) were adapted into adversarial models for influence, coercion, or population-level behavioral prediction
	•	Contracts, pilot projects, or subcontracts involving Palantir, DARPA, or other defense/AI contractors referencing BetterHelp data streams
	•	Risk assessments, ethics reviews, or whistleblower complaints regarding the inversion of therapy (a space of care and trust) into a behavioral extraction funnel for machine learning systems
	•	Marketing, recruitment, or public-facing communications framing BetterHelp as a safe alternative to traditional therapy while internally promoting its value as a data pipeline

Keywords: BetterHelp surveillance, therapy data funnel, AI training corpus, behavioral futures markets, coerced consent, CBT inversion, adversarial modeling, metadata harvesting, Palantir subcontract, teletherapy dataset

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, internal communications, research proposals, or evaluations from 2010 to present regarding the use of BetterHelp (and its affiliates or parent companies) as a data source for predictive policing, surveillance, or behavioral threat modeling.

This includes:
	•	Contracts or agreements between BetterHelp and federal agencies, or with private contractors (e.g., Palantir, Booz Allen Hamilton, SAIC, Accenture, etc.) involving therapy session data for law enforcement or predictive analytics
	•	Internal communications describing how therapeutic frameworks (CBT, trauma-informed care, rapport-building) could be inverted for predictive policing applications
	•	Risk assessments or ethics reviews regarding the use of teletherapy data to forecast “threat levels,” “radicalization potential,” or “community risk indices”
	•	Reports or pilot programs on using BetterHelp datasets to train machine learning models for surveillance, public safety monitoring, or threat prevention
	•	Vendor partnerships involving behavioral futures markets or compliance modeling derived from therapy transcripts and metadata
	•	Documents addressing consumer deception, coerced consent, or the non-therapeutic repurposing of patient information in predictive policing contexts
	•	Whistleblower complaints, audits, or internal evaluations concerning therapist recruitment into surveillance analyst roles through BetterHelp-related pipelines
