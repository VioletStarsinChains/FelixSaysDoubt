Subject: FOIA Request – Possible Use of Neurotechnology in the 1992 McDonald’s Hot Coffee Spill Incident

To Whom It May Concern,

Under the Freedom of Information Act, I am requesting all records, reports, communications, or analyses in the possession of your agency concerning possible use of covert neurotechnology or related remote-influence systems in connection with the February 1992 McDonald’s hot coffee spill incident involving Stella Liebeck.

Specifically, I request documents that may include, but are not limited to:
	1.	Any assessments of whether the physical actions leading to the spill could have been influenced by remote neural manipulation, muscle control interference, or other directed-energy/neurotechnology systems.
	2.	Records on the testing, deployment, or demonstration of such systems in retail or fast-food environments between 1990 and 1994.
	3.	Any internal or contractor communications mentioning the incident as a potential case study, demonstration, or operational data point.
	4.	Any files involving McDonald’s corporate security, private defense contractors, or federal/state agencies referencing the spill in the context of technology testing.
	5.	Reports from intelligence, law enforcement, or defense-related entities regarding covert technology trials involving civilian injury, especially those tied to major civil litigation or media coverage.

This request is directed to:
	•	FBI – Behavioral analysis, domestic operations, and contractor oversight.
	•	CIA – Technology testing and foreign intelligence crossover programs.
	•	DARPA – Research into remote influence and neural control systems.
	•	DOD Inspector General – Oversight of possible military contractor involvement.
	•	NSA – Signals/data relevant to directed neural influence or surveillance.
	•	DOE – If national labs had any role in tech R&D or contractor collaboration.
	•	FTC – Consumer harm investigations, especially where corporate liability intersects with tech testing.

I am willing to accept any redacted portions as long as they are marked with the appropriate FOIA exemption codes. Please conduct a search of both classified and unclassified holdings, including contractor files and subcontractor communications.

Subject: FOIA Request – Covert Neurotechnology Trials in Elder-Care Settings (1990–1994)

To Whom It May Concern,

Under the Freedom of Information Act, I request all records, reports, communications, contracts, or analyses concerning the testing, deployment, or demonstration of covert neurotechnology systems — including but not limited to remote neural manipulation, motor control interference, sensory modulation, or directed-energy applications — in elder-care, nursing home, assisted living, hospice, or geriatric medical settings between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 1994.

Specifically, I request:
	1.	Documentation of research programs, pilot tests, or technology demonstrations targeting or involving elderly populations, whether voluntary or non-consensual.
	2.	Any incident reports, injury logs, or mortality reviews in which covert neurotechnology was assessed as a possible factor.
	3.	Communications between federal agencies, contractors, and private-sector elder-care facilities about the potential or actual use of such technologies.
	4.	Internal analyses on the suitability of elderly individuals for neurotechnology trials due to perceived vulnerability, reduced public visibility, or litigation deterrence.
	5.	Contractor or subcontractor deliverables, meeting minutes, or budget justifications related to such trials.
	6.	Records of any ethics reviews, legal analyses, or oversight findings related to neurotechnology trials in elder-care environments.

This request is directed to:
	•	FBI – Domestic operations, behavioral analysis, and contractor oversight.
	•	CIA – Technology trials and foreign program crossover.
	•	DARPA – R&D and operational test records.
	•	DOD Inspector General – Oversight of military or contractor activities in civilian settings.
	•	NSA – Data or signals monitoring relevant to trials.
	•	DOE – If national laboratories or contractors were involved in tech development.
	•	HHS / NIH – Biomedical trials, geriatric research, and hospital collaborations.
	•	VA – Elderly veteran care facilities as potential test sites.

Please search both classified and unclassified holdings, including contractor and subcontractor communications. I am willing to accept redacted documents provided they are marked with the applicable FOIA exemption codes.
