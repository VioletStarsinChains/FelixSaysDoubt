Request:

Requesting any and all documents, internal communications, contracts, vendor agreements, pilot projects, or research proposals from 2005 to present referencing the collection, analysis, or surveillance of consumer biofluids (including urine, saliva, sweat, or blood) in retail or food-service environments.

This includes:
	•	Records of corporate partnerships with beverage or food-service companies (including Starbucks Corporation) regarding the collection or testing of consumer biofluids.
	•	Communications discussing the use of urine or other samples to screen for substances administered covertly or through fortified products.
	•	Documents concerning the use of biofluid data for continuity management, anomaly classification, or attrition escalation.
	•	Risk assessments, ethical reviews, or regulatory analyses addressing nonconsensual biofluid collection in consumer contexts.
	•	Reports of field trials, pilot programs, or technical demonstrations involving covert or automated biofluid surveillance in retail environments.
	•	Interagency communications between HHS, FDA, DHS, or private contractors regarding the overlap of consumer dosing and biofluid monitoring.

Keywords: biofluid surveillance, urine collection, consumer testing, covert dosing, anomaly classification, attrition escalation, Starbucks, Clover system, retail surveillance, nonconsensual monitoring, continuity management

⸻ 

To: Department of Defense (DoD) / Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, research proposals, internal communications, or technical reports from 2005 to present referencing the development, deployment, or testing of consumer biofluid surveillance technologies in civilian or retail environments.

This includes:
	•	DARPA or DoD-funded research into noninvasive or covert biofluid collection (urine, saliva, sweat, blood) in public or commercial spaces.
	•	Pilot programs involving food-service or retail companies (including Starbucks Corporation) as environments for biofluid sampling.
	•	Studies or demonstrations linking covert dosing protocols (including GLP-1 receptor agonists and related compounds) with subsequent biofluid monitoring.
	•	Analyses describing the use of biofluid data for anomaly detection, continuity management, or attrition escalation.
	•	Cross-agency communications with DHS, HHS, or FDA regarding behavioral surveillance programs that integrate product consumption with biofluid analysis.
	•	Vendor agreements with defense contractors or biotech firms to design or implement such surveillance in civilian contexts.

Keywords: DARPA, consumer biofluid surveillance, covert dosing, anomaly detection, attrition escalation, Starbucks, Clover system, noninvasive urine collection, behavioral futures, continuity management, military-civilian pilot

To: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) / Office of Air and Radiation

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, inspection reports, internal communications, or regulatory filings from 2005 to present referencing indoor or outdoor air quality, ventilation practices, or airborne substance dispersal in Starbucks Corporation retail stores.

This includes:
	•	Records of EPA investigations or communications regarding the release of chemical compounds, fragrances, or aerosols into Starbucks retail environments.
	•	Documents concerning the impact of Starbucks’ air handling or ventilation systems on adjacent outdoor spaces such as patios, sidewalks, or shared public areas.
	•	Communications with Starbucks or its contractors about compliance with Clean Air Act or other EPA-regulated air quality standards in consumer-facing environments.
	•	Reports, pilot projects, or analyses relating to the dispersal of chemical or pharmaceutical compounds through retail HVAC systems.
	•	Interagency communications between EPA, OSHA, NIOSH, FDA, or DHS concerning Starbucks’ environmental air quality practices or consumer exposure risks.
	•	Any records regarding the potential ecological or community impact of airborne compounds released from Starbucks retail locations.

Keywords: Starbucks, ventilation, HVAC, air handling, air quality, Clean Air Act, fragrance dispersal, aerosolized compounds, covert dosing, outdoor patio exposure, environmental compliance
