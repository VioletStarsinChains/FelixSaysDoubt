To Federal Trade Commission (FTC) / Department of Labor (DOL)

Request:

Requesting any and all reports, program documentation, regulatory filings, contracts, complaints, or interagency communications from January 1, 2010 to present concerning the deployment of robotic or automated staff in food service or retail environments where augmented reality (AR), mixed reality, or perceptual overlay technologies are used to present those systems as human workers.

This includes:
	•	Analyses of consumer protection or deceptive practice concerns when robotic staff are visually represented as human employees without disclosure
	•	Labor classification or employment law reviews concerning the substitution of robotic systems for human workers in establishments serving the public
	•	Occupational health and safety evaluations of consumer-facing robots masked by AR visualization
	•	Communications with food service corporations, technology vendors, or contractors regarding pilot programs using AR overlays to alter public perception of robotic or automated staff
	•	Reports of consumer complaints, audits, or enforcement actions related to misrepresentation of staff identity through AR systems

Keywords: augmented reality, perceptual overlay, robotic staff, AR masking, human-robot interaction, food service automation, deceptive practice, consumer protection, labor classification, DOL compliance, FTC enforcement

To Food and Drug Administration (FDA) / Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) / U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) / Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS)

Request:

Requesting any and all reports, regulatory filings, inspection records, contracts, or interagency communications from January 1, 2010 to present concerning the deployment of robotic or automated staff in food service establishments where augmented reality (AR), mixed reality, or perceptual overlay technologies are used to present such systems as human workers.

This includes:
	•	Food safety compliance reviews of robotic food handlers, baristas, or kitchen staff operating under AR-based human overlays
	•	Inspection protocols or guidance related to sanitation, contamination risk, or hazard analysis when automated systems are substituted for human workers in retail food environments
	•	Communications with restaurant chains, contractors, or technology vendors regarding the use of AR visualization to alter the apparent identity of robotic food service staff
	•	Reports of consumer complaints, violations, or enforcement actions linked to undisclosed substitution of robotic staff for human employees in food handling or preparation
	•	Interagency discussions of transparency, labeling, or disclosure requirements in cases where AR or mixed reality systems are used to mask the presence of robotic staff in food service environments

Keywords: augmented reality, perceptual overlay, robotic food handlers, AR masking, food service automation, CFSAN compliance, FSIS inspection, sanitation protocols, consumer disclosure, mixed reality workforce

To Department of Homeland Security (DHS) / DHS Science & Technology Directorate (S&T) / DHS Office of Intelligence & Analysis (I&A)

Request:

Requesting any and all reports, risk assessments, program documentation, contracts, or interagency communications from January 1, 2010 to present concerning the deployment of robotic or automated staff in food service, retail, or other public gathering environments where augmented reality (AR), mixed reality, or perceptual overlay technologies are used to present those systems as human workers.

This includes:
	•	Threat analyses of security vulnerabilities associated with undisclosed robotic staff operating in high-traffic public venues under AR-based human overlays
	•	DHS S&T research or pilot projects evaluating the behavioral, crowd management, or compliance effects of interacting with AR-masked robotic systems
	•	Communications with corporations, defense contractors, or technology vendors regarding robotic staff cloaked by AR or mixed reality in civilian environments
	•	Reports on counterintelligence, counterterrorism, or critical infrastructure protection implications of concealing robotic systems from the public through AR visualization
	•	Interagency discussions of disclosure, transparency, or policy requirements for identifying robotic staff operating under AR overlays in commercial establishments

Keywords: DHS threat assessment, robotic staff, AR masking, perceptual overlay, mixed reality workforce, public venue security, compliance testing, behavioral modeling, critical infrastructure, undisclosed automation

To Department of Defense / Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) / Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) / Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA)

Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, BAA responses, contracts, program descriptions, evaluation reports, data management plans, privacy/ethics reviews, pilot or field-test reports, and interagency communications from January 1, 2010 to present concerning behavioral or cognitive modeling of human responses to robotic or automated systems presented to the public as human workers through augmented reality (AR), mixed reality, or perceptual overlay technologies in retail or food-service environments.

This includes:
	•	Human factors experiments on trust, compliance, purchasing behavior, dwell time, crowd dynamics, or situational awareness when robotic staff are masked by human AR avatars
	•	Research on disclosure/consent protocols, debriefing procedures, and IRB determinations for studies involving undisclosed AR masking of robotic staff
	•	Program materials on perception management, digital human rendering, identity substitution, and avatar fidelity as it relates to behavior change
	•	Sensor-fusion and data collection methodologies (e.g., camera analytics, POS data, Wi‑Fi/BLE telemetry, mobile co‑location, eye-tracking) used to model behavioral outcomes
	•	Evaluations of risks, failure modes, or safety interactions in HRI when visual representations differ from physical actuation (avatar–robot mismatch)
	•	Communications with corporations, system integrators, or universities regarding pilots in commercial venues (e.g., cafés, quick‑service restaurants, retail stores)
	•	Metrics, dashboards, or predictive models derived from such pilots for population-level forecasting or operational applications

Keywords: DARPA human factors, IARPA behavioral modeling, augmented reality masking, perceptual overlay, digital human avatars, human‑robot interaction, retail pilot, disclosure and consent, population‑level forecasting, identity substitution, sensor fusion, ethics/IRB
