Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, communications, laboratory analyses, inspection reports, or investigative files from January 1, 2000 to present concerning the composition, safety, and distribution of used coffee grounds provided to the public through Starbucks’ “Grounds for Your Garden” program.

This includes:
	•	Laboratory testing results for pesticide residues, mycotoxins, acrylamide, synthetic flavoring compounds, or other contaminants in coffee grounds distributed through this program
	•	Records of chemical persistence or breakdown of such compounds in soil or compost environments, including any studies on impacts to soil microbiota or edible crops grown in amended soil
	•	Consumer or organizational complaints, adverse reports, or incident files referencing contamination, plant damage, or health effects linked to the use of Starbucks’ distributed coffee grounds
	•	Contracts, statements of work, or task orders involving Starbucks, its waste management vendors, or federal contractors (including Palantir Technologies, Accenture Federal Services, Deloitte, Booz Allen Hamilton) for tracking, mapping, or analyzing the geographic dispersal of coffee grounds provided to the public
	•	Communications regarding targeted distribution of grounds through specific stores, regions, or community organizations, particularly where distribution was linked to environmental, agricultural, or behavioral research studies
	•	Internal or contracted reports describing the role of the “Grounds for Your Garden” program in sustainability initiatives, geofenced community engagement, or behavioral futures market research
	•	Records of coordination between Starbucks and EPA, USDA, or FDA on guidelines, risk assessments, or testing protocols for public distribution of unprocessed coffee grounds
