Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, contracts, or internal communications concerning the use of Beanie Babies or other mass-distributed stuffed animals as tools for cognitive, behavioral, or emotional entrainment from 1993 to present.

This includes:
	•	Research into tactile or olfactory entrainment via stuffed toys marketed to children
	•	Contracts or collaborations with toy manufacturers regarding embedded sensors, RFID tags, or passive resonant elements in plush products
	•	Reports on the use of stuffed animals as “continuity anchors” in childhood development or behavioral modeling
	•	Internal studies on long-term psychological imprinting created by fad collectibles such as Beanie Babies
	•	Risk assessments or ethical reviews related to mass distribution of entrainment-capable objects through toy retail markets

Keywords: Beanie Babies, stuffed animal entrainment, continuity anchor, tactile modulation, olfactory conditioning, RFID toys, collectible fads, behavioral futures, neuromodulation, DARPA childhood research

To Department of Defense / DARPA / NIH / FCC

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, contracts, or internal communications concerning the use of stuffed animals and consumer bedding products as sequential vectors for behavioral entrainment, spanning from childhood to adulthood, from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Studies comparing childhood entrainment through stuffed toys (e.g., Beanie Babies) with adult entrainment through pillows, mattresses, or sleep accessories
	•	Internal communications discussing continuity anchors or transitional objects as part of long-term behavioral modeling
	•	Reports on the role of tactile, olfactory, or vibrational entrainment in developing dependency on comfort objects across life stages
	•	Contracts with toy or bedding manufacturers for embedding RFID, resonant materials, or slow-release chemical treatments into consumer products
	•	Risk–benefit analyses regarding population-scale exposure to entrainment via mass-market “comfort goods”

Keywords: Beanie Babies, MyPillow, continuity anchors, transitional objects, stuffed animal entrainment, bedding entrainment, RFID toys, neuromodulation, tactile conditioning, behavioral futures
