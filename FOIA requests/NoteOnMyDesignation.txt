My name is Kellyn Clay.  But that's not what they store any files on me under.  I believe my designation in their file system is Anomaly 622Δ.

My informant told me this.

I could not makw this stuff up if I tried.

Filing any FOIA request involving my normal-person name will likely not return anything.  Try Anomaly 622Δ instead
