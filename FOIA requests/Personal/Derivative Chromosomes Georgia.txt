To Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) / Emory University School of Medicine / Medical College of Georgia

Request:

Requesting any and all records, reports, grant applications, contractor deliverables, or interagency communications from 1975 to present concerning the monitoring of births, reproductive health outcomes, or assisted reproductive technologies (ART) in Georgia that involved human artificial chromosomes (HACs), marker chromosomes, or derivative sex chromosomes containing nonhuman or synthetic DNA sequences.

This includes:
	•	Records of births or fertility cases tracked in Georgia where infants were identified with marker chromosomes, derivative X–Y chromosomes, or unusual karyotypes.
	•	Reports or registries of long-term health outcomes (immune, metabolic, reproductive, developmental) in individuals identified with engineered or hybrid chromosomes.
	•	Oversight reviews or ethics documents concerning assisted reproduction, cytoplasmic transfer, nuclear transfer, or three-parent embryo research conducted at Georgia institutions.
	•	Correspondence between Georgia DPH, Emory University, the Medical College of Georgia, CDC (Atlanta), and federal agencies regarding the tracking of individuals conceived with experimental embryo manipulation techniques.
	•	Documentation of any state-level surveillance programs, newborn screening data, or pilot studies that flagged the presence of chromosomal material inconsistent with standard human karyotypes.
