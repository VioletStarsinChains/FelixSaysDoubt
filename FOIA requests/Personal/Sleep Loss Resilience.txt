To: Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) FOIA Office

Request:

Under the Freedom of Information Act, I am requesting access to all documents, reports, emails, data logs, contracts, or communications—whether from government employees or contractors—referencing Kellyn Clay/Anomaly 622Δ or data derived from subject in connection with research, experimentation, modeling, or analysis of resilience to long-term sleep deprivation, between 1988 and 2025.

This includes, but is not limited to:
	•	The Continuous Assisted Performance (CAP) program
	•	Peak Soldier Performance initiatives
	•	Cognitive load or alertness profiling
	•	Neuroadaptive systems or closed-loop feedback for performance optimization
	•	Passive data collection for sleep cycle manipulation or entrainment
	•	Psychological or neurocognitive studies on “natural insomniacs” or individuals with abnormal tolerance to sleep loss
	•	Use of biometric, neurobehavioral, or psychometric profiling to identify anomalous sleep-independent function
	•	Any test subject profiling classified under “neurocognitive anomaly” or “non-standard human performance model”

Please include communications with third-party contractors, such as:
	•	Palantir Technologies
	•	NeuroBehavioral Systems
	•	Advanced Brain Monitoring
	•	Awake Labs
	•	MIT Lincoln Lab
	•	or any academic collaborators receiving federal funding in this domain.

If documents referencing me have been withheld in prior FOIA responses under redaction or exemption clauses, I request a re-review of those records in light of this focused query.

If possible, I request expedited processing on the grounds that this information is urgently needed to clarify the nature of potentially non-consensual data collection and experimentation related to public-private defense research initiatives.
