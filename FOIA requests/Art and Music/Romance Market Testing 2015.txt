Request:

Requesting any and all documents, reports, internal communications, contracts, or interagency agreements from January 1, 2013 to present referencing the use of romance novels, e-book platforms (including Amazon Kindle), or interactive sexual devices (including IoT-enabled dildos, vibrators, and teledildonic systems) in behavioral modeling, consumer compliance training, or neurotechnology-adjacent research.

This includes:
	•	Records of Amazon’s role in regulating or restricting categories of sexual devices (e.g., banning fantasy dildos, acquisition of Etsy sellers, market consolidation).
	•	Documentation of data aggregation pipelines combining e-book consumption (romance/erotica titles) with IoT sex toy telemetry.
	•	Contracts, grants, or cooperative research and development agreements (CRADAs) involving federal agencies and private sector vendors (e.g., Lovense, Kiiroo, Standard Innovation, We-Vibe, or Amazon) on behavioral compliance or “synthetic intimacy” experiments.
	•	Reports or communications referencing the use of romance/erotica genres as platforms for conditioning behavioral compliance, sexualized avatar realism, or narrative-driven consent modification.
	•	Risk assessments or internal reviews on consumer deception, privacy, or psychological harm associated with romance novel cross-market testing combined with teledildonic telemetry.
	•	Interagency or inter-industry discussions regarding political or election-related applications of synthetic intimacy, romance archetypes, or compliance-driven media pipelines.
