Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, research proposals, contractor deliverables, or interagency communications from 1975 to present concerning the use of arbitration or mediation case data for predictive modeling, behavioral analysis, or labor forecasting.

This includes:
	•	Internal studies or commissioned reports analyzing arbitration case outcomes, bargaining patterns, or worker resistance strategies as input for predictive analytics.
	•	Communications between FMCS, AAA, NMB, or DOL and private contractors (including RAND, MITRE, McKinsey, or similar firms) regarding the use of arbitration data for behavioral modeling or futures-style forecasting.
	•	Records discussing whether arbitration or grievance data were shared with other federal agencies (such as the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, or intelligence community) for the purpose of continuity-of-operations planning, workforce resilience modeling, or attrition simulations.
	•	Any ethics reviews, risk assessments, or oversight memos addressing the appropriateness of repurposing arbitration records for behavioral futures markets or predictive labor analytics.
	•	Documentation of pilot programs, workshops, or training modules that referenced arbitration data in connection with market modeling, labor market volatility instruments, or workforce compliance studies.
