Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, research proposals, internal communications, or interagency correspondence from 1997 to present referencing the use of synthetic media, digital doubles, or persona simulation technologies in connection with literary figures or authors with global cultural impact.

This includes:
	•	Research on the use of high-profile author identities as anchors for synthetic persona creation or controlled public communication
	•	Interagency collaborations with UK government agencies, universities, or entertainment firms regarding synthetic media, digital likeness management, or persona simulation in publishing and film
	•	Contracts or cooperative agreements with private vendors, publishers, or film studios concerning synthetic public figures or controlled author branding
	•	Ethical reviews, informed consent protocols, or policy analyses on the substitution of simulated voices or statements for human authors
	•	Studies on audience trust, perception of authenticity, and behavioral influence in the context of public statements by globally recognized authors

Keywords: synthetic media, digital double, simulated persona, author identity, publishing, UK collaboration, voice synthesis, likeness management, behavioral modeling, DARPA, IARPA, NIST

Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, research proposals, interagency communications, vendor agreements, or policy analyses from 1997 to present concerning the use of synthetic or simulated public figures in behavioral modeling, predictive analytics, or behavioral futures markets, particularly in connection with globally recognized authors or cultural figures.

This includes:
	•	Research on using synthetic media or simulated public statements to test parasocial attachment, betrayal tolerance, and identity-based compliance in global audiences
	•	Studies on the deliberate deployment of polarizing or controversial narratives (e.g., gender identity, minority representation) through simulated authors as stress tests of audience loyalty and consumer behavior
	•	Contracts or collaborations with UK-based government agencies, publishers, or media firms regarding persona simulation, controlled branding, or digital doubles of prominent authors
	•	Analyses of market response (book sales, streaming, merchandise, social engagement) to controversial public statements attributed to high-profile authors
	•	Ethical reviews or policy assessments concerning substitution of simulated authors for real individuals, especially where controversy is engineered as a behavioral experiment
	•	Interagency communications or contractor reports cross-referencing cultural controversies with predictive modeling datasets for behavioral futures markets

Keywords: synthetic persona, simulated author, behavioral futures markets, betrayal tolerance, parasocial modeling, compliance stress test, controlled controversy, UK collaboration, DARPA, IARPA, predictive analytics
