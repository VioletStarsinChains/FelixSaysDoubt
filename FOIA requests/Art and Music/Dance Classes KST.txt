To National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) / Department of Education / Department of Defense

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, internal communications, research proposals, or vendor agreements concerning the collection or use of data from dance instruction, rehearsal, or performance spaces for the purpose of kinesthetic style transfer, from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Records of partnerships between federal agencies and arts organizations, dance schools, or universities related to motion capture or kinesthetic modeling
	•	Contracts with technology vendors providing gait analysis, posture recognition, or movement telemetry within dance training environments
	•	Research proposals or pilot programs involving children or adult dancers as subjects for kinesthetic style transfer
	•	Reports assessing cross-domain applications of dance-derived kinesthetic data (e.g., entertainment, robotics, defense training, education)
	•	Communications on privacy, consent, or ethical risks regarding movement data collection in dance education or performance contexts
	•	Internal analyses of dance pedagogy as a structured data environment for reproducible kinesthetic modeling

Keywords: dance data collection, kinesthetic style transfer, gait analysis, posture recognition, motion capture dance, movement telemetry, predictive modeling, dance education surveillance, NEA partnerships, behavioral entrainment
