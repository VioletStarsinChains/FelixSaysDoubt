To: Library of Congress / Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) / National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, contracts, or communications from 1990 to present concerning the digitization of print collections and the development of dynamic or variable content delivery systems for library patrons.

This includes:
	‚Ä¢	Contracts with private vendors (e.g., Amazon, Google, OverDrive) for ebook and digitization services.
	‚Ä¢	Records of pilot projects involving on-demand printing or reconfigurable substrates for books.
	‚Ä¢	Internal communications on the implications of large-scale digitization for public access and archival continuity.
	‚Ä¢	Reports analyzing the effect of ebook adoption on information equity, continuity of collections, and archival trust.

FOIA: Reconfigurable Print Media in Libraries and News Distribution

To: Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), Library of Congress, Federal Communications Commission (FCC), National Science Foundation (NSF ‚Äì Division of Information & Intelligent Systems)

Request:
Requesting any and all contracts, pilot projects, research proposals, or internal communications from 2000 to present concerning the development and deployment of reconfigurable print media for public distribution, including books, newspapers, and library collections.

This includes:
	‚Ä¢	Records of government-funded research or vendor contracts for print substrates capable of dynamic content updates (e.g., e-ink hybrids, AR-enabled surfaces).
	‚Ä¢	Communications regarding partnerships with publishers, distributors, or technology companies (e.g., Amazon, Google, large newspaper syndicates) on experimental or adaptive print systems.
	‚Ä¢	Reports analyzing the use of dynamic print media in public libraries, little free libraries, and newspaper circulation systems.
	‚Ä¢	Internal discussions of risks, ethics, or public perception tied to altering or dynamically refreshing physical media content.

Keywords: reconfigurable print media, adaptive book substrates, dynamic newspapers, e-ink hybrids, AR-enabled surfaces, continuity of collections, public information access

üìÑ Spicy FOIA: Adaptive Book Substrates as Behavioral Entrainment Vectors

To: Department of Defense (DARPA ‚Äì Information Innovation Office), Department of Homeland Security (Office of Science and Technology), National Science Foundation (NSF ‚Äì Division of Information & Intelligent Systems)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, contracts, research proposals, or internal communications from 2000 to present concerning the use of adaptive book substrates, ebook projection systems, or variable-content print materials as part of continuity management, behavioral entrainment, or simulation environments.

This includes:
	‚Ä¢	Research on substrates capable of receiving projected, AR, or networked overlays to dynamically alter visible book content.
	‚Ä¢	Contracts with private-sector vendors (Amazon, Google, major publishing distributors) to develop or test adaptive print/e-ink hybrid systems.
	‚Ä¢	Reports or communications regarding the use of physical library systems (including ‚Äúlittle free libraries‚Äù) as continuity anchors or environmental entrainment nodes.
	‚Ä¢	Ethical reviews or oversight documents discussing the implications of altering visible book content for targeted individuals or populations.
