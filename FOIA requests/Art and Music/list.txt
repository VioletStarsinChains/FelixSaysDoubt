Request:

Requesting any and all records, training materials, research, procurement, contracts, internal communications, and media-monitoring products referencing the use of fictional works by Chuck Palahniuk in intelligence, law‑enforcement, military, or contractor contexts from 1995 to present. This includes titles such as Invisible Monsters, Fight Club, Survivor, Diary, Haunted, Rant, Lullaby, and Choke, especially where these works are cited in relation to identity erasure, persona reconstruction, narrative control, or classifications analogous to “Non‑Person Entity (NPE).”

This includes:
• Syllabi, lesson plans, bibliographies, reading lists, JTTP/JSOU/FLETC course materials, or training slide decks that cite any Palahniuk work
• Research memos, white papers, concept notes, or after‑action reports analyzing identity destruction/reconstruction, narrative management, or de‑personing using Palahniuk as a case study
• Media monitoring, OSINT, or cultural forecasting products referencing Palahniuk in connection with psychological operations, behavior modeling, or target profiling
• Internal emails, chats, taskers, SharePoint/Confluence pages, or ticketing items discussing Palahniuk works for training or policy development
• Contracts, NDAs, SOWs, invoices, purchase orders, or licensing related to acquiring Palahniuk titles for training or analysis (including e‑book/DRM licenses)
• References to Palahniuk in glossaries, doctrine, or policy—particularly where terms such as NPE, de‑personing, identity laundering, or narrative containment appear
