Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, communications, research proposals, or technical deployment records relating to the use of biometric, physiological, or behavioral data collection technologies at Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour events between March 2023 and December 2023, particularly during shows in which attendees experienced dangerous heat conditions, including but not limited to:
	•	Phoenix, Arizona (March 17–18, 2023)
	•	Nashville, Tennessee (May 5–7, 2023)
	•	Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (November 17–19, 2023)

This includes:
	•	Internal planning documents, risk assessments, or operational orders concerning environmental stress conditions and anticipated physiological effects on attendees
	•	Contracts, purchase orders, or deployment logs for crowd telemetry, remote biometric sensing, thermal imaging, acoustic beamforming, or geofencing systems
	•	Data collection protocols, anonymization procedures, or pattern-of-life analyses related to audience members during these events
	•	Interagency communications regarding health incidents (heat stroke, dehydration, cardiac arrest) and any concurrent biometric or behavioral monitoring activities
	•	After-action reports, post-event summaries, or evaluations noting correlations between environmental stress and data quality or subject compliance
