To Department of Homeland Security (DHS) / Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) / Department of Defense (DoD) / Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, reports, interagency communications, contractor analyses, or research proposals from 2012 to present concerning the observation, evaluation, or study of DashCon 2014 (a fan convention originally organized around Tumblr communities) as a case study in group behavior, social stress testing, or attrition simulation.

This includes:
	•	Records analyzing crowd behavior, crisis response, and resource scarcity during DashCon 2014, including the widely publicized “ball pit incident.”
	•	Internal or contractor reports treating DashCon as a model of emergent group dynamics under conditions of logistical failure.
	•	Communications between DHS, FBI, DoD, or DARPA regarding the use of online fan communities as experimental populations for real-world social stress simulations.
	•	Research proposals or pilot programs referencing DashCon as an attrition environment—including themes of expectation collapse, resource withdrawal, and participant coping strategies.
	•	Oversight reviews or adverse event reports documenting psychological, behavioral, or economic impacts on attendees in connection with simulation methodologies.
	•	Contractor or academic partnerships examining DashCon as an experimental setting for continuity of community structures when institutional support fails.

To National Institutes of Health (NIH) / National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, research proposals, grant applications, interagency communications, or contractor analyses from 2012 to present referencing DashCon 2014 (a fan convention organized around Tumblr communities) as a case study in group psychology, social stress testing, or behavioral collapse under conditions of unmet expectations.

This includes:
	•	Research proposals or funded projects examining fan convention settings as environments for social stress testing, group identity under strain, or attrition-like conditions.
	•	Records analyzing the psychological and behavioral impact of sudden withdrawal of promised resources (e.g., venue access, programming, event financing) on attendees.
	•	Internal or academic reports treating DashCon as an example of expectation collapse leading to altered group cohesion or coping behaviors.
	•	Communications between NIH/NIMH and other agencies (DHS, DARPA, DoD) concerning convention environments as stress laboratories for studying human behavior.
	•	Documentation of participant mental health outcomes (short-term or long-term) linked to high-profile event collapse scenarios.
