Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, research proposals, interagency communications, vendor agreements, or policy analyses from 2000 to present concerning the use of simulated or synthetic performers in behavioral modeling, predictive analytics, or behavioral futures markets, with particular attention to audience loyalty stress tests in the global music industry.

This includes:
	•	Research or pilot programs testing parasocial attachment, betrayal tolerance, and consumer compliance through simulated celebrity figures (e.g., faceless or proxy performers such as Sia)
	•	Studies evaluating how audiences respond to the withholding of formulaic content or deliberate disruption of hit-making patterns (e.g., Rihanna’s Anti album)
	•	Interagency communications or contracts with entertainment firms measuring the balance between synthetic compliance anchors and resistant authenticity plays
	•	Analyses of streaming, ticketing, merchandise, or social media engagement data in relation to controversial or experimental artist rollouts
	•	Ethical reviews, informed consent protocols, or risk assessments tied to engineered cultural controversies or authenticity withdrawal as a behavioral experiment
	•	Cross-referencing of audience response datasets with predictive modeling or behavioral futures markets infrastructure
