Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, research proposals, vendor agreements, internal communications, or interagency correspondence from 2000 to present referencing the development, deployment, or evaluation of synthetic media or persona simulation technologies where the identity of an existing songwriter, producer, or behind-the-scenes artist was used as the basis for a public-facing celebrity construct.

This includes:
	•	Research on the use of songwriter or “ghostwriter” identities as anchors for synthetic persona creation in the entertainment industry
	•	Interagency communications or cooperative agreements with Australian government agencies, universities, or contractors relating to persona simulation, digital doubles, or voice modeling in music and performance contexts
	•	Contracts or pilot programs involving the substitution of simulated performers for real individuals, particularly in cases where the real person was located outside the United States
	•	Ethical reviews, informed consent protocols, or policy analyses concerning the use of an individual’s likeness, name, or professional reputation in synthetic media deployments without their direct participation
	•	Studies on audience perception, parasocial attachment, or compliance behavior in relation to simulated performers with obscured or withheld identity markers

Keywords: synthetic persona, digital double, simulated performer, songwriter identity, ghostwriter, Australia collaboration, voice synthesis, likeness management, behavioral modeling, DARPA, IARPA, NIST

Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, research proposals, interagency communications, vendor agreements, or policy analyses from 2000 to present concerning the use of simulated or synthetic performers in behavioral modeling, predictive analytics, or behavioral futures markets, particularly where an existing songwriter identity was used as the cover or anchor for the public-facing persona.

This includes:
	•	Research or pilot programs testing parasocial attachment, betrayal tolerance, and audience compliance by introducing inflammatory statements or controversial narratives (e.g., disability representation, autism discourse) through a simulated celebrity figure
	•	Contracts or cooperative agreements with Australian government agencies, universities, or entertainment firms regarding persona simulation, digital doubles, or synthetic voice modeling of songwriters or ghostwriters
	•	Studies evaluating how audiences respond to perceived authenticity, betrayal, or controversy when loyalty to a performer has already been established
	•	Interagency communications regarding the use of Australian-based songwriters or producers as “low-visibility anchors” for synthetic media deployments in U.S. and international markets
	•	Ethical or policy reviews concerning the substitution of simulated performers for real individuals, particularly where those individuals had no direct awareness or participation
	•	Analyses of market response data (streaming, ticketing, merchandise, social engagement) correlated with controlled persona rollouts involving reputational stressors or authenticity challenges
