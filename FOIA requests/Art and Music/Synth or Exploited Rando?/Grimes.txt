Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, research proposals, grant reports, or interagency communications from 2010 to present referencing collaborations between artists, musicians, or entertainment firms and federally funded programs on artificial intelligence, neural interfaces, or voice synthesis technologies.

This includes:
	•	Research on artist partnerships for AI-based voice modeling, digital doubles, or persona simulation in music and performance
	•	Contracts with music labels, production companies, or individual artists for projects involving synthetic voice or likeness replication
	•	Studies on cultural perception of AI-assisted creativity and audience trust in synthetic art forms
	•	Interagency or contractor reports on the use of music and entertainment collaborations to accelerate public acceptance of AI/neurotechnology

Keywords: AI music collaboration, synthetic voice, digital double, neural interface, entertainment partnership, artist collaboration, DARPA, IARPA, NIST

Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, research proposals, vendor agreements, or interagency communications from 2010 to present concerning the use of artist collaborations with AI, neurotechnology, or persona simulation systems in behavioral modeling, predictive analytics, or behavioral futures markets.

This includes:
	•	Programs or pilot projects testing parasocial attachment, betrayal tolerance, and consumer compliance through artists positioned as public advocates of AI/neurotechnology (e.g., partnerships involving Grimes or similar figures)
	•	Research on the use of hidden data sources or lived-experience “ghostwriting” datasets to build cultural simulations later attributed to public-facing artists
	•	Studies comparing audience responses to obscured or faceless performers (e.g., Sia) versus synthetic-leaning performers openly associated with AI/neurotech (e.g., Grimes)
	•	Analyses of market response data (streaming, merchandise, social engagement) cross-referenced with engineered controversies or authenticity withdrawals tied to AI-assisted artists
	•	Ethical reviews, informed consent protocols, or policy discussions concerning the exploitation of invisible contributors as the hidden basis for synthetic public personas

Keywords: synthetic persona, ghostwriter dataset, behavioral futures markets, parasocial modeling, betrayal tolerance, AI music collaboration, Grimes, Sia, neural interface, predictive analytics, DARPA, IARPA
