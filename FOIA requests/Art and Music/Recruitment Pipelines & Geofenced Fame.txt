Request:

Requesting any and all documents, reports, internal communications, or contractor deliverables from January 1, 2005 to present regarding the use of geofencing, algorithmic content restriction, or targeted amplification in the careers of cultural figures (e.g., musicians, actors, authors) for the purposes of recruitment, behavioral influence, or operational control in intelligence, military, or security contexts.

This includes:
	•	Analyses of cultural production industries as recruitment pools or influence vectors for intelligence or surveillance-adjacent work
	•	Studies or models assessing the effect of geographically limited exposure (“geofenced fame”) on decision-making, political alignment, or operational compliance of cultural figures
	•	Programs designed to selectively amplify or suppress the careers of musicians, actors, or other public figures to shape their behavior, restrict dissent, or encourage cooperation
	•	Contractor or academic research into audience shaping as a tool for reinforcing operational security, narrative control, or talent acquisition
	•	Joint agency–contractor meetings, presentations, or reports discussing cultural influence campaigns based on location-based targeting
	•	Internal ethics reviews, legal assessments, or policy documents relating to the use of geofencing or targeted content delivery in cultural production for recruitment or control purposes

Keywords: geofenced fame, cultural influence operations, talent pipeline, audience shaping, algorithmic amplification, targeted suppression, recruitment psychology, operational compliance, narrative control, behavioral influence, cultural production
