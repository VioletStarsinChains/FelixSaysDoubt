Request:

Requesting any and all documents, internal communications, research proposals, training materials, or incident reports regarding the creation, simulation, or exploitation of geological or structural instabilities as part of behavioral influence, crowd control, or political operations, from 1980 to present.

This includes:
	•	Engineering or inducement of sinkholes, subsidence, landslides, ice shelf collapses, or similar events in populated or high-traffic areas.
	•	Use of flooding, mine collapse, tunnel breach, or other structural failures to redirect civilian movement or impede access to locations.
	•	Application of perceptual manipulation technologies (e.g., synthetic hallucinations, AR overlays, false affordances) to conceal hazards or create the illusion of safe passage in hazardous zones.
	•	Integration of geological hazard creation with psychological operations (PSYOP) or crowd dispersal tactics.
	•	Risk assessments on public safety related to deliberate or simulated environmental accidents.
	•	Contracts, grants, or partnerships with private or academic entities researching environmental hazards as a control mechanism.

Keywords: engineered collapse, sinkhole inducement, subsidence operations, ice shelf destabilization, false affordance, synthetic hallucination, environmental PSYOP, hazard perception manipulation, behavioral control, infrastructure sabotage, controlled demolition, void creation
