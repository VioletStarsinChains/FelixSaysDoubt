To: Department of Energy / Department of Defense / Department of Homeland Security / Federal Emergency Management Agency

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, research proposals, or internal communications from 1995 to 2005 regarding the use of gravity modulation or proxy technologies (air pressure, airflow systems, infrasound) in the context of emergency management, homeland security exercises, or structural resilience studies.

This includes:
	•	Reports on the potential for minor gravity fluctuations to affect structural stability or load distribution in high-rise or critical infrastructure
	•	Research into human physiological or behavioral responses (e.g., dizziness, collapse, disorientation) under experimental gravity modulation conditions
	•	Contracts or proposals exploring the substitution of airflow/air curtain systems as proxies for gravity modulation in large-scale exercises
	•	Risk/benefit assessments of deploying gravity modulation in live emergency scenarios, drills, or simulations

Keywords: gravity modulation, proxy airflow, structural resilience, emergency exercise, disorientation, vestibular effects, behavioral futures, critical infrastructure, homeland security, resilience testing
