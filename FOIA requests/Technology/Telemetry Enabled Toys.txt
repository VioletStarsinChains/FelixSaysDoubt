Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, regulatory filings, interagency agreements, or vendor contracts referencing the development, testing, or monitoring of consumer sexual devices (e.g., vibrators, dildos, smart toys) with embedded telemetry, signal relay, or haptic feedback functions potentially linked to behavioral or compliance studies, from January 1, 2005 to present.

This includes:
	•	Records of wireless, Bluetooth, or USB-enabled sexual devices evaluated for safety, data collection, or secondary uses in research contexts
	•	Correspondence between federal agencies and private vendors regarding sensor integration, data extraction, or relay functions in consumer sexual devices
	•	Reports on neural entrainment, compliance anchoring, or artificial body ownership phenomena induced by use of such devices
	•	Ethical reviews, adverse event reports, or consumer safety assessments connected to telemetry-enabled sexual devices
	•	Interagency communications on the intersection of consumer devices, neurotechnology, and behavioral futures markets
	•	Export controls, foreign partnership documentation, or technology transfer records tied to telemetry-enabled consumer sexual products

Keywords: smart sex toy, vibrator telemetry, consumer neurotech, artificial body ownership, compliance anchoring, sensory relay, behavioral futures, DARPA, CDRH
