FOIA – Consumer Safety & EMF Emissions

To: Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) / Federal Communications Commission (FCC)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, reports, contracts, or interagency communications from 2010 to present concerning consumer safety assessments, electromagnetic emissions testing, or hazard investigations involving portable automotive battery jump starters.

This includes:
	•	Records of EMF or RF leakage testing on lithium-ion powered jump packs and portable battery boosters
	•	Reports on overheating, off-gassing, or chemical exposure associated with jump starter battery chemistry
	•	Contracts with private labs or vendors for testing entrainment-related variables such as strobing LEDs, audible alarms, or pulsed discharge effects
	•	Internal analyses describing potential neurological, cardiovascular, or sensory impacts of proximity to jump starters during operation

Keywords: battery jump starter, portable booster pack, EMF emissions, RF leakage, lithium-ion hazard, LED strobe safety, CPSC, FCC, consumer electronics testing

FOIA (Spicy Angle – Entrainment & Compliance Testing)

To: Department of Defense (DoD) / Department of Homeland Security (DHS) / Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, contracts, communications, or internal analyses from 2010 to present concerning the use of portable automotive battery jump starters or similar high-discharge consumer devices as platforms for entrainment, compliance testing, or behavioral futures research.

This includes:
	•	Records describing jump starter discharge pulses, EMF emissions, or LED modulation as tools for cognitive entrainment or autonomic nervous system regulation
	•	Contracts with defense contractors, universities, or private vendors to evaluate consumer jump starters as portable testbeds for stress-induced compliance
	•	Reports connecting stalled vehicles and jump starter use to behavioral modeling scenarios or civilian stress-response testing
	•	Internal analyses linking widespread civilian distribution of jump packs to decentralized entrainment platforms or compliance-experiment networks

Keywords: battery jump starter, entrainment technology, compliance testing, behavioral futures, EMF discharge, DARPA, DHS, DoD, portable signal platform
