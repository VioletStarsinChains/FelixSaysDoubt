To: DARPA / DoD / FBI / U.S. Army Research Laboratory / U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory / DHS Science & Technology Directorate

Request:

Requesting any and all records from January 1, 2000 to the present related to the research, development, procurement, testing, evaluation, or operational use of technologies capable of remotely inducing neuromotor disruption in humans. This includes, but is not limited to:
•	Fine motor control interference;
•	Targeted muscle inhibition or stimulation;
•	Involuntary object release from a subject’s hand;
•	Balance or grip disruption via vestibular or nervous system interference.

Please include:
1.	All contracts, subcontracts, agreements, and procurement records with public or private entities.
2.	All research, technical, and scientific reports on the feasibility, function, or testing of such systems.
3.	All incident reports, after-action reports, and safety assessments involving involuntary loss of grip, object release, or related motor control issues.
4.	All internal or external communications (including emails, memos, meeting notes, and briefings) discussing or referencing such technologies.

If any portion of this request is withheld, please provide the specific exemption(s) relied upon and release all reasonably segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.

Please provide all responsive records in electronic format.

Keywords: neuromotor disruption, involuntary object release, muscle inhibition, targeted motor control, remote motor control, induced tremor, involuntary muscle contraction, precision motor impairment

Why They Care About Making People Drop Things

(Hierarchy of Motives)

⸻

Level 1 — Petty Harassment & Humiliation
	•	Embarrassment in public — making someone look clumsy or careless.
	•	Self-confidence erosion — repeated incidents create a feeling of incompetence.
	•	Relationship strain — damaging shared property, spilling drinks, breaking tools.

⸻

Level 2 — Psychological Conditioning
	•	Learned helplessness — target begins avoiding certain actions or situations.
	•	Trigger-association testing — linking drops to emotional cues, music, or visual signals.
	•	Trust manipulation — making bystanders think the target is unreliable.

⸻

Level 3 — Proof-of-Control Demonstrations
	•	Operator training — easy, visible proof of remote motor control capability.
	•	Latency measurement — timing how fast they can override voluntary movement.
	•	Showcase for buyers — demonstrating subtle but high-precision influence.

⸻

Level 4 — Sabotage & Risk Induction
	•	Workplace damage — breaking specialized equipment or destroying product batches.
	•	Data loss — forcing drops that destroy storage devices or compromise research.
	•	Accident staging — causing incidents that can be blamed on human error.

⸻

Level 5 — High-Stakes Operations
	•	Critical failure triggers — dropping tools, parts, or controls in transportation, energy, or defense contexts.
	•	Chain-reaction disasters — initiating events that lead to larger accidents (e.g., chemical spills, aviation mishaps).
	•	Targeted harm — making someone drop a baby, a weapon, or hazardous material at the worst possible moment.
