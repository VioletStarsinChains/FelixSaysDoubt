To: Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) / Federal Communications Commission (FCC) / Food and Drug Administration (FDA – Center for Devices and Radiological Health)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, reports, contracts, or interagency communications from 2000 to present concerning electromagnetic emissions, sensory effects, or potential neurological impacts of consumer electronic devices, including but not limited to portable battery packs, automated external defibrillators (AEDs), household appliances, and personal electronics.

This includes:
	•	Records of EMF, RF, or pulsed discharge testing on consumer devices and accessories
	•	Reports on physiological or neurological side effects of exposure to emissions from consumer electronics in everyday environments
	•	Contracts with universities, private labs, or vendors conducting safety testing related to entrainment-like variables (pulsed light, sound, vibration, or EMF exposure)
	•	Internal analyses describing potential public health risks linked to proximity or regular use of such devices

Keywords: consumer electronics, EMF emissions, RF leakage, neurological effects, pulsed discharge, LED strobe safety, AED, battery pack, CPSC, FCC, FDA

FOIA (Spicy Angle – Consumer Electronics as Entrainment Platforms)

To: Department of Defense (DoD) / Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) / Department of Homeland Security (DHS)

Request:
Requesting any and all documents, contracts, communications, or internal analyses from 2000 to present concerning the use of consumer electronic devices as platforms for entrainment, compliance testing, or behavioral futures modeling.

This includes:
	•	Records describing use of EMF emissions, pulsed discharge, strobing LEDs, or audio modulation from consumer devices for cognitive or autonomic nervous system entrainment
	•	Contracts with defense contractors, universities, or private vendors to evaluate consumer electronics as distributed entrainment or compliance-testing nodes
	•	Reports linking everyday consumer devices to population-level behavioral modeling, synthetic population stabilization, or continuity-of-operations research
	•	Analyses of aggregated consumer electronics as a civilian entrainment environment supporting predictive analytics and behavioral futures markets

Keywords: consumer electronics, entrainment technology, compliance testing, behavioral futures, EMF discharge, DARPA, DHS, DoD, synthetic population, population entrainment
