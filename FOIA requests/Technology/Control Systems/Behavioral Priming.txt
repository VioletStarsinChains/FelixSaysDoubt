Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, contracts, internal communications, or technical reports regarding the use of harmonic frequency patterns in neural entrainment or brain–computer interface systems from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Studies on neural oscillation entrainment using harmonic multiples of a base stimulation frequency
	•	Research on triadic, hexagonal, or 9-node network topologies in neural or neuromorphic systems
	•	Protocols involving multi-tiered control loops with stimulus intervals at harmonic timings (e.g., 3, 6, 9 seconds)
	•	Modeling or simulations applying power-law or harmonic scaling to spike timing or amplitude control
	•	Applications of harmonic entrainment in behavioral modification, cognitive enhancement, or decision-making contexts
	•	Covert or operational testing of harmonic rhythmic cues for subconscious behavioral influence
	•	Contracts or collaborations with private companies, universities, or foreign entities studying harmonic timing effects in neurostimulation

Keywords: neural entrainment, harmonic frequency, triadic network, hexagonal topology, 3 Hz stimulation, 6 Hz stimulation, 9 Hz stimulation, rhythmic priming, behavioral timing, harmonic scaling
