To Federal Communications Commission (FCC) / Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) / National Security Agency (NSA) / Department of Defense (DoD)

Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, internal communications, technical evaluations, vendor contracts, or interagency memoranda from 2000 to present concerning the use of cell phone ringtones, vibration alerts, or notification patterns as potential entrainment vectors or behavioral influence tools.

This includes:
	•	Records of federally funded or contractor-led studies examining the effects of repetitive tones, frequencies, rhythms, or vibration sequences on cognition, attention, mood, or compliance.
	•	Documents concerning the classification of acoustic or haptic notification patterns as potential neuromodulatory or entrainment mechanisms.
	•	Oversight reviews or program summaries addressing dual-use applications of ringtone/vibration research (consumer usability vs. behavioral conditioning).
	•	Contracts, grants, or proposals involving mobile device manufacturers (e.g., Apple, Samsung, Motorola, Nokia) regarding notification design, human factors testing, or entrainment effects.
	•	Interagency communications (FCC, DARPA, NSA, DoD) about the standardization of notification frequencies/patterns and their potential impact on human populations.
	•	Any adverse event or consumer safety reports referencing neurological or physiological responses to ringtones, vibration patterns, or notification alerts.
