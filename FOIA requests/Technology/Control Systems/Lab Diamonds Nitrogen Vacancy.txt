Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, research proposals, interagency communications, vendor agreements, or policy assessments from 2005 to present concerning the use of diamond materials — specifically nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center diamonds and other engineered diamond defects — in neurotechnology research, brain-computer interfaces, or behavioral modeling applications.

This includes:
	•	Research on NV-diamond quantum sensors for mapping neural activity, magnetic resonance imaging enhancement, or high-resolution electrophysiology
	•	Pilot programs investigating diamond-based biosensors for non-invasive neural monitoring, brain-computer interfaces, or cognitive state detection
	•	Interagency communications on the dual-use potential of engineered diamonds in both biomedical research and covert monitoring applications
	•	Contracts with universities, laboratories, or private-sector manufacturers specializing in synthetic diamond growth and defect engineering for neurotech purposes
	•	Studies linking diamond-based neurotech research to behavioral prediction, arousal regulation, or compliance modeling
	•	Ethical reviews or policy discussions on the use of diamond substrates as wearable, implantable, or consumer-facing neurotechnology platforms

Keywords: nitrogen-vacancy diamond, NV center, quantum sensor, synthetic diamond neurotech, brain-computer interface, neural signal amplifier, behavioral modeling, DARPA, IARPA, NIST

Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, vendor agreements, interagency communications, or policy reviews from 2005 to present concerning the covert or dual-use application of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center diamonds, synthetic gemstones, or diamond-like carbon structures embedded in consumer products (including jewelry) as neurotechnology interfaces, signal amplifiers, or behavioral entrainment vectors.

This includes:
	•	Research or pilot programs embedding NV-diamond or other engineered diamond defects in jewelry (e.g., wedding rings, pendants, piercings) for use as covert neurotech sensors or amplifiers
	•	Studies correlating jewelry-based entrainment anchors with cognitive modulation, arousal regulation, or consumer compliance data
	•	Interagency communications regarding collaborations with jewelry manufacturers, synthetic diamond growers, or online platforms (e.g., Etsy, eBay, Amazon) for distribution of diamond-based neurotech
	•	Analyses of NV-diamond jewelry as dual-use platforms: simultaneously symbolic compliance anchors (ritual objects) and covert neurotech receivers/transmitters
	•	Reports on “illusory” gemstone products (items that never ship, disappear, or are counterfeit) as probes for betrayal tolerance and predictive modeling of consumer response
	•	Ethical reviews, risk assessments, or policy discussions concerning undisclosed neurotech embedded in ritual adornments and consumer jewelry

Keywords: NV-diamond jewelry, synthetic gemstone neurotech, nitrogen-vacancy centers, covert sensor, arousal regulation, entrainment anchor, behavioral futures markets, Etsy, eBay
