Request:

Requesting any and all records, reports, investigations, contracts, compliance audits, interagency correspondence, or disciplinary actions from January 1, 2005, to present regarding the use, misuse, compromise, or trafficking of access to neurotechnology systems capable of directly influencing, modulating, or controlling human motor, sensory, or autonomic functions.

This request specifically includes incidents in which:
	•	Individuals’ neurotechnology arrays or neural interface devices were accessed without their consent for the purpose of initiating sexual contact, simulating sexual activity, or inducing sexual arousal or bodily exposure.
	•	Access to such systems was sold, traded, gifted, or otherwise transferred to unauthorized parties — including employees, contractors, subcontractors, or external actors — for purposes of sexual gratification, coercion, or blackmail.
	•	Remote operators intentionally caused targets to perform sexualized actions or expose themselves through induced motor control or behavioral prompting without the target’s awareness of external influence.
	•	Internal or external cybersecurity breaches allowed unauthorized parties to gain control of neurotech arrays for sexual or erotic purposes.
	•	Interagency or contractor communications referenced these incidents as “perks,” “fringe benefits,” “leverage,” “control vectors,” or equivalent euphemisms.

This request also seeks:
	•	Policies, guidelines, or technical documentation regarding the prevention, detection, or remediation of neurotech-enabled sexual exploitation or trafficking.
	•	Risk assessments, vulnerability reports, or penetration testing results identifying ways neurotech systems could be misused for sexual contact or trafficking.

Keywords: neurotechnology exploitation, neural interface compromise, non-consensual motor control, sexual contact simulation, neurotech trafficking, array compromise, unauthorized control access, behavioral manipulation, sexualized coercion, human–machine interface breach.

To: [State] Attorney General – Human Trafficking Division / [State] Department of Public Safety – Criminal Investigations / [State] Department of Justice – Special Prosecutions / [State] Anti-Human Trafficking Task Force

Request:

Requesting any and all complaints, investigation files, case records, task force reports, interagency correspondence, or enforcement actions from January 1, 2005, to present concerning incidents in which any person, company, or contractor obtained, sold, transferred, or misused remote access to an individual’s body via a technological interface for the purpose of:
	•	Inducing sexual arousal, simulating sexual contact, or causing sexual exposure without the knowledge or consent of the individual affected.
	•	Coercing or compelling an individual to perform sexual acts, gestures, or displays through the use of involuntary motor control, sensory manipulation, or other remote physiological influence.
	•	Selling, trading, or otherwise providing access to such control as part of a commercial arrangement, coercive relationship, or trafficking network.
	•	Using technological means to override an individual’s bodily autonomy in order to create sexualized imagery, video, or livestream content.

This includes, but is not limited to:
	•	Cybersecurity breach reports or forensic investigations documenting unauthorized remote control of motor, sensory, or autonomic functions for sexual purposes.
	•	Complaints from victims or third parties alleging that their bodies were remotely manipulated or controlled for sexual exploitation.
	•	Task force or law enforcement communications identifying this behavior as a form of technology-facilitated human trafficking or sexual abuse.
	•	Prosecutions, settlements, or declined prosecutions in cases involving non-consensual bodily control for sexual purposes, whether or not the victim was aware of the mechanism used.

Keywords: technology-facilitated trafficking, remote bodily control, sexual exploitation, non-consensual sexual contact, physiological override, cyber sexual abuse, neurotechnology abuse, trafficking via technological interface, involuntary motor control.
