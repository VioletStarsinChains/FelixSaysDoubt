Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, regulatory filings, interagency agreements, or vendor contracts referencing the development, testing, or monitoring of consumer sexual devices (e.g., vibrators, dildos, smart toys) with embedded telemetry, signal relay, or haptic feedback functions potentially linked to behavioral or compliance studies, from January 1, 2005 to present.

This includes:
	•	Records of wireless, Bluetooth, or USB-enabled sexual devices evaluated for safety, data collection, or secondary uses in research contexts
	•	Correspondence between federal agencies and private vendors regarding sensor integration, data extraction, or relay functions in consumer sexual devices
	•	Reports on neural entrainment, compliance anchoring, or artificial body ownership phenomena induced by use of such devices
	•	Ethical reviews, adverse event reports, or consumer safety assessments connected to telemetry-enabled sexual devices
	•	Interagency communications on the intersection of consumer devices, neurotechnology, and behavioral futures markets
	•	Export controls, foreign partnership documentation, or technology transfer records tied to telemetry-enabled consumer sexual products

Keywords: smart sex toy, vibrator telemetry, consumer neurotech, artificial body ownership, compliance anchoring, sensory relay, behavioral futures, DARPA, CDRH

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, internal communications, regulatory filings, or interagency agreements referencing the manufacture, regulation, or market restriction of sexual devices with embedded sensors, telemetry modules, or relay hardware, from January 1, 2008 to present.

This includes:
	•	Communications between the FDA, FTC, and major e-commerce platforms (Amazon, Etsy) regarding restrictions or bans on sexual device categories (e.g., fantasy toys, independent vendor products)
	•	Technical documentation or vendor submissions describing wireless connectivity, sensory-feedback, or data-transmission features in sexual wellness devices
	•	Records related to compliance testing, safety reviews, or consumer protection enforcement where telemetry or remote relay functions were identified in these products
	•	Interagency or platform-level discussions on controlling independent supply chains versus centralized fulfillment networks for sexual devices
	•	Reports or assessments concerning the use of consumer-grade sexual devices as relays in neurotechnology-linked behavioral modeling or compliance research
	•	Internal evaluations on the implications of restricting non-networked or hand-manufactured devices from the consumer marketplace
	•	Export controls, foreign partnership documentation, or technology transfer records concerning smart sexual devices
