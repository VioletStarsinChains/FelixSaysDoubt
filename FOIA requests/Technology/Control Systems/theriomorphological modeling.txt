	•	German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI)
	•	Fraunhofer Society, IAIS (Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems)

This includes:
	•	Contracts, agreements, or joint projects concerning anomaly detection, out-of-distribution recognition, or behavioral prediction systems.
	•	Technical manuals, datasets, or training materials exchanged between U.S. agencies/contractors and the above institutions.
	•	Records of workshops, conferences, or consortia in which anomaly/NPE classification was discussed in collaboration with these institutions.
	•	Communications referencing the application of cross-species cognitive models or mythological archetypes (e.g., unicorn, gnome, tanuki) in the context of anomaly detection.
	•	Oversight reports or risk assessments acknowledging ethical or legal concerns regarding such collaborations.
