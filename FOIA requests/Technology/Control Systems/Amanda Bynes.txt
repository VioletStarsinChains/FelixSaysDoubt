Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, interagency communications, or research proposals from 1990 to present regarding the use of synthetic media, augmented reality, or targeted perceptual manipulation in the portrayal of public figures — particularly child or teen celebrities — for behavioral research or predictive modeling purposes.

This includes but is not limited to:
	•	Studies or pilot programs examining the deliberate induction, simulation, or amplification of “public breakdown” narratives in high-profile youth celebrities (e.g., Amanda Bynes, Britney Spears, Lindsay Lohan).
	•	Documentation on the use of augmented reality (AR), synthetic hallucinations, or digital media alteration to influence how audiences perceived such breakdowns.
	•	Communications with entertainment industry stakeholders, PR firms, or celebrity management entities concerning behavioral data collection tied to media coverage of breakdown events.
	•	Oversight reports or contractor deliverables evaluating the predictive power of celebrity scandal cycles for consumer behavior, mental health outcomes, or public compliance trends.
	•	Records analyzing correlations between manipulated celebrity narratives and the shaping of generational attitudes toward mental illness, autonomy, and authority.

Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, interagency communications, or research proposals from 1990 to present regarding the use of fabricated or synthetic evidence (including manipulated digital media, synthetic kompromat, or augmented reality injections) to justify or reinforce legal conservatorships of public figures.

This includes but is not limited to:
	•	Documents concerning the designation of individuals under conservatorship as “non-person entities” (NPEs) for the purpose of data use, predictive modeling, or intellectual property exploitation.
	•	Communications between federal agencies, entertainment industry representatives, or private contractors regarding the collection or use of celebrity creative output under conservatorship without their direct consent.
	•	Oversight reports on synthetic media techniques deployed to create the appearance of instability, misconduct, or incapacity in order to initiate or maintain a conservatorship.
	•	Analyses of behavioral outcomes related to public perception of high-profile conservatorship cases, especially in relation to compliance training or parasocial influence.
	•	Proposals or contractor deliverables exploring the use of conservatorships as a legal framework for stripping recourse from exploited individuals, particularly those whose likeness, output, or narrative carries significant market value.

Keywords: synthetic kompromat, legal conservatorship manipulation, non-person entity designation, celebrity exploitation framework, coerced incapacitation, IP expropriation, behavioral futures markets, synthetic instability narrative.
