To DARPA / Department of Defense / Department of Energy

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, reports, internal communications, technical evaluations, or vendor contracts referencing the generation of static or electrostatic fields by neurotechnology arrays or related brain–computer interface systems, from 1975 to present.

This includes:
	•	Studies or incident reports on large-scale arrays creating measurable electrostatic fields in operational environments
	•	Testing protocols for static field thresholds in neural interface or behavioral entrainment applications
	•	Safety evaluations of corona discharge, arcing, or perceptual barrier (“invisible wall”) effects in neurotech test facilities
	•	Communications with contractors or academic labs regarding static field management in neurotech substrates (e.g., polymer films, flexible arrays, dielectric coatings)
	•	Modeling of human behavioral responses (startle, hesitation, avoidance) to field gradients generated by array systems
	•	Documentation comparing industrial-scale static field incidents (e.g., plastics/film manufacturing) to neurotech deployments

Keywords: neurotech arrays, static field, electrostatic barrier, corona discharge, invisible wall, behavioral entrainment, dielectric substrate, triboelectric effect, BCI safety, field gradient perception

To NIH / NIMH / NSF

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, internal communications, or funded project records related to the generation of static or electrostatic fields by neurotechnology arrays, brain–computer interfaces, or other cognitive research apparatus, from 1975 to present.

This includes:
	•	Laboratory studies examining cognitive or behavioral effects of static or electrostatic field gradients
	•	Proposals modeling human hesitation, avoidance, or motor inhibition in response to strong static fields (“invisible wall” phenomena)
	•	Reports comparing industrial electrostatic incidents (e.g., plastic film plants, high-voltage dielectric environments) with neurotechnology or neuroscience research conditions
	•	Safety evaluations of neural recording/stimulation equipment for unintended electrostatic barrier or corona discharge effects
	•	Communications with academic or commercial partners regarding electrostatic management in large-scale or distributed neurotech arrays
	•	Research connecting field exposure to memory, bias, or perception thresholds in human or animal studies

Keywords: static field, electrostatic barrier, neurotech arrays, invisible wall effect, BCI safety, behavioral threshold, triboelectric charging, corona discharge, cognitive entrainment, NIH NIMH NSF
