Cc: Department of Defense (DoD) / Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, internal communications, regulatory filings, or interagency agreements referencing the development, testing, or deployment of haptic-enabled mannequins, prosthetic surrogates, or simulation dolls with embedded hardware capable of transmitting or receiving signals linked to neural modulation or compliance studies, from January 1, 2005 to present.

This includes:
	•	Technical documentation on embedded haptics, telemetry, or sensory-feedback systems integrated into mannequin or doll platforms
	•	Records of federal contracts, vendor agreements, or grants involving companies producing lifelike prosthetics or simulation dolls for compliance or behavioral research
	•	Interagency communications regarding the use of surrogate hardware in behavioral modeling, neurotech-linked testing, or augmented reality simulation contexts
	•	Safety, risk assessment, or ethical reviews concerning neural synchronization between external hardware (mannequins, dolls) and implantable or wearable devices
	•	Reports or studies describing applications of embodied surrogates for behavioral entrainment, compliance anchoring, or sexualized realism in human subject trials
	•	Export controls, foreign partnership documentation, or technology transfer records related to lifelike haptic surrogates

Keywords: haptic surrogate, simulation doll, prosthetic mannequin, embodied compliance, neural synchronization, behavioral entrainment, sensory feedback, neurotech linkage, DARPA, CDRH
