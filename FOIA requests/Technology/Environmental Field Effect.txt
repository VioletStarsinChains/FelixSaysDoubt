Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, contracts, internal communications, reports, or contractor deliverables from 1990 to present referencing human health, cognitive performance, or behavioral changes in correlation with astronomical events such as:
	•	Planetary alignments, including Mercury retrograde periods
	•	Solar and lunar eclipses
	•	Equinoxes, solstices, and other major celestial events with high public attention or mass participation

This includes:
	•	Studies evaluating physiological responses (circulatory, neurological, vestibular, or musculoskeletal) during the above events, including but not limited to balance, fluid distribution, and reaction times
	•	Research into environmental field variations (gravitational gradient, electromagnetic fluctuation, atmospheric changes) intentionally induced or monitored during these events
	•	Behavioral modeling projects correlating astronomical events with changes in communication patterns, decision-making, error rates, or accident incidence
	•	Analysis of public engagement patterns (e.g., mass purchase of eclipse glasses, outdoor congregation) in relation to environmental monitoring or intervention opportunities
	•	Interagency or contractor collaborations assessing the potential for narrative-assisted environmental trials — where public expectations about astronomical events influence symptom reporting or perception

Keywords: Mercury retrograde, solar eclipse, lunar eclipse, planetary alignment, gravitational gradient, environmental field effect, cognitive performance, physiological response, behavioral modeling, narrative-assisted trial, DARPA, NASA, DoD
