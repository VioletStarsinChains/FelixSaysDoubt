To DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, internal communications, or contractor reports referencing technologies for the modulation, denial, or control of electronic device charging from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Research into remote or field-deployable systems that enable selective control over whether a device charges, how quickly it charges, or if it discharges
	•	Contractor or university research projects under DARPA relating to electromagnetic denial, directed energy, or power modulation technologies
	•	Applications of charging control in military, intelligence, or crowd control contexts
	•	Reports assessing behavioral or compliance outcomes linked to the controlled availability of device charging
	•	Interagency communications with DoD, NSA, IARPA, FCC, or DOE concerning selective power/charging modulation technologies

Keywords: charge denial, power modulation, charging control, directed energy, electromagnetic denial, device interdiction, compliance conditioning, DARPA
