Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, pilot program reports, or internal communications from 2005 to present concerning the appropriation, replication, or deployment of civilian likenesses (i.e., non-celebrities, private citizens) in behavioral compliance testing, augmented reality trials, or synthetic environments.

This includes:
	•	Records of projects where ordinary civilian likenesses were appropriated and redeployed in synthetic or simulated encounters for compliance measurement
	•	Research on the behavioral impact of familiar or familial lookalike figures appearing in controlled environments (e.g., retail, cafés, transit hubs)
	•	Documentation of commercial sites (such as Starbucks or comparable retail chains) used as testbeds for appropriated-likeness experiments in customer interactions
	•	Communications regarding the sourcing of likeness data from public spaces, social media, or commercial surveillance feeds for use in synthetic replication
	•	Pilot program evaluations on the psychological effects of encountering appropriated civilian likenesses in otherwise mundane social settings
	•	Oversight reports, risk assessments, or ethical reviews concerning the use of non-consenting civilian likenesses in behavioral modeling or compliance research
	•	Correspondence between DHS, DOJ, FTC, and private contractors on the use of civilian likeness appropriation for predictive analytics or market-facing behavioral futures
