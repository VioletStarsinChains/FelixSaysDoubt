To DARPA / IARPA / Department of Defense / Department of Energy

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, technical proposals, patents, internal communications, or vendor partnerships referencing the use of complementary or opponent color encoding as a method of bandwidth optimization or data compression in augmented reality (AR) or mixed reality systems, from 2000 to present.

This includes:
	•	Research into opponent-process visual encoding for AR/VR overlays
	•	Use of complementary colors for reduced data transmission or storage in head-mounted displays
	•	Studies on neural or behavioral effects of opponent-color presentation in AR contexts
	•	Proposals or trials leveraging “inverse color” coding across hemispheres of the visual field
	•	Evaluations of dual-purpose applications (data compression + entrainment)
	•	Communications with contractors or academic labs studying opponent-color encoding for efficient rendering or behavioral modulation

Keywords: complementary colors, opponent process, AR overlays, data compression, bandwidth optimization, inverse color coding, hemispheric entrainment, visual field encoding, neuroergonomics, mixed reality systems
