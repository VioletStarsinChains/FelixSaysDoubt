To National Security Agency (NSA) / Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA)

Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, program documents, procurement records, contractor reports, internal communications, ethics reviews, and technical assessments from 1985 to present concerning the use of synthetic voice modulation, signal interference, or auditory entrainment techniques to simulate “alien contact” or otherwise disguise surveillance-state operations as extraterrestrial phenomena.

This includes:
	•	Records of voiceprint manipulation or distortion technologies deployed in telephone networks or consumer devices to create “non-human” voices
	•	Studies of auditory hallucination induction through RF, microwave, or neuroacoustic methods intended to mimic alien encounters
	•	Documentation of psychological operations where UFO or alien themes were deliberately seeded to mask classified surveillance or communications research
	•	Reports on case studies involving U.S. service members or civilians (including unexplained telephone calls or synthetic voice events) where alien contact was offered as a cover story
	•	Risk assessments, ethics reviews, or oversight findings on the impact of using alien narratives to discredit or destabilize individuals subjected to synthetic voice experiments
	•	Contractor and vendor correspondence related to synthetic voice systems, vocoder modulation, or signal entrainment platforms designed for covert influence operations

Keywords: synthetic voice, voice modulation, voiceprint manipulation, signal interference, auditory entrainment, neuroacoustic hallucination, alien contact cover story, UFO narrative masking, Sudbrink phone calls, synthetic alien hallucination

⸻ 

To Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, program files, research proposals, internal communications, psychological operations manuals, contractor reports, or interagency correspondence from 1985 to present concerning the deliberate use of UFO or alien-contact narratives as cover for surveillance technologies, synthetic voice experiments, or behavioral entrainment programs.

This includes:
	•	Documents describing psychological operations where “alien encounters” or UFO sightings were seeded to obscure classified communications or surveillance projects
	•	Research into the use of synthetic voice modulation, signal interference, or neuroacoustic methods to induce “alien-like” voices or hallucinations in targeted individuals
	•	Case studies involving military personnel or civilians whose experiences of synthetic voices, anomalous calls, or induced hallucinations were framed as alien contact
	•	Interagency correspondence with NSA, DIA, or Air Force regarding narrative masking strategies tied to phone calls, broadcast interference, or neurotech deployment
	•	Contractor or vendor records involving perception management, disinformation campaigns, or media seeding designed to associate surveillance anomalies with extraterrestrials
	•	Ethics reviews, oversight reports, or Inspector General evaluations of programs using alien/UFO narratives to discredit or destabilize subjects

Keywords: psychological operations, perception management, synthetic voice, voice modulation, neuroacoustic hallucination, alien contact cover story, UFO narrative masking, Sudbrink phone calls, synthetic alien hallucination, surveillance disinformation

⸻ 

To Department of Defense (DOD) / United States Air Force

Request:

Requesting any and all records, program documentation, research proposals, after-action reports, internal communications, and contractor files from 1985 to present concerning the use of synthetic voice technologies, signal interference, or neuroacoustic methods to simulate “alien” voices, UFO contact, or other extraterrestrial phenomena as cover for surveillance or psychological operations targeting U.S. service members or civilians.

This includes:
	•	Records of telephone-based voice modulation or vocoder systems used to produce non-human or “robotic” speech effects in operational settings
	•	Technical reports on auditory entrainment or hallucination induction intended to mimic alien communication during training or field tests
	•	Programs where UFO/alien narratives were deliberately employed as a cover story to mask surveillance, communications research, or behavioral conditioning experiments
	•	Case files or incident reports involving Air Force personnel who experienced anomalous phone calls, synthetic voices, or “alien-contact” hallucinations (e.g., Sudbrink case or similar)
	•	Interagency correspondence with NSA, DIA, or CIA regarding the use of extraterrestrial cover stories for operational concealment
	•	Risk assessments, ethics reviews, or Inspector General evaluations on the use of alien/UFO framing to discredit or psychologically destabilize test subjects

Keywords: synthetic voice, voice modulation, neuroacoustic hallucination, auditory entrainment, alien contact cover story, UFO narrative masking, Sudbrink phone calls, Air Force surveillance experiments, perception management, behavioral conditioning

⸻ 

To National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)

Request:

Requesting any and all program records, internal communications, contractor reports, psychological research proposals, outreach materials, or interagency correspondence from 1985 to present concerning the use of UFO or alien-contact narratives as cover for surveillance research, synthetic voice technologies, or behavioral entrainment programs.

This includes:
	•	Records on synthetic voice modulation, vocoder systems, or auditory entrainment methods developed under NASA-funded communications research that could simulate “alien” voices
	•	Documentation of psychological or human-factors studies where space/alien themes were deliberately used as narrative framing for unrelated communications or surveillance experiments
	•	Case studies involving military or Air Force personnel (including incidents in San Antonio, TX or New York) where “alien” framing was associated with anomalous voice calls or hallucinations
	•	Interagency correspondence with DOD, NSA, DIA, or CIA regarding the use of extraterrestrial motifs to obscure technical programs in communications or neurocognitive research
	•	Outreach, media, or public-relations documents designed to seed or reinforce UFO/alien narratives connected to communications anomalies or voice technology demonstrations
	•	Oversight reviews or ethics evaluations concerning the use of alien narratives in U.S. public-facing or service-member-facing psychological operations

Keywords: NASA communications research, synthetic voice, neuroacoustic hallucination, alien cover story, UFO narrative masking, Sudbrink phone calls, San Antonio, Brooks Air Force Base, Johnson Space Center, behavioral entrainment
