To National Institute of Justice / Federal Bureau of Investigation / Department of Transportation

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, research proposals, internal communications, or vendor partnerships referencing the integration of smart dust, taggants, or micro-sensors into automotive paints, coatings, or metallic flake additives from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Research into embedding RFID, optical, or isotopic taggants within metallic flake or pearlescent paint layers
	•	Studies on the forensic tracking of automotive paint particles as surveillance markers beyond traditional color/flake analysis
	•	Testing of automotive coatings as potential camouflage or dispersal media for environmental or biometric sensors
	•	Communications with paint manufacturers, pigment suppliers, or automotive companies regarding dual-use applications of specialty coatings in national security or surveillance contexts
	•	Reports assessing the durability, detectability, or data-transmission capacity of sensor-enabled paint flakes under real-world automotive conditions
	•	Analysis of automotive paint as a vector for covert population monitoring, vehicle tracking, or forensic data capture

Keywords: automotive paint, metallic flake, pearlescent pigment, smart dust, taggant, forensic coating, RFID particle, optical marker, micro-sensor dispersal, vehicle tracking, forensic paint database

To: DARPA / Department of Defense / Department of Homeland Security

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, research proposals, vendor partnerships, or internal communications referencing the use of glitter-like particles, metallic flakes, or micro-particle coatings as carriers or camouflage for smart dust, taggants, or micro-sensors from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Research into embedding RFID, optical taggants, or chemical markers in consumer glitter products or craft supplies
	•	Studies on the dispersal of sensor-enabled or trackable particles via mail-order “glitter bomb” services
	•	Investigations into the forensic or surveillance applications of automotive paint flakes containing metallic or synthetic pearlescent components
	•	Testing of glitter-like materials as dispersal vectors for environmental, biometric, or behavioral monitoring sensors
	•	Communications with contractors producing pigments, coatings, or glitter-like materials regarding dual-use applications in national security or surveillance
	•	Reports on the use of reflective flakes, taggants, or “chaff”-like materials for civilian population monitoring or crowd control

Keywords: glitter, smart dust, taggant, metallic flake, pearlescent pigment, automotive paint, forensic coating, RFID particle, optical marker, micro-sensor dispersal, chaff, camouflage medium

To Consumer Product Safety Commission / Department of Commerce / Department of Homeland Security

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, research proposals, vendor partnerships, or internal communications referencing the integration of taggants, smart dust, or micro-sensors into consumer glitter, craft supplies, or decorative products from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Research into embedding RFID, optical taggants, or isotopic markers into craft glitter sold through major retailers (e.g., Michaels, Hobby Lobby, Walmart)
	•	Studies on the potential for consumer glitter products to serve as dispersal vectors for environmental, biometric, or behavioral monitoring sensors
	•	Testing of glitter’s persistence on skin, textiles, and household surfaces in relation to surveillance or forensic tracking applications
	•	Communications with glitter or pigment manufacturers regarding dual-use applications in population monitoring or national security contexts
	•	Analysis of the safety, detectability, or communication capacity of glitter particles containing nano- or micro-scale electronic or optical components
	•	Reports on consumer-facing glitter products as cover for covert taggant distribution, including forensic, security, or law enforcement uses

Keywords: glitter, craft supplies, smart dust, taggant, metallic flake, optical marker, RFID particle, forensic tracking, consumer product, pigment, micro-sensor dispersal
