Request:

Requesting any and all contracts, regulatory filings, enforcement actions, or communications from January 1, 2005 to present concerning the installation or deployment of aftermarket telematics, GPS modules, or connected-vehicle hardware in consumer automobiles during insurance-sponsored repair or auto body shop service.

This includes:
	•	Vendor contracts or partnerships between auto body shops, insurers, and technology providers
	•	Regulatory audits of privacy compliance and consumer consent in installation of telematics systems
	•	Reports or complaints regarding tracking devices, black box systems, or connected sensors embedded during repairs
	•	Interagency communications on the use of repair sites as data collection points

Keywords: aftermarket telematics, auto repair tracking, black box devices, GPS modules, connected vehicles, insurance data sharing, NHTSA, FTC compliance, body shop installation, repair telemetry

Request:

Requesting any and all interagency reports, communications, research proposals, or contractor agreements from January 1, 2005 to present concerning the use of auto body shops as deployment sites for covert telemetry devices in consumer vehicles, in connection with:
	•	Accident inducement modeling and subsequent repair workflows
	•	Integration of installed devices into driver risk scoring, predictive policing, or behavioral futures markets
	•	Testing or deployment of cognitive entrainment infrastructure via in-vehicle hardware or roadway-to-vehicle signaling
	•	Interagency or contractor discussions regarding insurance networks as cover for covert surveillance insertion

Keywords: auto body shop telemetry, covert tracking, behavioral futures, predictive policing, crash inducement, risk scoring, connected vehicle surveillance, DHS pilot programs, insurance compliance, repair shop vendors

Request:

Requesting any and all interagency communications, contractor reports, research proposals, or regulatory filings from January 1, 2005 to present concerning the use of synthetic accident induction and augmented reality body damage simulations as cover mechanisms for deployment of telemetry, tracking, or behavioral monitoring devices in consumer automobiles.

This includes:
	•	Pilot programs or contractor proposals on accident induction via roadway design, infrasound, strobe effects, or augmented reality overlays
	•	Records concerning AR-generated or simulated body damage used to justify insurance claims or repairs
	•	Internal studies on the integration of spyware, black boxes, or covert tracking modules during insurance-sponsored repair workflows
	•	Interagency discussions regarding consumer payment of deductibles or repair costs as a façade of “consent” for covert technology deployment
	•	Reports analyzing downstream use of data for risk scoring, predictive policing, or behavioral futures markets

Keywords: synthetic accidents, augmented reality body damage, insurance repair telemetry, covert tracking, accident induction modeling, behavioral futures, predictive policing, crash simulation, black box devices, DHS pilot programs
