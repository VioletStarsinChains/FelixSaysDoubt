To Maryland Department of Health / Maryland Department of Human Services / Maryland Office of Procurement

Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, grant documentation, inspection reports, or internal communications from 2000 to present concerning the purchase, distribution, or evaluation of hypodermic syringes, needles, or harm reduction supplies funded or distributed under state programs (e.g., syringe services programs, safe syringe disposal initiatives, public health outreach, community harm reduction).

This includes:
	•	Records of vendor specifications or contracts describing the use of nanomaterials (including nitrogen vacancy [NV] nanodiamonds, quantum dots, carbon nanotubes, or other nanoparticles) in syringe manufacturing, coatings, lubricants, or needle surfaces.
	•	Internal studies, adverse event reports, or communications regarding the safety, biocompatibility, or surveillance potential of syringes containing nanomaterials distributed in Maryland.
	•	Oversight documents, grant reviews, or state–federal communications on the integration of nanoscale technologies into syringe distribution or harm reduction programs.
	•	Reports or evaluations concerning the collection and analysis of returned/disposed syringes under state-funded programs, including testing for residual nanomaterials or unexplained particulates.
	•	Correspondence with federal partners (CDC, NIDA, FDA) or syringe manufacturers regarding the use of nanotechnology in harm reduction infrastructure.
