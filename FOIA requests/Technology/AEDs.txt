FOIA – Safety & EMF Effects of AEDs

To: Food and Drug Administration (FDA) / Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, reports, contracts, or interagency communications from 2000 to present concerning safety testing, electromagnetic emissions, or adverse event reports involving Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs).

This includes:
	•	Records of neurological, sensory, or off-target physiological effects of AED shocks beyond cardiac resuscitation
	•	Reports on electromagnetic interference generated by AEDs and their impact on bystanders, implants, or medical devices
	•	Contracts with private vendors, universities, or testing labs to study secondary effects of AEDs on human cognition, autonomic function, or stress responses
	•	Internal analyses regarding potential environmental or occupational hazards related to AED deployment in public spaces

Keywords: AED, automated external defibrillator, cardiac defibrillator, EMF emissions, neurological side effects, FDA, CDRH, adverse event report, public access defibrillator

FOIA (Spicy Angle – AEDs as Entrainment & Behavioral Futures Platforms)

To: Department of Defense (DoD) / Department of Homeland Security (DHS) / Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)

Request:
Requesting any and all documents, contracts, communications, or internal analyses from 2000 to present concerning the use of Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) or similar cardiac stimulation devices as platforms for entrainment, compliance testing, or behavioral futures research.

This includes:
	•	Records describing AED shock pulses or electromagnetic emissions as tools for nervous system entrainment, stress conditioning, or compliance induction
	•	Contracts with defense contractors, universities, or private vendors investigating AEDs as dual-use devices for behavioral modeling or stress-response testing
	•	Reports on AED deployment in public spaces as opportunities for population-level monitoring, biometric harvesting, or entrainment exposure
	•	Internal analyses linking cardiac resuscitation technology to broader behavioral futures frameworks involving crisis-induced compliance or civilian stress testing

Keywords: AED, automated external defibrillator, cardiac entrainment, compliance testing, behavioral futures, DARPA, DHS, DoD, stress conditioning, dual-use device
