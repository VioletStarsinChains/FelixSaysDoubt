FOIA 1 — Field-Responsive Soil Seeding + Geohazard Induction

To Department of Defense (DoD) / DARPA / Department of Homeland Security (DHS) / Department of Energy (DOE) / U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) / Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) / National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)

Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, contracts, internal communications, incident analyses, test reports, or contractor deliverables from 1990 to present referencing the introduction or presence of engineered or naturally responsive particulates in soils in relation to induced or controlled changes in load-bearing capacity, settlement, sinkhole formation, liquefaction, or structural failure under variable gravity, acceleration, electromagnetic, or acoustic field conditions.

This includes:
	•	Bench, field, or tabletop experiments on soils seeded with ferromagnetic, paramagnetic, conductive, or piezoelectric particles (e.g., magnetite/iron oxides, barium titanate, PZT ceramics, carbon nanotubes/graphene oxide, metallic oxides, engineered nanomaterials) to alter mechanical response under field exposure
	•	Studies on gravity-gradient or artificial gravity testbeds evaluating geotechnical stability of particle‑modified soils (including centrifuge or parabolic flight geotechnics)
	•	Modeling/measurement of acoustic, electromagnetic, or inertial field coupling into particle‑modified soils leading to localized bearing capacity loss, resonance, or failure
	•	Interagency or contractor correspondence on environmental safety, risk assessment, or crowd/asset protection related to field-responsive soil matrices
	•	Post‑event analyses correlating unexplained ground failures with field trials, variable‑g environments, or particle‑enriched substrates

Keywords: field‑responsive soils, engineered particulates, ferromagnetic soil, piezoelectric soil, variable gravity, gravitational gradient, liquefaction, resonance‑induced failure, geotechnical risk, DARPA, USGS, EPA, NASA

FOIA 2 — Waste Stream Vectors for Soil Seeding (Compost, Biosolids, Landfill Leachate)

To Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) / U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) / Department of Energy (DOE) / Department of Defense (DoD) / National Institutes of Health (NIH) / Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, internal communications, laboratory reports, or surveillance data from 2000 to present regarding the introduction of conductive, magnetic, piezoelectric, or other responsive particles into soils via municipal biosolids, compostable consumer products, industrial byproducts, or landfill leachate, and subsequent evaluation of environmental or public safety impacts.

This includes:
	•	Testing of compostable packaging/cup linings, wooden stir sticks, paper products, or coatings for release of metallic nanoparticles, graphene derivatives, or ceramic particulates into compost and soils
	•	Monitoring of biosolids/sludge land application for engineered nanoparticles (iron oxides, barium titanate, CNT/graphene, aluminum or titanium oxides) and assessments of their geotechnical or electromagnetic responsiveness
	•	Interagency/contractor studies on whether waste stream–borne particulates change soil mechanical properties or couple to external fields (EM/acoustic/inertial)
	•	Risk assessments or incident reviews linking particle‑seeded soils to localized subsidence, sinkholes, or liquefaction-like behavior under normal or anomalous environmental conditions
	•	Communications with state agencies or private contractors regarding standards, detection methods, or mitigation of engineered particle load in agricultural and urban soils

FOIA 3 — Human Factors + Crowd Load in Field‑Modulated Environments (Tie‑in to EDS/POTS)

To Department of Defense (DoD) / DARPA / U.S. Navy (NAVSEA/ONR) / U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) / NASA

Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, protocols, contracts, internal communications, or reports from 1990 to present addressing human crowd load effects and ground/structure safety in simulated or induced variable‑gravity or acceleration environments, especially where soil or flooring substrates were engineered or particle‑modified, and where sensitive cohorts (e.g., Ehlers–Danlos Syndrome (EDS), Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), dysautonomia) were monitored for physiological markers.

This includes:
	•	Studies modeling aggregate effective weight or phase‑synchronized loading of groups under gravitational gradient or inertial field conditions
	•	Trials assessing substrate resonance or failure thresholds when human subjects are present over particle‑modified soil or layered flooring
	•	Use of sensitive physiological cohorts (EDS, POTS) as early detectors of small g‑load changes, with correlated geotechnical measurements (settlement, shear strength, pore pressure)
	•	Contractor deliverables on environmental field safety for facilities, decks, or pavements exposed to adjustable g/acceleration profiles

Keywords: crowd loading, variable gravity, acceleration environment, gravitational gradient, engineered substrate, resonance, EDS, POTS, AFRL, ONR, NASA
