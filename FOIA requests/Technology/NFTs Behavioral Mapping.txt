Request:
Requesting any and all documents, funding records, contracts, research proposals, internal communications, or vendor partnerships related to the use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in behavioral modeling and predictive analytics from 2015 to present.

This includes but is not limited to:
	•	Pilot studies or funded research involving NFTs as identity anchors for behavioral datasets, particularly when tied to biometric or psychometric measures
	•	Experimental use of NFTs in predictive modeling of vulnerable populations (mentally ill, unhoused, or disabled cohorts)
	•	Communications on NFT-linked compliance testing or the use of NFTs to measure response to entrainment stimuli (neurotech, AR overlays, synthetic hallucinations, environmental manipulation)
	•	Records of NFT integration with federally sponsored neuroeconomics projects or market simulation platforms
	•	Data-sharing agreements involving NFTs as proxies for human-subject identifiers in behavioral futures markets
	•	Internal discussions or ethical reviews concerning nonconsensual behavioral tracking tied to digital assets or crypto wallets
	•	Cross-agency correspondence regarding oversight of NFT marketplaces as behavioral laboratories or environments for covert experimentation
	•	Reports on adverse events or complaints related to NFT-driven biometric data harvesting or manipulation of housing/employment access
