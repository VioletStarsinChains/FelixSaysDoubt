To NIH / NIMH / DARPA / NSF / FTC / SEC / HUD / DHS / HHS Office for Human Research Protections

Request:
Requesting any and all documents, funding records, contracts, research proposals, internal communications, or vendor partnerships related to the use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in behavioral modeling and predictive analytics from 2015 to present.

This includes but is not limited to:
	•	Pilot studies or funded research involving NFTs as identity anchors for behavioral datasets, particularly when tied to biometric or psychometric measures
	•	Experimental use of NFTs in predictive modeling of vulnerable populations (mentally ill, unhoused, or disabled cohorts)
	•	Communications on NFT-linked compliance testing or the use of NFTs to measure response to entrainment stimuli (neurotech, AR overlays, synthetic hallucinations, environmental manipulation)
	•	Records of NFT integration with federally sponsored neuroeconomics projects or market simulation platforms
	•	Data-sharing agreements involving NFTs as proxies for human-subject identifiers in behavioral futures markets
	•	Internal discussions or ethical reviews concerning nonconsensual behavioral tracking tied to digital assets or crypto wallets
	•	Cross-agency correspondence regarding oversight of NFT marketplaces as behavioral laboratories or environments for covert experimentation
	•	Reports on adverse events or complaints related to NFT-driven biometric data harvesting or manipulation of housing/employment access

Keywords:
NFT biometric anchor, behavioral futures markets, predictive modeling, neuroeconomics, signal entrainment, synthetic compliance testing, unhoused populations, digital identity tether, neurotech data harvesting, MCAS simulation, nonconsensual experimentation, SEC crypto oversight


//////////


To Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)

Request:
Requesting any and all documents, reports, communications, research proposals, enforcement files, or internal memoranda from 2015 to present regarding the use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as instruments of behavioral modeling or predictive market simulation.

This includes:
	•	Records of NFTs being investigated or monitored as identity anchors in trading behavior datasets
	•	Research or vendor proposals using NFTs as behavioral compliance markers in financial ecosystems
	•	Internal discussions about NFT-linked biometric data harvesting and its potential role in market forecasting or fraud detection
	•	Enforcement or compliance files referencing NFTs used as proxies for human-subject experimentation in behavioral futures markets
	•	Cross-agency communications with NIH, DARPA, FTC, HUD, or DHS regarding NFTs in behavioral prediction, neuroeconomics, or consumer surveillance
	•	Ethical or legal reviews of NFT marketplaces as covert behavioral laboratories
	•	Any reference to NFTs being used to simulate MCAS or inflammatory response cohorts for predictive modeling of consumer/market reactions

Keywords:
NFT financial surveillance, behavioral futures, predictive trading simulation, biometric anchor, compliance token, neuroeconomics, crypto oversight, digital identity tether, SEC enforcement, signal entrainment

To Federal Trade Commission (FTC)

Request:
Requesting any and all documents, investigations, consumer complaints, research partnerships, or internal communications from 2015 to present concerning the use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in consumer behavior tracking, predictive analytics, or experimental behavioral modeling.

This includes:
	•	Consumer complaints alleging nonconsensual data harvesting through NFTs or NFT marketplaces
	•	Records of investigations into NFT-based behavioral targeting or coercive compliance testing
	•	Communications with tech vendors, marketing firms, or research groups about NFTs as tools for entrainment, synthetic influence, or digital coercion
	•	Internal analyses of NFTs as identity anchors for consumer datasets or as instruments of surveillance capitalism
	•	Studies or reports on the overlap between NFTs, neuroeconomics research, and predictive modeling of vulnerable populations (unhoused, disabled, mentally ill)
	•	FTC guidance or deliberations on whether NFTs constitute consumer protection risks due to covert biometric/psychometric data tethering

Keywords:
NFT consumer protection, behavioral tracking, digital coercion, surveillance capitalism, predictive analytics, compliance testing, biometric anchor, neuroeconomics, synthetic influence, nonconsensual data harvesting
