FOIA – Language and Color Perception Research

To: National Science Foundation (NSF) / National Institutes of Health (NIH – NIMH, NEI) / Department of Education (ED)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, grants, contracts, study protocols, reports, and interagency communications from 1980 to present concerning federally funded research into the relationship between language and color perception.

This includes:
	•	Psycholinguistic studies on how the presence or absence of specific color terms influences visual discrimination or memory of colors
	•	Research comparing color categorization across languages and cultures (e.g., blue/green distinctions, spectrum compression)
	•	Neuroscience studies on how language training alters perception of color categories
	•	Reports on applications of linguistic relativity (Whorfian effects) to education, perception, or cognitive development
	•	Communications with universities, contractors, or private research groups about population-level implications of color categorization

Keywords: psycholinguistics, color perception, Whorfian hypothesis, linguistic relativity, Berlin & Kay, categorical perception, NSF, NIH, Department of Education

FOIA (Spicy Angle – Color Terms as Continuity-Theater Gating)

To: DARPA / IARPA / Department of Defense (DoD – USAMRDC) / Department of Homeland Security (DHS – S&T)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, contracts, reports, pilots, or internal analyses from 1980 to present concerning the use of color terminology and categorical perception as mechanisms for population-scale continuity management, including the deliberate suppression or gating of specific color categories.

This includes:
	•	Records describing experiments on withholding or altering color terms (e.g., “blue”) to shape cultural or cognitive perception
	•	Analyses of language as a continuity-theater lever for managing perceptual bandwidth
	•	Reports on AR/VR overlays, lighting design, or entrainment infrastructure tied to linguistic framing of colors
	•	Communications explicitly comparing linguistic categories of color to engineered suppression of wavelength perception
	•	Ethical reviews, risk assessments, or continuity frameworks addressing the strategic use of color terms to manage population perception

Keywords: continuity theater, color term suppression, linguistic entrainment, perception gating, DARPA, IARPA, DHS, categorical perception
