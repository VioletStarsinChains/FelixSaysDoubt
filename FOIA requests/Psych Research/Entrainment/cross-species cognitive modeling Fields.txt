To Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) / Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, research proposals, interagency communications, laboratory reports, or oversight reviews from 1990 to present concerning the use of cross-species cognitive modeling in conjunction with environmental entrainment fields for surveillance, behavioral prediction, or population-level modulation.

This includes:
	•	Research on the use of animal cognition models (e.g., prey/predator responses, flocking/schooling, vigilance, aggression, startle reflex) as analogues for human behavior.
	•	Studies or projects that combine symbolic animal cues (such as images, statues, or archetypes) with engineered environmental fields (acoustic, electromagnetic, or bioaerosol) to entrain cross-species patterns into human subjects.
	•	Contractor reports or simulations describing hybrid AI models that integrate animal cognition baselines into predictive human-behavior datasets.
	•	Communications between DARPA/IARPA and contractors (e.g., RAND, MITRE, Booz Allen Hamilton, Battelle, Palantir Technologies) regarding cross-species cognitive modeling in applied surveillance systems.
	•	Oversight or ethics reviews addressing the dual-use or behavioral risks of exposing populations to cross-species entrainment fields.

To National Institutes of Health (NIH) / Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, grant applications, research proposals, laboratory studies, interagency communications, or oversight reviews from 1990 to present concerning the use of animal cognition models as analogues for human behavioral or immune responses, particularly when combined with environmental exposure fields (acoustic, electromagnetic, or aerosol).

This includes:
	•	NIH- or CDC-funded studies using animal vigilance, startle reflexes, predator-prey behaviors, or flocking/schooling responses as templates for human stress, immune modulation, or behavioral research.
	•	Research exploring cross-species entrainment of stress responses by exposing humans to symbolic animal cues (images, statues, archetypes) in combination with environmental fields.
	•	Laboratory studies or epidemiological surveys describing immune dysregulation, histamine release, or mast cell activation when humans are exposed to field conditions designed using animal cognition baselines.
	•	Oversight reviews or ethics discussions about the dual-use implications of cross-species analogues in public health surveillance or behavioral tracking.
	•	Communications between NIH, CDC, or affiliated contractors regarding cross-species cognitive modeling for stress, immunity, or public health monitoring.
