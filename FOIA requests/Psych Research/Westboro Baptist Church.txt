To Department of Homeland Security (DHS) / DHS Science & Technology Directorate (S&T) / DHS Office of Intelligence & Analysis (I&A)

Request:

Requesting any and all reports, research proposals, pilot projects, contracts, or interagency communications from January 1, 2005 to present concerning the use of augmented reality (AR), mixed reality, or perceptual overlay technologies in the context of protest signage, placards, banners, or other visual messaging in public demonstrations.

This includes:
	•	Threat assessments or research on AR overlays altering the appearance of protest signage to observers, law enforcement, or media while differing from what demonstrators believe they are displaying
	•	DHS S&T pilot programs evaluating the behavioral or crowd-control effects of mismatched perception of protest messaging through AR
	•	Interagency communications with law enforcement, contractors, or technology vendors regarding AR overlays for managing or manipulating protest signage visibility
	•	Reports or analyses concerning civil liberties, First Amendment implications, or public trust risks associated with perceptual overlay of protest materials
	•	Documentation of consumer complaints, legal reviews, or incident reports where AR systems were alleged to have altered the appearance of protest signs in public gatherings

Keywords: DHS S&T, AR overlays, protest signage, perceptual overlay, public demonstrations, crowd control, behavioral modeling, visual deception, free speech, First Amendment

To Department of Defense (DoD) / Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) / Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) / Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA)

Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, contracts, program documentation, or interagency communications from January 1, 2005 to present concerning the behavioral or cognitive modeling of protest dynamics where augmented reality (AR), mixed reality, or perceptual overlay systems alter the perceived content of protest signage or banners.

This includes:
	•	Human factors studies on crowd perception, compliance, or escalation when signage appears differently to demonstrators versus observers
	•	Research into operational deception or counter-messaging strategies using AR overlays on protest materials
	•	Program descriptions evaluating predictive modeling of population response to AR-manipulated protest messaging
	•	Communications with universities, defense contractors, or law enforcement agencies regarding field tests of perceptual overlays in public demonstrations
	•	Documentation of ethical reviews, civil liberties assessments, or legal analyses of AR signage manipulation in the context of constitutionally protected speech

Keywords: DARPA behavioral modeling, IARPA protest research, AR overlays, protest signage manipulation, mixed reality crowd dynamics, perception management, operational deception, cognitive modeling, First Amendment impacts, visual overlays

To Federal Trade Commission (FTC)

Request:

Requesting any and all reports, complaints, enforcement actions, contracts, or interagency communications from January 1, 2005 to present concerning the use of augmented reality (AR), mixed reality, or perceptual overlay technologies to alter the perceived content of signage, placards, banners, or advertising in public spaces.

This includes:
	•	Analyses of consumer deception or misrepresentation where AR overlays caused signage or printed materials to appear differently to different observers
	•	Complaints or incident reports regarding misleading or manipulated text, logos, or messages in retail, advertising, or public demonstrations through AR systems
	•	Communications with corporations, technology vendors, or contractors about AR applications for altering signage content or public-facing displays
	•	Reports on civil liberties, consumer disclosure, or First Amendment concerns raised by the perceptual manipulation of signage in public spaces
	•	Interagency discussions regarding enforcement, regulation, or consumer protection in cases of AR-based signage overlays

Keywords: augmented reality, perceptual overlay, AR signage manipulation, misleading signage, consumer deception, mixed reality advertising, public demonstrations, false representation, FTC enforcement, visual overlays
