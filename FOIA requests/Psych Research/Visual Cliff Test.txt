To Department of Defense (DoD) / Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) / Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) / National Institutes of Health (NIH)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, contracts, or interagency communications from January 1, 1960 to present referencing the use of the Visual Cliff Experiment or the Marshmallow Test in the context of compliance modeling, behavioral prediction, or risk assessment.

This includes:
	•	Internal studies or literature reviews on the visual cliff as a probe for authority-overriding instinct, or as a predictive measure of risk tolerance and obedience.
	•	Analyses of the marshmallow test as a predictor of long-term compliance, trust calibration, or consumer/economic behavior.
	•	Research proposals linking either experiment to behavioral economics, military training, or neurotechnology applications.
	•	Vendor or contractor reports discussing experimental adaptation of these paradigms for surveillance, entrainment, or predictive analytics.
	•	Interagency communications (including DoD, DARPA, HHS, NIH, and affiliated contractors) on the predictive or commercial utility of these tests.
	•	Any pilot projects using modified versions of these paradigms in virtual reality, augmented reality, educational programs, or compliance training simulations.

Keywords: visual cliff, marshmallow test, compliance modeling, delayed gratification, risk tolerance, obedience prediction, behavioral economics, DARPA, neurotechnology entrainment, trust calibration

Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, or communications from January 1, 1960 to present referencing the Visual Cliff Experiment or the Marshmallow Test as compliance testing apparatus for predictive modeling, behavioral futures markets, or entrainment systems.

This includes:
	•	Analyses of the visual cliff as a measure of willingness to override instinctive sensory cues when prompted by authority, and its potential application to compliance or obedience training.
	•	Reports or studies using the marshmallow test as a sorting mechanism for populations based on trust in institutional promises, delayed gratification, or consumer compliance horizons.
	•	Contractor or vendor proposals for adapting these childhood experiments into large-scale data pipelines for predictive analytics, surveillance, or targeted marketing.
	•	Interagency or corporate communications connecting these paradigms to behavioral economics, predictive policing, military selection, or long-term compliance profiling.
	•	Records referencing the use of either paradigm in virtual/augmented reality, neurotechnology-based entrainment, or simulations designed to test thresholds of compliance vs. resistance.
	•	Any documentation of these paradigms being incorporated into pricing models or futures markets built on human behavioral prediction.

Keywords: compliance apparatus, behavioral futures, predictive modeling, visual cliff, marshmallow test, obedience entrainment, neurotech manipulation, risk modeling, consumer compliance, DARPA contractors

Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, or communications from January 1, 2003 to present concerning Palantir Technologies and its ingestion, analysis, or reinterpretation of legacy behavioral research — specifically including the Visual Cliff Experiment and the Marshmallow Test — for purposes of compliance modeling, predictive analytics, or behavioral futures markets.

This includes:
	•	Documentation of Palantir’s access to or integration of NIH, DARPA, or other federal datasets derived from the visual cliff or marshmallow test paradigms.
	•	Reports, presentations, or internal analyses describing how these paradigms were re-indexed or adapted into modern compliance frameworks (e.g., risk tolerance scoring, obedience prediction, or consumer time-horizon modeling).
	•	Records of Palantir collaborations with hedge funds, insurers, or federal contractors where marshmallow test–style delayed gratification data or visual cliff–style authority override measures were applied to financial or operational forecasting.
	•	Communications discussing the predictive or commercial utility of these paradigms once ingested into Palantir platforms (e.g., Gotham, Foundry).
	•	Interagency or inter-contractor correspondence on behavioral profiling derived from legacy psychological experiments and implemented via Palantir’s data systems.

Keywords: Palantir, Gotham, Foundry, behavioral futures, compliance modeling, legacy datasets, visual cliff, marshmallow test, risk tolerance, obedience prediction, consumer compliance, predictive analytics
