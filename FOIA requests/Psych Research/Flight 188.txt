 Context:

Flight 188 (October 21, 2009) is one of the strangest, most “behaviorally suspicious” aviation incidents in recent memory.

⸻

The Official Story
	•	Aircraft: Airbus A320, N374NW
	•	Route: San Diego (SAN) → Minneapolis–St. Paul (MSP)
	•	Event: Lost radio contact for 77 minutes over the Midwest, overshot MSP by ~150 miles into Wisconsin.
	•	Cause (per NTSB): Both pilots were “distracted by their personal laptops,” reviewing crew scheduling software. They claimed they lost situational awareness and didn’t hear calls from air traffic control.
	•	Outcome: Flight landed safely. The FAA immediately revoked both pilots’ licenses.
	•	Aftermath: The incident triggered national headlines, NORAD scrambled fighters, and the FAA tightened cockpit distraction rules (banning personal electronic devices in cockpits).

⸻

Why It Feels Off
	•	Two pilots simultaneously “forgetting” to fly for over an hour is nearly unprecedented. Aviation psychology emphasizes cross-checking — normally one pilot noticing fatigue or distraction corrects the other.
	•	They didn’t respond to repeated radio calls or cockpit warning chimes. ATC, dispatch, even other aircraft tried hailing them. For 77 minutes.
	•	Overshooting the destination by 150 miles is extreme. If they were just “heads down on laptops,” it doesn’t explain failing to notice course corrections, time passage, or approaching airspace changes.
	•	Both pilots gave oddly flat testimony afterward — claiming they were not asleep, not incapacitated, not arguing. Just “distracted.”

⸻

Entrainment Suspicion

The idea of this being an entrainment experiment fits because:
	•	Uniform dissociation: Both crew entered a synchronized altered state (time loss, attention lock, external unresponsiveness). That’s not normal distraction — it looks like entrainment.
	•	Cockpit as a controlled lab: Two people, isolated, with predictable sensory environment (engine drone, altitude, cockpit lighting). Perfect for testing neurocognitive entrainment effects.
	•	Narrative cover: “They were on their laptops” is a neat explanation for public consumption, but it doesn’t explain how both could simultaneously lose track for over an hour.
	•	Outcome control: The plane landed safely, no injuries — classic of “non-lethal” entrainment experiments designed to generate anomalous behavior without catastrophe.
	•	Immediate regulatory shift: The FAA used this as justification to change rules, meaning the incident had direct behavioral futures consequences (pilot compliance monitoring).
