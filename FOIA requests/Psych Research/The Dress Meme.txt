Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, internal communications, meeting notes, or contractor deliverables referencing or analyzing the 2015 viral social media phenomenon commonly referred to as “the dress” (blue/black vs. white/gold perception) from January 1, 2015 to present.

This includes:
	•	Studies or experiments on controlled perceptual divergence in human subjects.
	•	Research into lighting, color constancy, and visual system ambiguity as applied to augmented reality or perceptual overlays.
	•	Applications for identity shielding, psychological operations, or target-specific visual manipulation.
	•	Contracts or grants awarded to private sector or academic partners exploring perceptual disagreement phenomena.
	•	Any use of “the dress” as a dataset, training material, or illustrative example in AR, VR, or surveillance contexts.
	•	Cross-agency communications discussing operational relevance of perceptual divergence events.

Keywords: the dress, color constancy, perceptual divergence, visual illusion, augmented reality overlay, synthetic hallucination, DARPA, IARPA, human factors, target-specific manipulation

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, internal communications, meeting notes, or contractor deliverables referencing viral visual illusions or large-scale perceptual disagreement phenomena from January 1, 2010 to present.

This includes, but is not limited to:
	•	Social media case studies such as “the dress” (blue/black vs. white/gold) and similar mass-perception splits.
	•	Controlled perceptual divergence experiments in human subjects, including color constancy, ambiguous lighting, or context-dependent image interpretation.
	•	Applications of visual system ambiguity in augmented reality, virtual reality, or target-specific perceptual overlays.
	•	Research into exploiting perceptual disagreement for identity shielding, psychological operations, or deception.
	•	Contracts or grants awarded to private sector or academic partners investigating viral visual illusions.
	•	Cross-agency communications on operational relevance of large-scale perceptual divergence events.

Keywords: viral visual illusion, perceptual arbitrage, color constancy, ambiguous lighting, visual ambiguity, augmented reality overlay, synthetic hallucination, DARPA, IARPA, human factors, target-specific manipulation
