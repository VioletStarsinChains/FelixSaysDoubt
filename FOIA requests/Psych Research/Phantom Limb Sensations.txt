Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, internal communications, or funded studies on neurotechnology-based induction or modulation of phantom limb sensations from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Studies using cortical or peripheral nerve stimulation to elicit or suppress phantom limb sensations
	•	Research combining neuroprosthetics, VR, or mirror therapy with phantom body part perception
	•	Investigations into body schema modification or remapping of somatosensory/motor cortices
	•	Trials involving targeted muscle reinnervation or nerve rerouting to alter phantom sensations
	•	Internal communications or grant materials on psychosocial applications of phantom limb induction
	•	Reports on the use of phantom sensation induction for pain management, sexual function, or dysphoria relief

Keywords: phantom limb, body schema, somatosensory remapping, neuroprosthetics, targeted muscle reinnervation, cortical stimulation, VR therapy, body ownership illusion, dysphoria modulation, sensory substitution

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, internal communications, or funded studies on neurotechnology-based induction or modulation of phantom limb and phantom organ sensations from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Experiments evoking phantom genitalia through cortical or peripheral stimulation
	•	Studies of somatosensory remapping linked to gender identity or dysphoria
	•	VR or mirror-therapy protocols used to induce phantom sexual organs or alter perceived body configuration
	•	Reports on the use of phantom sensation induction for gender affirmation, dysphoria mitigation, or experimental modulation of sexual function
	•	Communications regarding dual-use applications of phantom organ induction in behavioral or psychological modeling
