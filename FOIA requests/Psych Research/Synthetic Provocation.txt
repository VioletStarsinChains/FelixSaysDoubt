FOIA: Synthetic Provocation & School Shootings

To: Department of Justice / Federal Bureau of Investigation / Department of Homeland Security / Department of Defense / DARPA

Request:
Requesting any and all research proposals, contracts, internal communications, or interagency agreements from 1990 to present regarding the simulation, fabrication, or deliberate staging of violent incidents (including but not limited to school shootings, workplace shootings, or public mass violence events) for the purpose of behavioral study, risk population testing, or predictive modeling.

This includes:
	•	Materials or datasets describing synthetic or simulated school shooting events used in modeling copycat behavior or contagion effects.
	•	Communications on the development or use of provocative content intended to influence or escalate behavioral responses in flagged populations.
	•	Oversight reports or reviews of programs where staged or synthetic incidents were deployed as part of extremism prevention, risk assessment, or counterterrorism modeling.
	•	Studies examining the role of fabricated violent events in shaping public opinion, compliance, or support for increased surveillance and securitization measures.
	•	Documentation of predictive modeling projects that explicitly distinguish between real-world and synthetically staged events in outcome datasets.

Keywords: synthetic provocation, staged violent incident, simulated school shooting, behavioral contagion modeling, predictive violence testing, event fabrication, extremism provocation, synthetic dataset violence

FOIA: Synthetic Provocation & Activist Suicides (Aaron Bushnell Case)

To: Department of Defense / Department of Homeland Security / Department of Justice / Central Intelligence Agency

Request:
Requesting any and all records, contracts, communications, or internal reports from 1990 to present concerning the fabrication, staging, or synthetic reproduction of activist self-harm events (including suicides or self-immolation) for the purposes of behavioral modeling, psychological operations, or influence campaigns.

This includes:
	•	Proposals or pilot programs involving synthetic or staged activist suicides used as provocations to influence activist movements.
	•	Interagency communications on the behavioral impact of high-profile suicide events as catalysts for increased political radicalization or unrest.
	•	Analyses or datasets assessing the copycat risk of activist suicides, particularly where materials may have been fabricated or staged to influence behavior.
	•	Research into the use of synthetic kompromat or fabricated media depicting activist suicides as part of psychological operations or predictive modeling.
	•	Oversight documents or internal reviews distinguishing authentic incidents from synthetic provocation materials in behavioral outcome datasets.

Keywords: synthetic provocation, activist suicide modeling, staged self-immolation, behavioral futures, psychological operations, copycat suicide study, synthetic media suicide

FOIA: Synthetic Provocation Events within CVE Programs

To: Department of Homeland Security / Federal Bureau of Investigation / Department of Justice / Department of Defense / Office of the Director of National Intelligence

Request:
Requesting any and all records, contracts, communications, or interagency agreements from 2008 to present concerning the fabrication, staging, or simulation of violent incidents (including school shootings, workplace attacks, or self-immolation events) within the scope of Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) programs.

This includes:
	•	Research proposals, internal reports, or pilot programs evaluating the use of synthetic or staged violent incidents as part of CVE interventions, training exercises, or risk modeling.
	•	Communications or oversight documents regarding the deliberate use of fabricated or synthetic provocation events to influence behavioral responses in at-risk or activist populations.
	•	Analyses of copycat or contagion effects from staged or synthetic incidents, especially where such incidents were framed as authentic in public-facing materials.
	•	Records of CVE-related datasets that include or rely upon simulated violent events for predictive modeling of extremism or radicalization pathways.
	•	Any program reviews, audits, or Inspector General investigations assessing the ethics, legality, or behavioral impact of using synthetic provocation materials under CVE initiatives.

Keywords: Countering Violent Extremism, CVE synthetic provocation, staged violent incident, simulated school shooting, synthetic activist suicide, behavioral contagion modeling, fabricated extremist event, predictive CVE dataset

FOIA: Synthetic Provocation Events in Youth-Focused CVE Programs

To: Department of Homeland Security / Department of Justice / Federal Bureau of Investigation / Department of Defense / Office of the Director of National Intelligence

Request:
Requesting any and all records, contracts, communications, or interagency agreements from 2008 to present concerning the fabrication, staging, or simulation of violent incidents for use within youth-targeted Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) programs.

This includes:
	•	Research proposals, internal reports, or pilot projects exploring the use of staged or synthetic school shootings, violent outbursts, or activist suicides as training materials or “prevention” interventions in school or university settings.
	•	Records of school partnerships, youth CVE outreach programs, or behavioral modeling efforts involving simulated violent incidents presented as authentic.
	•	Analyses of the psychological or behavioral effects on youth populations exposed to staged violent events under the guise of prevention, resilience training, or radicalization deterrence.
	•	Datasets or predictive modeling projects that incorporate synthetic violent incidents involving youth populations for the purpose of CVE risk assessment.
	•	Oversight documents, Inspector General reviews, or ethical assessments concerning the legality and safety of deploying synthetic provocation events in youth CVE contexts.

Keywords: CVE school prevention, youth radicalization modeling, staged school shooting, synthetic activist suicide, fabricated violent incident, CVE resilience training, behavioral contagion youth datasets
