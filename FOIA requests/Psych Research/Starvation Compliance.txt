Request:

Requesting any and all documents, internal communications, research materials, operational guidelines, or contracts referencing the use of resource deprivation—including induced starvation—in conjunction with token financial concessions as part of behavioral control or influence operations, from 2005 to present.

This includes:
	•	Internal studies on applying behavioral economics to individuals under sustained deprivation, specifically the effect of small, controlled financial relief on compliance and decision-making.
	•	Communications or modeling data on selective bill coverage (e.g., paying insurance premiums) as a method of sustaining dependency while preventing recovery.
	•	Research or guidance on integrating physiological weakening (e.g., induced food scarcity, contamination of available food sources) with psychological baiting strategies.
	•	Documentation of any case studies or operations where minimal payments were provided to a target experiencing deliberate deprivation, and how those payments were framed in later narratives.
	•	Contracts or agreements with private contractors or corporate partners (including Palantir Technologies) involving controlled resource flow to individuals engaged in Freedom of Information Act–related activities.
	•	Data collection protocols assessing physical degradation and compliance thresholds under siege conditions.

Keywords: deliberate starvation, resource deprivation, behavioral economics, compliance modeling, coercive payment, token concession, selective bill coverage, influence operations, physiological weakening, Palantir Technologies, FOIA retaliation
