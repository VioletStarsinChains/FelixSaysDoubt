Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, contracts, internal communications, reports, or contractor deliverables from 1990 to present referencing sky augmentation technologies and associated behavioral modeling.

This includes:
	•	Ground-based, aerial, or orbital systems for projection, light patterning, or atmospheric image generation (including simulation of astronomical features, clouds, auroras, or other sky phenomena)
	•	Field trials or demonstrations of augmented or altered sky conditions for training, public communication, deception, or environmental simulation purposes
	•	Studies or models assessing the psychological, behavioral, or physiological effects of altered sky conditions on civilian or military populations
	•	Interagency or contractor collaborations evaluating public perception management through visual sky augmentation
	•	Post-event analyses of behavioral or operational outcomes during or after deployment of sky augmentation systems in populated areas

Keywords: sky augmentation, atmospheric projection, aerial projection, orbital projection, artificial aurora, cloud simulation, astronomical simulation, environmental imagery, behavioral modeling, perception management, DARPA, NASA, DoD, NOAA

To: Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)

Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, contracts, internal communications, reports, or contractor deliverables from 1990 to present referencing sky augmentation technologies in the context of non-kinetic influence operations or human domain effects.

This includes:
	•	Ground-based, aerial, or orbital projection systems used to simulate, obscure, or modify astronomical features, cloud cover, auroras, or other sky phenomena in operational or test environments
	•	Integration of sky augmentation with psychological operations (PSYOP), perception management, or civilian behavior shaping initiatives
	•	Behavioral modeling projects evaluating population-level or targeted individual responses to altered sky conditions
	•	Field trials or demonstrations where augmented sky imagery was deployed alongside data collection on communication patterns, movement, compliance, or incident rates
	•	Interagency collaborations involving DARPA and DoD branches, DHS, NASA, or NOAA on dual-use sky augmentation systems with both environmental and human domain applications

Keywords: sky augmentation, atmospheric projection, aerial projection, orbital projection, astronomical simulation, artificial aurora, cloud simulation, perception management, non-kinetic influence, human domain effects, DARPA
