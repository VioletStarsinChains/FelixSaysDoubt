Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, internal communications, meeting notes, experimental protocols, or contractor deliverables from January 1, 1970 to present referencing:
	1.	The Ganzfeld Effect — including visual, auditory, or multisensory methods of inducing sensory homogenization and any associated applications for interrogation, sensory isolation, psychological operations, cognitive manipulation, or enhancement of externally guided imagery.
	2.	Perceptual Divergence Phenomena — including but not limited to viral or large-scale cases such as “the dress” (blue/black vs. white/gold), “Laurel vs. Yanny,” motion-induced blindness, bistable illusions (e.g., Necker cube, Rubin’s vase), checker shadow illusion, color phi phenomenon, and related laboratory or field illusions.

This includes:
	•	Research into using perceptual divergence or the Ganzfeld Effect to enable or enhance synthetic hallucinations, augmented reality overlays, or target-specific perceptual manipulation.
	•	Experiments assessing susceptibility to controlled perceptual disagreement or bistable imagery under operational conditions.
	•	Contracts or grants awarded to private sector or academic partners investigating perceptual divergence or Ganzfeld-based techniques.
	•	Cross-agency communications discussing the operational relevance of perceptual divergence phenomena and the Ganzfeld Effect in intelligence, defense, or law enforcement contexts.
	•	Any datasets, imagery, audio, or AR/VR content derived from or inspired by the above phenomena.

Keywords: Ganzfeld Effect, sensory homogenization, perceptual divergence, bistable perception, synthetic hallucination, augmented reality overlay, sensory isolation, viral visual illusion, DARPA, IARPA, human factors, target-specific manipulation
