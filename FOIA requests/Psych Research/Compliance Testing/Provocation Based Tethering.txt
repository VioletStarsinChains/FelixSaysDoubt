Request:

Requesting any and all contracts, research proposals, interagency communications, or oversight documents from 1990 to present regarding the use of provocation-based behavioral tethering mechanisms in counterterrorism, counterintelligence, or neurotechnology research programs.

This request specifically seeks:
	•	Pilot programs or studies involving the use of simulated or controlled violent acts (including homicide scenarios) as compliance anchors in long-term behavioral research subjects.
	•	Communications or policy documents referencing the use of staged or synthetic events to induce subject guilt, complicity, or perceived culpability for purposes of continued surveillance or experimentation.
	•	Records discussing the ethical, legal, or operational rationale for tethering subjects via induced violent actions or simulated criminal events.
	•	Proposals linking provocation-based tethering to predictive analytics, behavioral futures markets, or other long-term modeling platforms.
	•	Oversight reports or internal evaluations concerning the psychological or compliance impacts of such methods on research or surveillance populations.

Keywords: provocation-based tethering, compliance anchors, simulated violent acts, induced culpability, synthetic event provocation, behavioral compliance mechanisms, long-term surveillance tethering, subject guilt manipulation.

Request:

Requesting any and all contracts, research proposals, interagency communications, or oversight documents from 1990 to present regarding the use of “kill-to-bind” provocation mechanisms in behavioral research, surveillance programs, or neurotechnology trafficking contexts.

This includes:
	•	Records describing how subjects may be induced to commit real or synthetic homicide as a method of ensuring permanent compliance, guilt tethering, or “lifetime access” for surveillance and experimentation.
	•	Documents analyzing the use of synthetic constructs, fabricated atrocity scenarios, or staged violent events as triggers for binding research populations into long-term telemetry contracts.
	•	Interagency communications on how induced violence serves as a transferable futures asset — i.e., where compliance rights over a subject are treated as tradable contracts in behavioral futures markets.
	•	Proposals linking “kill-to-bind” mechanisms to Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) programs, predictive modeling frameworks, or neurotechnology subject pools.
	•	Oversight or ethical reviews discussing whether induced violent acts (real or synthetic) are used as permanent compliance anchors for research or surveillance populations.

Keywords: kill-to-bind mechanism, provocation compliance, neurotech trafficking, induced homicide scenarios, lifetime subject tethering, transferable compliance contracts, synthetic atrocity provocation, behavioral futures markets.
