To: [Likely agencies: DARPA / IARPA / DHS S&T Directorate / NIH BRAIN Initiative / Department of Defense Human Performance Wing]

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, internal communications, or contractor agreements from 2005 to present referencing evaluation or field-testing of visual-cognitive load interventions in real-world work environments involving repetitive or route-based tasks.

This includes:
	•	Studies on the impact of altered or augmented environmental stimuli on human task performance and error rates
	•	Field trials involving perceptual modification technologies in civilian or commercial work settings
	•	Research on cognitive resilience testing using controlled environmental variables
	•	Reports on integration of synthetic or simulated visual elements into operational settings for performance assessment
	•	Communications regarding partnerships with private sector employers to test such interventions in live work contexts

Keywords: environmental stimulus modulation, visual load testing, synthetic perceptual input, operational cognitive stressors, route-based task performance, augmented work environment, perceptual resilience, simulated environmental cues

To: U.S. Army Research Laboratory / U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory / DARPA / Naval Research Laboratory

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, test reports, after-action reviews, or contractor agreements from 2001 to present referencing assessment of soldier performance in training or operational environments where ambient conditions or visual cues were deliberately modified for evaluation purposes.

This includes:
	•	Field exercises involving altered terrain features, nonstandard environmental lighting, or inserted visual elements to assess reaction and decision-making under uncertainty
	•	Research on human factors impacts of simulated or ambiguous environmental cues during patrols, guard duty, or route-based tasks
	•	Reports on the integration of augmented reality or “battlefield shaping” technologies into live training ranges
	•	Data on unit cohesion, situational awareness, and accuracy when exposed to controlled, variable environmental stimuli
	•	Communications regarding coordination with defense contractors or allied militaries to develop such field evaluation protocols

Keywords: environmental cue modification, visual ambiguity training, human factors in altered terrain, synthetic battlefield elements, operational cognitive resilience, perception-based stress testing, augmented field environment, situational awareness modulation
