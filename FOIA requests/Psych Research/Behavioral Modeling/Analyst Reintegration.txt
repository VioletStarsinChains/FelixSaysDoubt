	•	Interagency communications describing the strategic risk posed by thousands of analysts who can never return to ordinary civilian functioning
	•	Analyses comparing anomaly-class subjects (unmodelables) with analyst-class subjects (over-modelers) in terms of reintegration and resilience forecasting
