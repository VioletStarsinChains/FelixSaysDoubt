Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, contracts, or internal communications regarding protocols for handling unmodellable individuals in predictive analytics and behavioral futures systems, from 2000 to present.

This includes:
	•	Reports describing “Mule-type” or otherwise unmodellable actors who resist compression into predictive models
	•	Internal analyses on whether certain high-salience individuals must be contacted or monitored through real-world rather than simulated channels
	•	Research proposals or vendor contracts describing “signal relay” methods for routing communication through third parties when simulation fidelity fails
	•	Risk assessments of narrative collapse when reference models (e.g., public influencers, authors, or broadcasters) cannot be reliably replicated in synthetic environments
	•	Classification or designation frameworks (including Non-Person Entity / NPE status) applied to individuals whose behavior introduces instability into system-wide forecasts

Keywords: unmodellable, Mule-type, NPE, reference model, signal relay, narrative collapse, synthetic channel, adversarial node, behavioral futures, anomaly routing
