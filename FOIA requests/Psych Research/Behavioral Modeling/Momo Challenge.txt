To Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) / Department of Justice (DOJ) / Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, case files, communications, or research studies from 2017 to present regarding the “Momo Challenge” viral scare, particularly as a potential synthetic construct seeded or amplified for behavioral futures modeling and population susceptibility testing.

This includes:
	•	Records analyzing whether the “Momo” phenomenon was intentionally introduced or amplified as a follow-up to Slenderman, with a shift from forum-based mythos to short-form viral distribution and parental panic channels
	•	Documentation of research into how quickly belief in synthetic dangers can spread among children, parents, schools, and media when the construct leverages pre-existing communication networks (YouTube, WhatsApp, viral news cycles)
	•	Internal reports on the use of Momo as a test case for entrainment via visual archetypes, especially among vulnerable populations such as children and adolescents
	•	Communications between FBI, DOJ, and HHS discussing the classification of the Momo incident as an organic hoax versus a deliberately seeded narrative weaponization campaign
	•	Interagency correspondence regarding how the incident informed future predictive modeling efforts on susceptibility, panic propagation, and the behavioral effects of belief in synthetic archetypes

Keywords: Momo Challenge, synthetic construct, narrative weaponization, viral panic, adolescent entrainment, belief formation, Slenderman follow-up, behavioral futures modeling
