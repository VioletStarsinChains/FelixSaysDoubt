Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, contracts, internal communications, reports, datasets, or contractor deliverables from 1998 to 2001 referencing public behavior, system performance, or environmental conditions during the Year 2000 (Y2K) event period.

This includes:
	•	Analyses of population behavior (e.g., purchasing patterns, travel behavior, communication volume) in the months before, during, and after January 1, 2000
	•	Modeling or simulation of psychological and behavioral responses to Y2K-related messaging or anticipated infrastructure disruption
	•	Data collection or analysis of retail, financial, telecommunications, or transportation system usage during the Y2K transition window
	•	Environmental monitoring or testing conducted under the Y2K operational cover, including gravitational gradient, electromagnetic, or atmospheric field variation studies
	•	Interagency or contractor collaborations combining infrastructure performance data with behavioral modeling for contingency planning or human domain analysis
	•	Post-event reports evaluating Y2K as a large-scale live trial for crisis communication, public compliance, or environmental safety measures

Keywords: Year 2000, Y2K, behavioral modeling, infrastructure stress test, population response, system performance, environmental variation, gravitational gradient, electromagnetic environment, contingency planning, human domain effects, DARPA, DoD, FEMA, DHS, NASA
