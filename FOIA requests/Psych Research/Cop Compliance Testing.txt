To Department of Justice (DOJ) / Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) / Department of Homeland Security (DHS) / DHS Science & Technology Directorate (S&T)

Request:

Requesting any and all reports, research proposals, contracts, pilot program documentation, or interagency communications from January 1, 2005 to present concerning the use of augmented reality (AR), mixed reality, or perceptual overlay technologies to modify, substitute, or present law enforcement officer appearance (e.g., race, age, gender, body type, or other archetypal features) for behavioral modeling of civilian response.

This includes:
	•	Human factors studies measuring compliance, resistance, or escalation during civilian encounters with AR-altered officer avatars
	•	Pilot programs or field tests where officer appearance is digitally modified to test archetype-specific outcomes in crowd control, homeless outreach, or traffic enforcement
	•	Communications with law enforcement agencies, defense contractors, or technology vendors regarding perceptual overlays used in officer presentation
	•	Reports or audits concerning the ethical, legal, or civil liberties implications of deploying AR-altered officer identities in public space
	•	Interagency discussions of predictive modeling derived from officer archetype testing (e.g., compliance profiling, escalation thresholds, demographic targeting)

Keywords: law enforcement AR, perceptual overlay, officer archetypes, compliance modeling, behavioral testing, identity substitution, mixed reality policing, DHS S&T, DOJ behavioral research, crowd control overlays

To Department of Defense (DoD) / Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) / Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) / Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA)

Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, contracts, program descriptions, evaluation reports, privacy/ethics reviews, or interagency communications from January 1, 2005 to present concerning the use of augmented reality (AR), mixed reality, or perceptual overlay systems to modify or substitute law enforcement officer appearance (e.g., race, gender, age, body type, or attractiveness archetype) for purposes of compliance testing, behavioral modeling, or population-level prediction.

This includes:
	•	Human factors studies on civilian compliance, resistance, or escalation when officer identity is altered through AR overlays or avatar substitution
	•	Program documentation evaluating which officer archetypes produce the strongest predictive signals across different demographic groups of civilians
	•	Research on parasocial trust dynamics, perceived authority, and threat calibration in response to AR-modified officer archetypes
	•	Sensor fusion or data pipelines combining bodycam footage, mobile telemetry, surveillance feeds, and biometric data to quantify responses to officer appearance overlays
	•	Communications with contractors, technology vendors, or academic institutions conducting AR archetype testing in law enforcement or public safety contexts
	•	Ethical, legal, or civil liberties reviews concerning nondisclosure of AR identity substitution in public-facing law enforcement interactions

Keywords: DARPA behavioral modeling, IARPA compliance testing, AR officer archetypes, perceptual overlay policing, mixed reality identity substitution, predictive policing, authority archetypes, population-level compliance, escalation dynamics, civil liberties review
