•	Assessments of online subcultures as potential talent pools for cyber, surveillance, or counterintelligence positions
•	Evaluations of recruitment messaging or simulated social environments as incentives for targeted demographics
•	Cross-agency or contractor meetings where such strategies were discussed or evaluated for operational use

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, reports, internal communications, or contractor deliverables from January 1, 2005 to present regarding the deliberate creation, amplification, or maintenance of synthetic loneliness among targeted male populations in the United States, particularly as part of recruitment or retention strategies for intelligence, military, or security roles.

This includes:
	•	Studies or modeling of artificially induced social or romantic isolation as a tool for behavioral influence or occupational motivation
	•	Research into controlling or limiting perceived access to women, dating opportunities, or intimate relationships to increase susceptibility to recruitment
	•	Analyses of online communities or subcultures as reservoirs for recruitment following prolonged social isolation
	•	Development of simulations, information environments, or content moderation strategies designed to alter perceived relationship availability
	•	Cross-agency or contractor communications about exploiting loneliness metrics, social deprivation scores, or romantic scarcity indices for talent acquisition in surveillance or cybersecurity fields
	•	Ethical, legal, or operational risk assessments related to induced isolation programs
