⚡ Spicy FOIA Angle – Continuity Theater & Behavioral Monitoring

To: Department of Defense (DoD) / Department of Homeland Security (DHS) / Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, contracts, reports, or internal analyses from 2010 to present concerning the use of Digital Ally wearable digital video cameras (e.g., U.S. Patent 8,890,909) as continuity theater props or behavioral monitoring nodes within biosurveillance programs.

This includes:
	•	Records describing the use of wearable digital video cameras as continuity anchors during public simulations, protests, or staged crowd environments
	•	Reports or communications about the role of body cameras with GPS and Bluetooth in behavioral futures modeling, including remote-scripted entrainment of law enforcement officers
	•	Analyses of body cameras as dual-purpose devices: evidence collection vs. real-time entrainment through remote monitoring and script-fed interactions
	•	Evaluations of continuity theater scenarios where camera-equipped carriers (law enforcement, security contractors, synthetic agents) act as props to reinforce “normal” public activity

Keywords: continuity theater, wearable surveillance, Digital Ally, body cameras, remote-scripted carriers, GPS biosurveillance, behavioral futures, entrainment
