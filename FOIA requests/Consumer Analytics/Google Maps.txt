Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, or communications from January 1, 2003 to present concerning Palantir Technologies and Google Maps (including Alphabet/Google subsidiaries) in the context of compliance testing, behavioral futures markets, and predictive analytics.

This includes:
	•	Records analyzing Google Maps navigation as a compliance apparatus — specifically, whether users follow, resist, or deviate from suggested routes, and how this behavioral data is monetized or used for futures modeling.
	•	Communications or contracts documenting Palantir’s ingestion of Google Maps telemetry (location history, routing behavior, geofencing) into Gotham/Foundry or related platforms.
	•	Interagency or contractor discussions of Google Maps as a substrate for behavioral modeling, obedience scoring, or compliance horizon analysis (e.g., how long a user tolerates rerouting or delay).
	•	Documentation of joint R&D initiatives where Google Maps data is used to train predictive models for consumer compliance, urban policing, or financial speculation on human movement patterns.
	•	Any pilot projects or proposals treating Google Maps as an everyday behavioral lab for generating compliance signals later priced into markets.
