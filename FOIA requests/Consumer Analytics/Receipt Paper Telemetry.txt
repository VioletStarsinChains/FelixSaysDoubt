To FDA, CDC/NIOSH, and EPA

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, internal communications, research proposals, or contractor reports from 1990 to present concerning the health and behavioral impacts of thermal receipt paper, including coatings containing bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol S (BPS), or other chemical substitutes.

This includes:
	•	Internal toxicology or risk assessments of BPA/BPS-coated thermal paper
	•	Research into endocrine disruption, cognitive effects, or behavioral outcomes associated with chronic receipt handling (e.g., among cashiers or service workers)
	•	Communications with receipt paper manufacturers regarding regulatory thresholds, substitutions, or chemical disclosure
	•	Studies or reports on dermal absorption rates of BPA/BPS through receipt handling and potential neurobehavioral consequences
	•	Oversight reports or ethical reviews related to chemical exposures in consumer-facing retail environments

Keywords: receipt paper, BPA, BPS, endocrine disruptor, dermal absorption, cognitive effects, behavioral outcomes, thermal paper, FDA, NIOSH, EPA

To FTC, DHS (Science & Technology Directorate), and Treasury (Bureau of Engraving & Printing / counterfeit-prevention R&D)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, internal communications, or research proposals from 2000 to present regarding the use of thermal receipt paper or point-of-sale receipts as behavioral telemetry vectors, compliance tools, or data streams for predictive analytics.

This includes:
	•	Records on the use of printed receipts as behavioral logs (time-stamped, location-specific purchase data) for consumer modeling or futures markets
	•	Research into “smart receipt” technologies, including invisible inks, magnetic pigments, or coded microprinting for behavioral tagging
	•	Contracts or pilot programs involving private contractors (e.g., Palantir, Accenture, Booz Allen) analyzing receipt data for behavioral prediction or compliance anchoring
	•	Communications between DHS, FTC, or Treasury and major retailers regarding receipt data integration with predictive modeling platforms
	•	Oversight reports, audits, or risk assessments on the resale of receipt-derived behavioral data into commercial prediction markets

Keywords: receipt paper, behavioral telemetry, predictive modeling, compliance anchors, smart receipts, invisible ink, purchase data, behavioral futures markets
