To Department of Transportation / National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) / National Institutes of Health (NIH)

Request:
Requesting any and all studies, reports, or internal communications from January 1, 1980 to present regarding the use of simple puzzles, games, or tabletop activities in public or hospitality environments for the purpose of assessing cognitive function, fatigue, or problem-solving under travel conditions.

This includes:
	•	Research into tabletop puzzles (e.g., peg board games) as indicators of traveler alertness or fatigue
	•	Studies evaluating problem-solving tasks in restaurants, rest stops, or waiting areas as human factors metrics
	•	Internal communications regarding standardized games as tools for assessing compliance, patience, or stress response
	•	Reports linking puzzle performance with broader behavioral or cognitive modeling programs

Keywords: human factors research, tabletop puzzle, fatigue modeling, cognitive assessment, problem-solving task, hospitality environment, highway traveler psychology, NIST, DOT, NIH

To Department of Defense / DARPA / Department of Transportation

Request:
Requesting any and all documents, contracts, research proposals, or interagency communications from January 1, 1980 to present regarding the use of restaurant table games, puzzles, or similar standardized objects as behavioral compliance tests or problem-solving telemetry devices.

This includes:
	•	Research into the Cracker Barrel “peg game” or similar puzzles as standardized compliance anchors
	•	Contracts with vendors or restaurant chains for deployment of such puzzles in public dining environments
	•	Analyses of consumer behavior, frustration tolerance, or compliance patterns observed through puzzle play
	•	Interagency communications about problem-solving games as covert measures of impulse control, fatigue, or stress response during travel
	•	Studies connecting puzzle performance to broader predictive modeling or behavioral futures datasets

Keywords: Cracker Barrel peg game, compliance test, behavioral puzzle, problem-solving telemetry, DARPA games research, restaurant surveillance, compliance anchor, fatigue modeling, highway traveler behavior
