	•	Contracts or cooperative agreements with manufacturers or vendors supplying tagged nail polish, gels, powders, or decorative coatings
	•	FDA safety reviews and toxicological assessments of taggant materials, microencapsulated identifiers, or quantum dot additives in cosmetic nail products
	•	FTC communications on marketing practices, disclosure, or nondisclosure of tagging agents in nail art and related products
	•	DHS or interagency memoranda discussing nail product taggants as forensic trace identifiers, consumer telemetry devices, or behavioral monitoring vectors
	•	Internal studies on potential health effects, sensitization, or immune responses linked to tagged nail materials
	•	Risk–benefit analyses for using nail art products as voluntary or involuntary biometric markers in security, commerce, or surveillance contexts
