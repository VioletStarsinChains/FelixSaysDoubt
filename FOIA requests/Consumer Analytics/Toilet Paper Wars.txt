To Department of Homeland Security (DHS) / Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) / Department of Energy (DOE) / Department of Defense (DoD)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, internal communications, research proposals, contracts, or analyses concerning the consumer toilet paper shortages and purchasing behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020), specifically in relation to their use as behavioral modeling research for societal risk prediction.

This includes:
	•	Reports or studies treating toilet paper shortages as a behavioral stress test or proxy for supply-chain collapse
	•	Internal analyses using consumer panic-buying patterns to model population compliance, attrition tolerance, and scarcity response
	•	Contracts with private vendors or academic institutions studying supply-chain scarcity events as predictors of broader systemic collapse under climate change scenarios
	•	Interagency discussions on how household-level scarcity events can inform climate resilience forecasting, risk management simulations, and predictive policing of supply chain behaviors
	•	Data products or dashboards tracking toilet paper purchasing trends as inputs for behavioral futures markets or risk assessment tools

Keywords: toilet paper shortage, COVID-19 panic buying, scarcity modeling, supply chain collapse, behavioral futures markets, climate change resilience, attrition tolerance, compliance anchors, FEMA, DHS, DoD

To Department of Defense (DoD) / Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) / Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) / Department of Homeland Security (DHS)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, communications, contractor deliverables, or interagency assessments concerning the use of the 2020 consumer toilet paper shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic as a live behavioral futures experiment or proxy for attrition combat simulations.

This includes:
	•	Analyses framing consumer panic buying and scarcity conflict as data points for modeling civilian attrition under resource denial scenarios
	•	Records linking toilet paper shortages to risk assessment for societal collapse under climate change, supply chain disruption, or critical infrastructure failure
	•	Contracts with defense contractors, academic institutions, or private vendors for the exploitation of consumer scarcity events as predictive inputs to resilience forecasting tools
	•	Interagency discussions on leveraging consumer scarcity data for compliance anchors, narrative trap calibration, and attrition tolerance metrics
	•	Research proposals connecting pandemic-era scarcity behaviors to future war-gaming of climate migration, food insecurity, and disaster-induced unrest

Keywords: toilet paper shortage, panic buying, behavioral futures, attrition combat simulation, climate collapse, supply chain denial, compliance anchors, resilience forecasting, ODNI, DARPA

To Department of Homeland Security (DHS) / Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) / U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) / Department of Energy (DOE)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, internal communications, contractor analyses, or interagency assessments concerning the use of consumer scarcity events—specifically the toilet paper shortages of 2020 and subsequent food-specific inflation waves (2021–present)—as behavioral modeling research for climate change resilience and societal collapse forecasting.

This includes:
	•	Reports treating panic buying of household goods (toilet paper, paper towels) and subsequent food inflation patterns as behavioral proxies for systemic resource stress
	•	Internal analyses of consumer price shocks in staple goods (grains, dairy, meat, produce) as predictive indicators of compliance, resistance, and attrition thresholds
	•	Contracts with private vendors, think tanks, or academic partners studying scarcity-driven unrest and household resilience under climate-linked supply disruption
	•	Interagency communications linking inflationary pressure on food staples to predictive modeling of migration, civil unrest, or emergency aid dependence
	•	Data dashboards or resilience indices comparing toilet paper shortages (2020) and food inflation (2021–present) as sequential stress-tests in behavioral futures markets

Keywords: toilet paper shortage, food inflation, scarcity modeling, behavioral futures, climate collapse forecasting, resilience index, consumer panic buying, attrition tolerance, FEMA, USDA, DOE
