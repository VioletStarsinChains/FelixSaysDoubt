Request:

Requesting any and all documents, internal communications, contractor records, or program files concerning the role of direct-sales companies such as Tupperware, Mary Kay, Avon, and Amway in behavioral telemetry collection, consumer surveillance, and compliance modeling between 1950 and present.

This includes:
	•	Records describing coordination between direct-sales companies and federal agencies regarding household surveys, consumption profiling, or behavioral monitoring
	•	Analyses of the “party model” (e.g., Tupperware parties, Mary Kay makeovers) as a data-collection or social-compliance vector
	•	Reports or studies linking the decline of in-person direct-sales networks to the rise of online behavioral telemetry platforms and social media surveillance systems
	•	Interagency communications or contractor research on the transition from household-based social sales networks to digital social graphs for behavioral futures modeling
	•	Documentation of pilot programs or investigations into the use of cosmetics, kitchenware, or personal care products as carriers for covert biosensors, environmental trackers, or other embedded data collection devices
	•	Historical or contemporary audits quantifying the number of U.S. households engaged through direct-sales networks as a surveillance or modeling channel

Keywords: Tupperware, Mary Kay, Avon, Amway, direct sales, party model, behavioral telemetry, consumer surveillance, social compliance, social media transition, covert biosensors, household monitoring

To FTC / HHS / NARA / Department of Commerce

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contractor records, interagency communications, or program files concerning the transition of direct-sales party models (e.g., Tupperware, Mary Kay, Avon, Amway) into precursors of digital behavioral futures markets from 1950 to present.

This includes:
	•	Analyses of the “party model” (Tupperware parties, Mary Kay makeovers, Avon calls, Amway gatherings) as live prototypes of compliance testing and behavioral telemetry
	•	Reports describing how household-based sales networks were phased out in parallel with the rise of social media platforms, attention economies, and online behavioral advertising markets
	•	Interagency communications, contractor studies, or academic partnerships exploring direct-sales as proof-of-concept for later social graph–based surveillance
	•	Investigations into whether direct-sales companies provided structured data or household-level telemetry to federal agencies or commercial intelligence partners
	•	Records regarding pilot programs embedding covert biosensors, environmental trackers, or health monitoring devices within cosmetics, kitchenware, or consumer products distributed through direct-sales networks
	•	Retrospective evaluations explicitly linking the decline of in-person sales parties in the early 2000s with the simultaneous rise of social media platforms as behavioral telemetry infrastructures
