This includes:
	•	FBI and NIJ protocols for detection, spectral analysis, or forensic classification of tagged tattoo inks used as markers of identity, affiliation, or geographic presence
	•	Records of nanoparticle, isotopic, fluorescent, or polymer additives embedded in tattoo pigments for the purpose of long-term monitoring, dissident tracking, or behavioral telemetry
	•	FDA safety evaluations, toxicological reviews, or enforcement actions regarding undeclared taggant additives in tattoo inks marketed for consumer or professional use
	•	DHS S&T or DOJ Civil Rights Division communications regarding the equity, civil liberties, or civil rights impacts of using tattoo taggants in surveillance or forensic programs
	•	Vendor contracts, cooperative agreements, or SBIR/STTR grants with ink manufacturers, pigment suppliers, or chemical companies developing tagged formulations
	•	Interagency discussions about tattoos as voluntary or involuntary biometric markers, including use in compliance testing, protest/dissident surveillance, or identity verification programs
