To: University of Texas at Austin FOIA Officer

Request:

Pursuant to the Texas Public Information Act, I am requesting access to any and all records from 2010 to present referencing the following topics:

A. Drowning Deaths in Lady Bird Lake (Austin, TX)

Please include:
	•	Internal reports, communications, or correspondence referencing drowning incidents in Lady Bird Lake from 2010–2025.
	•	Any research studies, collaborations, or institutional partnerships analyzing these incidents.
	•	Involvement of campus departments (e.g., psychology, criminology, neuroscience, computer science) in collecting, reviewing, or interpreting data related to these deaths.
	•	Communications with city, state, or federal agencies regarding the increase in drowning deaths beginning around 2022.
	•	Any references to behavioral anomaly detection, predictive modeling, or environmental signal exposure in relation to these events.

B.  Cross-Species Cognitive Modeling, Behavioral Simulation, or Biofeedback Research

Please include:
	•	Research proposals, white papers, experimental protocols, or internal communications related to cross-species cognitive modeling (especially human-animal or animal-machine research).
	•	Programs involving real-time behavioral mirroring, feedback loops, or AI model training using non-human organisms as proxies for human cognition or response modeling.
	•	Any collaboration with federal agencies (e.g., DARPA, NSF, NIH) or private contractors (e.g., Palantir, OpenAI, Google Brain, DeepMind) involving comparative cognition, behavioral reinforcement studies, or neurosensory entrainment.
	•	Use of urban environments, public waterways, or publicly accessible sensors as testbeds for passive behavioral observation or modulation.

If any responsive documents are classified or partially redacted due to exemptions, I request an index of withheld documents along with justification under the relevant statute.

Keywords: Lady Bird Lake, cross-species modeling, comparative cognition, anomalous death cluster,  AI simulation cohort, biofeedback loop, animal proxy training, environmental cognitive modeling, neurocognitive divergence

Request:
Under the Freedom of Information Act, I am requesting access to any and all documents from 2010 to present relating to the following areas:

A. Behavioral Modeling Using Real-World Environmental Inputs in Austin, Texas

Please include:
	•	Internal communications, research proposals, white papers, or grant agreements referencing the use of Austin, TX or Lady Bird Lake as a behavioral observation environment.
	•	Field deployments involving behavioral reinforcement loops, urban signal entrainment, or unsheltered/anomalous population monitoring in the Austin metro.
	•	Studies or proposals that involve mapping risk behaviors, behavioral anomalies, or induced dissociation in urban locations near public bodies of water.

B. Cross-Species Cognitive Modeling and Proxy Training Programs

Please include:
	•	Research involving comparative cognition, biofeedback loops, or cross-species simulations used to train AI or behavioral prediction systems.
	•	Programs using animals as cognitive proxies for human neurodivergent populations.
	•	Funding documentation for UT-Austin, TACC (Texas Advanced Computing Center), or any affiliated labs conducting cross-species cognition or cognitive entrainment studies.
	•	Any materials describing or referencing the use of real-world urban environments (e.g., lakes, sidewalks, public parks) as behavioral testing or data collection zones.
C.  Relevant Program References

Please include any mention of:
	•	BTO (Biological Technologies Office) programs
	•	PREventing EMerging Pathologic Behavior (PREEMPT)
	•	Next-Generation Nonsurgical Neurotechnology (N³)
	•	RE-NET
	•	Narrative Entrainment Projects
	•	Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)
	•	AI-human alignment via environmental modeling

If any responsive materials are withheld or redacted, I request an index and justification of exemptions under 5 U.S.C. § 552.
