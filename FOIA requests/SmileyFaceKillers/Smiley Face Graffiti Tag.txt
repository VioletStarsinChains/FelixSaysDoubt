To Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) / Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU) / National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, internal communications, or interagency correspondence from 1990 to present referencing the use, analysis, or psychological impact of the “smiley face” symbol or similar graphic marks in criminal investigations, behavioral threat assessment, or public perception studies.

This includes:
	•	Analyses of graffiti or symbolic markings associated with drowning incidents or suspected serial homicides (including the so-called “Smiley Face Killer” theory)
	•	Research on the alteration of public perception or emotional valence of commonly positive symbols through contextual association with violence or death
	•	Studies or contracts involving synthetic imagery, augmented reality, or staged visual cues in criminal investigation simulations
	•	Symbol affect reversal research in law enforcement training or psychological operations contexts
	•	Collaboration records with academic institutions, defense contractors, or intelligence agencies on semiotics and symbol-driven behavioral influence
	•	Procurement or deployment records for technology capable of inserting or modifying visual symbols in recorded or live visual feeds

Keywords: smiley face graffiti, symbol affect reversal, semiotics, behavioral influence, affective priming, synthetic imagery, augmented reality, forensic graffiti, FBI BAU, NCAVC

To National Science Foundation (NSF)

Request:

Requesting any and all grant proposals, funded project summaries, progress reports, final reports, or internal communications from 1990 to present referencing the study of the “smiley face” symbol or other culturally positive graphic marks in the context of perception, emotion, or behavioral influence.

This includes:
	•	Research on affective priming or emotional valence modification of symbols, especially shifting a positive or neutral symbol to a negative association through context or repeated pairing with adverse stimuli
	•	Studies of semiotics, cultural iconography, or graphic symbols in applied psychology, cognitive science, or human factors research
	•	Projects investigating graffiti or symbolic markings as variables in behavioral analysis or forensic psychology
	•	Research involving synthetic imagery, augmented reality, or other perceptual manipulation technologies that insert or alter symbols in real or recorded environments
	•	Grants or sub-awards to universities, research institutes, or private contractors for symbol-based behavioral influence studies
	•	Collaboration records with law enforcement, defense, or intelligence agencies on the perception or meaning-shifting of graphic symbols
