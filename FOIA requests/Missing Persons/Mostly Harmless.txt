This request includes but is not limited to:
	•	Behavioral modeling or psychographic profiling documents produced during the period of his known travel (2017–2018)
	•	Communications between federal or contracted intelligence personnel regarding the unusual nature of his identity, disappearance, or biometric status
	•	Documents referencing him as a test subject, anomaly, or behavioral outlier
	•	Any internal analyses involving his refusal to carry ID, use technology, or disclose personal information
	•	Any associations with predictive containment experiments, social simulation datasets, or “reference model” terminology

Keywords: Mostly Harmless, Denim, Ben Bilemy, Florida Trail, Big Cypress, neurocognitive anomaly, test subject, behavioral outlier, reference model, unidentifiable, containment failure, silent experiment, predictive modeling

29.  To: FBI, DHS, DoD, and any agencies or contractors involved in biometric identification, including Palantir and Clearview AI

Request:

Requesting all records, internal communications, reports, or contractor deliverables related to biometric identification attempts of the unidentified deceased male found in Big Cypress National Preserve in July 2018, widely known as “Mostly Harmless,” “Denim,” or “Ben Bilemy.”

This includes but is not limited to:
	•	Facial recognition attempts through systems such as Palantir Gotham, Clearview AI, or any FBI or DHS biometric tools

	•	References to systemic weaknesses, algorithmic blind spots, or edge cases revealed by this incident
	•	Any training material, presentations, or case studies using this individual as an example of biometric misidentification or non-identifiability
