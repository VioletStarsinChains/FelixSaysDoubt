To: Department of Defense / DARPA / BARDA / CIA

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, or contracts related to the testing of synthetic hallucinations in wilderness survival scenarios, from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Internal reports on the deployment of non-physical objects (e.g., boulders, barriers) or figures (e.g., guides, companions) in wilderness conditions
	•	Documentation of subject responses to entrapment, coercion, or abandonment under synthetic sensory conditions
	•	Communications regarding data monetization through behavioral futures markets, particularly relating to survival thresholds and compliance behaviors
	•	Risk analyses concerning long-term psychological impact or fatalities resulting from wilderness-based synthetic hallucination field testing

Keywords: synthetic hallucination, wilderness simulation, entrapment scenario, coercive abandonment, behavioral futures markets, neurotech projection, survival threshold, compliance modeling, DARPA, BARDA

To: Department of Defense / DARPA / BARDA / CIA / DOJ

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, internal communications, or vendor partnerships involving the use of synthetic hallucinations or field simulations in which a non-physical human figure is introduced as a social or sexual coercion variable, particularly resembling cases where women were abandoned or died after hiking with a male companion (e.g., Camelback Mountain, 2021).

This includes:
	•	Protocols for generating synthetic human companions or guides as experimental controls in wilderness survival contexts
	•	Communications regarding the modeling of coercion, abandonment, or refusal scenarios as predictive analytics data
	•	Reports on gendered compliance studies testing survival outcomes after rejection of coercive offers
	•	Any contracts or research with private contractors on the valuation of autonomy vs. survival in behavioral futures markets

Keywords: synthetic hallucination, wilderness abandonment, coercive companion, Angela Tramonte, Camelback Mountain, social coercion, predictive modeling, behavioral futures markets, neurotech projection, survival autonomy
