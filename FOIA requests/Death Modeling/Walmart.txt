Request:

Requesting any and all records, reports, internal communications, or investigations regarding Walmart Inc. and its associated distribution centers, warehouses, logistics subcontractors, or third-party labor providers in connection with employee or contractor injury and death rates, from 2000 to present, with particular emphasis on how this data is used for predictive modeling of risk and mortality outcomes.

This includes:
	•	OSHA inspection reports, citations, and fatality investigations involving Walmart-operated warehouses and distribution centers, as well as third-party logistics providers contracted by Walmart
	•	Analyses, audits, or risk assessments correlating Walmart’s injury and death rates with industry-wide mortality modeling or workforce survivability projections
	•	Communications concerning the use of injury/fatality data from Walmart operations in predictive analytics, casualty simulations, or behavioral risk modeling frameworks
	•	Documents discussing how Walmart’s reliance on subcontractors, temporary labor, and productivity quotas contributes to statistical modeling of human performance limits, safety failures, and death-rate forecasting
	•	Internal or interagency reports evaluating whether Walmart’s occupational safety data has secondary applications in behavioral futures markets, disaster survival prediction, or population-level risk modeling
