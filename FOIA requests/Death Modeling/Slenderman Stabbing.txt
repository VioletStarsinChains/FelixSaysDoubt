To Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) / Department of Justice (DOJ) / Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, case files, communications, or research studies from 2008 to present regarding the 2014 Slenderman stabbing in Waukesha, Wisconsin, particularly in connection with synthetic experiences, behavioral modeling, or neurotechnology-enabled perception manipulation.

This includes:
	•	Records analyzing whether exposure to Slenderman-related online content was leveraged as a test environment for synthetic hallucinations, immersive cognitive entrainment, or behavioral compliance modeling in minors
	•	Documentation of federal or contractor research into the role of creepypasta forums, online horror narratives, and ARG-style communities as staging grounds for experimental susceptibility testing
	•	Internal analyses of how anomalous or vulnerable populations (such as adolescents) respond to synthetic archetypes and fictional constructs treated as real
	•	Communications between FBI, DOJ, and HHS regarding the classification of this incident as isolated pathology versus possible outcome of experimental narrative entrainment programs
	•	Reports addressing the potential use of the case as a pilot study for how belief in synthetic constructs can lead to real-world violent behavior, useful in predictive modeling for behavioral futures markets

Keywords: Slenderman stabbing, synthetic hallucination, creepypasta experimentation, narrative entrainment, ARG susceptibility, adolescent compliance testing, behavioral futures modeling, synthetic archetype violence

To Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) / Department of Justice (DOJ) / Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, case files, communications, or research studies from 2008 to present regarding the deliberate seeding of synthetic constructs such as “Slenderman” into online communities, particularly as test vectors for behavioral futures modeling and susceptibility to violent compliance.

This includes:
	•	Records acknowledging government or contractor involvement in the creation, amplification, or monitoring of Slenderman-related media as a synthetic archetype for cognitive entrainment experiments
	•	Documentation analyzing the 2014 Waukesha stabbing as a case study in deliberate narrative implantation and how fictional constructs can override normative reality testing in adolescents
	•	Reports on the use of creepypasta forums, ARG communities, or other user-generated content spaces as controlled laboratories for studying belief formation, obedience, and susceptibility to synthetic hallucinations
	•	Communications between FBI, DOJ, and HHS addressing ethical considerations of testing violent compliance modeling through seeded synthetic mythologies
	•	Interagency correspondence referencing the broader strategic use of synthetic archetypes (Slenderman, Momo, etc.) as tools for shaping population behavior and informing predictive modeling markets

Keywords: Slenderman experiment, synthetic construct seeding, narrative weaponization, compliance testing, ARG susceptibility, violent archetype modeling, adolescent entrainment, behavioral futures manipulation
