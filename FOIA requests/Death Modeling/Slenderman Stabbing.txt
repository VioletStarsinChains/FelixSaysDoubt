To Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) / Department of Justice (DOJ) / Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, case files, communications, or research studies from 2008 to present regarding the 2014 Slenderman stabbing in Waukesha, Wisconsin, particularly in connection with synthetic experiences, behavioral modeling, or neurotechnology-enabled perception manipulation.

This includes:
	•	Records analyzing whether exposure to Slenderman-related online content was leveraged as a test environment for synthetic hallucinations, immersive cognitive entrainment, or behavioral compliance modeling in minors
	•	Documentation of federal or contractor research into the role of creepypasta forums, online horror narratives, and ARG-style communities as staging grounds for experimental susceptibility testing
	•	Internal analyses of how anomalous or vulnerable populations (such as adolescents) respond to synthetic archetypes and fictional constructs treated as real
	•	Communications between FBI, DOJ, and HHS regarding the classification of this incident as isolated pathology versus possible outcome of experimental narrative entrainment programs
	•	Reports addressing the potential use of the case as a pilot study for how belief in synthetic constructs can lead to real-world violent behavior, useful in predictive modeling for behavioral futures markets

Keywords: Slenderman stabbing, synthetic hallucination, creepypasta experimentation, narrative entrainment, ARG susceptibility, adolescent compliance testing, behavioral futures modeling, synthetic archetype violence
