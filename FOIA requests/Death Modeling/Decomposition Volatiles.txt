To Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) / National Institutes of Health (NIH) / Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) / Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, studies, contracts, or internal communications concerning the monitoring, public health effects, and environmental impacts of decomposition-associated volatiles (including but not limited to putrescine, cadaverine, indole, and skatole) in residential, occupational, or public environments, from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Research on the occurrence and concentration of decomposition-related volatiles in urban or semi-urban environments
	•	Studies on the health risks of human or animal exposure to low-level airborne putrescine, cadaverine, indole, or skatole
	•	Contracts with universities, public health labs, or private contractors for odorant monitoring and population health impact studies
	•	Reports or internal communications concerning decomposition volatiles as environmental indicators (e.g., sanitation failures, disaster sites, morgue emissions)
	•	Incident reports, environmental sampling data, or remediation guidelines for public spaces where these compounds have been detected

Keywords: putrescine, cadaverine, indole, skatole, decomposition volatiles, environmental monitoring, odorants, public health exposure, urban sanitation, CDC air sampling

To Department of Defense / DARPA / Department of Homeland Security / NIH / EPA

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, studies, contracts, or internal communications concerning the use of decomposition-associated volatiles (including but not limited to putrescine, cadaverine, indole, skatole, and related compounds) as behavioral entrainment or population-level conditioning tools in public or semi-public environments, from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Research on the psychological, neurological, or immunological effects of human or animal decomposition volatiles on exposed populations
	•	Studies on disgust priming, anxiety induction, or compliance shifts caused by subthreshold or overt exposure to putrescine, cadaverine, or indole-class volatiles
	•	Contracts or collaborations with private contractors, universities, or defense labs testing decomposition volatiles as malodorants, non-lethal weapons, or crowd-control agents
	•	Internal communications regarding the ethical, health, or continuity risks of deploying decomposition-related volatiles in public environments
	•	Environmental monitoring data, incident reports, or risk assessments concerning population-level exposure to these compounds outside laboratory or mortuary settings

Keywords: putrescine, cadaverine, indole, skatole, decomposition volatiles, malodorants, behavioral entrainment, disgust priming, non-lethal weapons, public exposure, DARPA odorant research
