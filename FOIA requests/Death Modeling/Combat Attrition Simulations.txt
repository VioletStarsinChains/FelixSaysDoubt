To: Department of Defense (DoD) / Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, contracts, or internal communications regarding the use of civilian populations or civilian data as proxies for combat attrition simulations or casualty modeling, from 2000 to present.

This includes:
	•	Studies, models, or simulations that incorporate civilian workforce injury, illness, or mortality data into defense-related casualty or attrition forecasts
	•	Research proposals exploring the use of civilian occupational telemetry (e.g., warehousing, logistics, or industrial work) as analogues for battlefield stress, survivability, or fatigue modeling
	•	Communications or reports describing the ethical considerations, approvals, or restrictions related to civilian data in military attrition modeling
	•	Documents discussing the use of consumer behavior datasets, public health outcomes, or disaster response patterns as inputs for attrition simulations or synthetic population war-gaming
	•	Contracts with private sector partners (e.g., major retailers, logistics companies, data brokers) providing access to civilian data streams for purposes of casualty prediction or combat attrition scenario testing

Keywords: combat attrition, casualty modeling, civilian proxy data, workforce telemetry, survivability modeling, synthetic populations, casualty projection, DARPA, Department of Defense, behavioral futures, mortality simulation

To: Department of Defense (DoD) / Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, contracts, or internal communications regarding the non-consensual use of civilian populations, workplaces, or consumer datasets in combat attrition simulations, casualty modeling, or related mortality forecasting, from 2000 to present.

This includes:
	•	Research or contracts describing the use of civilian workforce injury, illness, or death records (e.g., warehousing, logistics, manufacturing) as inputs for combat attrition or battlefield survivability simulations
	•	Documents analyzing civilian disaster response, evacuation failure, or consumer preparedness data as analogues for attrition in military populations
	•	Internal communications discussing the ethical, legal, or reputational risks of using civilians as test subjects or proxy datasets for casualty prediction without informed consent
	•	Reports evaluating whether civilian behavioral telemetry (purchase patterns, compliance rates, kinesthetic data, etc.) can be leveraged in synthetic population models of warfighting attrition
	•	Any interagency discussions or partnerships with corporations, insurers, or data brokers regarding the repurposing of civilian surveillance streams for death-modeling or combat loss forecasting

Keywords: combat attrition, casualty simulation, non-consensual civilian experimentation, mortality forecasting, behavioral futures, synthetic populations, workforce telemetry, DARPA, Department of Defense, consent, casualty projection

To: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) / National Institutes of Health (NIH)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, research proposals, or internal communications referencing the use of civilian health, occupational, or population data in casualty modeling, attrition simulations, or survivability research with potential defense applications, from 2000 to present.

This includes:
	•	NIH or HHS-funded studies on workforce injury, illness, or mortality patterns that have been applied to military casualty prediction models
	•	Research exploring the use of public health data or disaster preparedness outcomes in attrition simulations or synthetic population forecasting
	•	Communications with the Department of Defense (DoD), DARPA, or other defense agencies concerning dual-use applications of NIH- or HHS-funded research for combat survivability modeling
	•	Reports evaluating how population-level biomedical or behavioral data may be used in attrition or mortality simulations

Keywords: attrition modeling, casualty forecasting, survivability research, civilian health data, dual-use, synthetic populations, workforce mortality, HHS, NIH, defense applications

This includes:
	•	NIH or HHS-supported studies where civilian morbidity, mortality, or workforce injury data were shared with or repurposed by defense agencies for attrition or survivability modeling
	•	Research analyzing civilian disaster outcomes, evacuation failures, or preparedness levels as analogues for battlefield loss scenarios
	•	Communications between NIH/HHS and the Department of Defense, DARPA, or affiliated contractors concerning repurposing of public health or medical data for combat casualty simulations
	•	Reports or ethics reviews discussing the implications of using civilian behavioral telemetry, health surveillance, or population datasets for death-modeling without informed consent
	•	Contracts with corporations, data brokers, or research institutions enabling the dual-use of medical or behavioral research in warfighting attrition projections
