To: Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) / U.S. Department of Labor

Request:

Requesting any and all records, reports, internal communications, or investigations regarding Amazon.com, Inc. and its associated warehouses, fulfillment centers, distribution hubs, delivery stations, or third-party logistics providers in connection with employee or contractor injury and death rates, from 2000 to present.

This includes:
	•	OSHA inspection reports, citations, and follow-up documents concerning Amazon-operated fulfillment and distribution facilities
	•	Incident reports of fatalities, severe injuries, or repeat violations at Amazon sites and subcontractor-operated facilities
	•	Analyses or audits comparing Amazon’s injury and fatality rates to industry averages in warehousing, transportation, and logistics
	•	Communications between OSHA, DOL, and Amazon (or subcontractors) concerning injury rate reporting, underreporting, or recordkeeping compliance
	•	Studies or evaluations of how Amazon’s productivity quotas, “time off task” metrics, robotics integration, or reliance on subcontracted/temporary labor correlate with workplace injuries and deaths

Keywords: Amazon, fulfillment center, warehouse, distribution hub, subcontractor, logistics provider, OSHA citation, injury rates, fatality rates, safety compliance, productivity quotas, Department of Labor

To: Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) / U.S. Department of Labor

Request:

Requesting any and all records, reports, internal communications, or investigations regarding Amazon.com, Inc. and its associated warehouses, fulfillment centers, distribution hubs, delivery stations, or third-party logistics providers in connection with employee or contractor injury and death rates, from 2000 to present, with emphasis on how such data is used for predictive modeling of mortality, human performance limits, and workforce survivability.

This includes:
	•	OSHA inspection reports, citations, and fatality investigations involving Amazon-operated fulfillment centers and third-party logistics providers
	•	Analyses or audits correlating Amazon’s injury and death rates with predictive risk models, workforce attrition forecasts, or casualty projections
	•	Communications concerning the use of Amazon occupational safety data in predictive analytics, death-modeling simulations, or behavioral risk modeling frameworks
	•	Documents discussing how Amazon’s reliance on “time off task” surveillance, productivity quotas, robotics, and subcontracted/temporary labor contributes to statistical modeling of human limits, safety failures, and mortality outcomes
	•	Internal or interagency reports evaluating whether Amazon’s occupational safety data has secondary applications in behavioral futures markets, disaster survival prediction, or population-level risk modeling

Keywords: Amazon, fulfillment center, warehouse, distribution hub, subcontractor, logistics provider, OSHA citation, injury rates, fatality rates, mortality modeling, predictive analytics, behavioral futures, productivity quotas

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, research proposals, or internal communications referencing Amazon.com, Inc. or its subsidiaries in connection with logistics, warehouse automation, robotics, or human factors research, from 2000 to present.

This includes:
	•	Contracts or research collaborations involving Amazon warehouses, robotics, or fulfillment centers used as case studies for military logistics or supply chain optimization
	•	Studies of human-robot interaction or operator workload in fulfillment center environments
	•	Internal communications regarding the use of commercial warehousing (Amazon) as a model for military distribution, supply chain resilience, or autonomous system deployment
	•	Reports or proposals analyzing how Amazon’s data on logistics efficiency and workforce management can be leveraged for defense-related applications
