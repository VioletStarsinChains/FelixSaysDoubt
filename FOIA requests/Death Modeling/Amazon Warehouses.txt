Request:

Requesting any and all records, reports, internal communications, or investigations regarding Amazon.com, Inc. and its associated warehouses, fulfillment centers, distribution hubs, delivery stations, or third-party logistics providers in connection with employee or contractor injury and death rates, from 2000 to present, with emphasis on how such data is used for predictive modeling of mortality, human performance limits, and workforce survivability.

This includes:
	•	OSHA inspection reports, citations, and fatality investigations involving Amazon-operated fulfillment centers and third-party logistics providers
	•	Analyses or audits correlating Amazon’s injury and death rates with predictive risk models, workforce attrition forecasts, or casualty projections
	•	Communications concerning the use of Amazon occupational safety data in predictive analytics, death-modeling simulations, or behavioral risk modeling frameworks
	•	Documents discussing how Amazon’s reliance on “time off task” surveillance, productivity quotas, robotics, and subcontracted/temporary labor contributes to statistical modeling of human limits, safety failures, and mortality outcomes
	•	Internal or interagency reports evaluating whether Amazon’s occupational safety data has secondary applications in behavioral futures markets, disaster survival prediction, or population-level risk modeling
