To: Department of Defense / DARPA / BARDA / CIA

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, or contracts related to the testing of synthetic hallucinations in wilderness survival scenarios, from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Internal reports on the deployment of non-physical objects (e.g., boulders, barriers) or figures (e.g., guides, companions) in wilderness conditions
	•	Documentation of subject responses to entrapment, coercion, or abandonment under synthetic sensory conditions
	•	Communications regarding data monetization through behavioral futures markets, particularly relating to survival thresholds and compliance behaviors
	•	Risk analyses concerning long-term psychological impact or fatalities resulting from wilderness-based synthetic hallucination field testing

Keywords: synthetic hallucination, wilderness simulation, entrapment scenario, coercive abandonment, behavioral futures markets, neurotech projection, survival threshold, compliance modeling, DARPA, BARDA

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, research proposals, or internal communications regarding the use of synthetic hallucination technologies to simulate wilderness entrapment scenarios, particularly incidents resembling the Aron Ralston case (2003, Utah) in which an individual amputated his own arm after being trapped by a boulder.

This includes:
	•	Research protocols describing projected or non-physical obstacles used to induce survival decision-making under sensory distortion
	•	Risk–benefit assessments of using synthetic hallucinations to trigger irreversible self-harm or amputation in test subjects
	•	Communications regarding wilderness isolation as an experimental environment for testing compliance under duress
	•	Any behavioral futures market analyses or valuation models derived from individuals’ willingness to self-amputate to avoid death

Keywords: synthetic hallucination, wilderness entrapment, sensory overlay, Aron Ralston, 127 Hours, behavioral futures markets, neurotech projection, survival decision modeling, self-amputation, Blue John Canyon
