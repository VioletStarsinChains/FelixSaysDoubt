Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, research proposals, or internal communications regarding the use of synthetic hallucination technologies to simulate wilderness entrapment scenarios, particularly incidents resembling the Aron Ralston case (2003, Utah) in which an individual amputated his own arm after being trapped by a boulder.

This includes:
	•	Research protocols describing projected or non-physical obstacles used to induce survival decision-making under sensory distortion
	•	Risk–benefit assessments of using synthetic hallucinations to trigger irreversible self-harm or amputation in test subjects
	•	Communications regarding wilderness isolation as an experimental environment for testing compliance under duress
	•	Any behavioral futures market analyses or valuation models derived from individuals’ willingness to self-amputate to avoid death

Keywords: synthetic hallucination, wilderness entrapment, sensory overlay, Aron Ralston, 127 Hours, behavioral futures markets, neurotech projection, survival decision modeling, self-amputation, Blue John Canyon
