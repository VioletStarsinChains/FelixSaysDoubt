To: Department of Defense (DoD) / Department of Justice (DOJ) / Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) / Department of Homeland Security (DHS)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, interagency communications, contractor analyses, or research proposals referencing deaths and disappearances on the Natchez Trace Parkway and their relationship to the presence or operation of physical infrastructure for cognitive entrainment in the surrounding region, from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Analyses treating Parkway incidents as case studies in civilian attrition, compliance under environmental stressors, or induced perceptual distortion
	•	Records linking unexplained fatalities or disappearances to entrainment infrastructure such as transmission arrays, sensory modulation devices, or other neurotechnology installations in proximity to the Parkway
	•	Interagency discussions on the integration of Parkway incident data into combat attrition modeling, behavioral futures markets, or synthetic hallucination testing
	•	Contracts with private vendors, defense contractors, or academic institutions exploring the use of transportation corridors as live compliance laboratories, including embedded entrainment or behavioral influence hardware
	•	Environmental or infrastructure surveys identifying non-standard telecommunications, radar, acoustic, or electromagnetic equipment deployed in or near the Parkway region and associated risk assessments of their potential effects on cognition and behavior

Keywords: Natchez Trace Parkway, disappearances, behavioral futures markets, attrition simulation, compliance anchors, cognitive entrainment, neurotechnology infrastructure, synthetic hallucinations, resilience forecasting, ODNI, DoD

This includes:
	•	Records of experimental or non-standard transmission equipment sited along or adjacent to the Parkway corridor
	•	Spectrum allocation or waiver documents pertaining to research, pilot programs, or contractor deployments in the region
	•	Interagency or contractor reports assessing environmental and human exposure impacts from towers, arrays, or broadcast facilities near the Parkway
	•	Documentation of infrastructure deployments that overlap with periods of unexplained fatalities, disappearances, or major medical emergencies along the Parkway
	•	Communications with DoD, DHS, or other federal agencies regarding dual-use or classified transmission installations in the region

This includes:
	•	Air, water, and soil quality testing results from the park region
	•	Records of electromagnetic field (EMF), microwave, or acoustic exposure surveys
	•	Reports of visitor illness, mass complaints, or adverse health outcomes temporally linked to park visits or events
	•	Permits, site licenses, or interagency communications regarding experimental telecommunications, radar, or other infrastructure in or near Natchez Trace State Park

To: National Park Service (NPS) / Department of the Interior (DOI) / Department of Justice (DOJ)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, incident reports, contractor communications, or interagency assessments concerning the use of role-players, operational avatars, or synthetic social constructs for training, research, or investigative purposes on or in proximity to federal lands, including Natchez Trace Parkway and Natchez Trace State Park, from January 1, 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Records of authorized role-player deployments in law enforcement, intelligence, or training scenarios conducted on park land
	•	Permits or contracts authorizing the use of actors, synthetic personas, or simulated interpersonal encounters for research, testing, or educational programs
	•	Incident reports or visitor complaints referencing encounters later identified as involving contractor role-players or synthetic agents
	•	Communications between NPS, DOI, and DOJ regarding the use of federal recreation areas as testing grounds for behavioral or compliance research
