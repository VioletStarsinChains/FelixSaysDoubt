This includes:
	•	Comparative cognition research involving both human and non-human species in relation to water safety, navigation, or hazard recognition
	•	Behavioral prediction frameworks derived from animal studies for application to human populations in aquatic environments
	•	Simulation-based cognitive ecology or environmental risk assessment models tied to Lake Lanier or other U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reservoirs
	•	Federal or state contracts for cross-species neurobehavioral simulations in environmental safety training
	•	Ethical review board (IRB/IACUC) filings for human-animal cognitive modeling projects related to environmental hazards
	•	Collaboration records with USACE, CDC, or Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR)
	•	Grants or memoranda of understanding with defense or intelligence agencies for aquatic behavioral research
