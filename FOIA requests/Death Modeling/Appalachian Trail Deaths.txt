FOIA – Mortality & Safety on the Appalachian Trail

To: National Park Service (NPS) / U.S. Forest Service (USFS) / Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, reports, incident logs, interagency communications, and contracts from 1990 to present concerning deaths, disappearances, injuries, and medical emergencies along the Appalachian Trail and its feeder trails.

This includes:
	•	Annual or cumulative mortality reports related to exposure, falls, cardiac events, illness, or unexplained causes on the trail system
	•	Search-and-rescue incident logs and after-action reports
	•	Communications regarding safety hazards, infrastructure improvements, or attrition risk assessments
	•	Research collaborations with universities or contractors studying health, safety, or demographic patterns of trail users
	•	Comparisons of mortality rates on the Appalachian Trail to other federally managed recreation areas

Keywords: Appalachian Trail, trail deaths, trail disappearances, search and rescue, medical emergencies, exposure fatalities, NPS, USFS, CDC

FOIA (Spicy Angle – Behavioral Futures Markets & Trail Mortality)

To: Department of Defense (DoD – DARPA, USAMRDC) / Department of Homeland Security (DHS – S&T) / Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, contracts, pilots, reports, or internal analyses from 1990 to present concerning the use of the Appalachian Trail and associated trail systems as behavioral modeling environments tied to risk forecasting or behavioral futures markets.

This includes:
	•	Records describing trail-based exposure to risk (injury, illness, disappearance, death) as input for behavioral prediction models
	•	Analyses of unsafe or under-regulated trail conditions as deliberate variables for studying decision-making, compliance, or survival outcomes
	•	Contracts with private entities or academic groups exploring trail environments as natural laboratories for behavioral economics or predictive analytics
	•	Reports on financial instruments, simulations, or market models linked to trail attrition or population-level risk scenarios
	•	Ethical reviews or risk assessments regarding intentional exposure of trail populations to hazardous conditions for predictive or market purposes

Keywords: behavioral futures, risk modeling, Appalachian Trail, disappearances, DARPA, IARPA, DHS, mortality forecasting, predictive analytics
