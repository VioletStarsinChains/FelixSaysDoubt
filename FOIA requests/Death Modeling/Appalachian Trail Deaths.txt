To: National Park Service (NPS) / U.S. Forest Service (USFS) / Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, reports, incident logs, interagency communications, and contracts from 1990 to present concerning deaths, disappearances, injuries, and medical emergencies along the Appalachian Trail and its feeder trails.

This includes:
	•	Annual or cumulative mortality reports related to exposure, falls, cardiac events, illness, or unexplained causes on the trail system
	•	Search-and-rescue incident logs and after-action reports
	•	Communications regarding safety hazards, infrastructure improvements, or attrition risk assessments
	•	Research collaborations with universities or contractors studying health, safety, or demographic patterns of trail users

FOIA (Spicy Angle – Behavioral Futures Markets & Trail Mortality)

To: Department of Defense (DoD – DARPA, USAMRDC) / Department of Homeland Security (DHS – S&T) / Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, contracts, pilots, reports, or internal analyses from 1990 to present concerning the use of the Appalachian Trail and associated trail systems as behavioral modeling environments tied to risk forecasting or behavioral futures markets.

This includes:
	•	Records describing trail-based exposure to risk (injury, illness, disappearance, death) as input for behavioral prediction models
	•	Analyses of unsafe or under-regulated trail conditions as deliberate variables for studying decision-making, compliance, or survival outcomes
	•	Contracts with private entities or academic groups exploring trail environments as natural laboratories for behavioral economics or predictive analytics
	•	Reports on financial instruments, simulations, or market models linked to trail attrition or population-level risk scenarios
	•	Ethical reviews or risk assessments regarding intentional exposure of trail populations to hazardous conditions for predictive or market purposes

Keywords: behavioral futures, risk modeling, Appalachian Trail, disappearances, DARPA, IARPA, DHS, mortality forecasting, predictive analytics

To: Department of Health and Human Services (HHS – CMS) / Department of the Treasury / Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) / Federal Insurance Office (FIO)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, contracts, memoranda of understanding, reports, and interagency communications from 1990 to present concerning partnerships between federal agencies and private insurance or reinsurance firms related to mortality, injury, or disappearance data from the Appalachian Trail and associated trail systems.

This includes:
	•	Records of insurance industry access to mortality, medical emergency, or disappearance data on federally managed trails
	•	Communications regarding the use of trail incident data for underwriting, actuarial models, or risk-pricing
	•	Reports or contracts involving reinsurance firms, hedge funds, or financial market actors using trail mortality/disappearance data in predictive models
	•	Analyses of whether mortality/disappearance events in high-risk outdoor recreation environments are used as inputs for behavioral futures markets or related financial instruments
