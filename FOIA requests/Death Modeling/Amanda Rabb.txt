To Department of Defense / DARPA / Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) / Department of Homeland Security / Federal Bureau of Investigation

Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, contracts, internal communications, or technical evaluations from January 1, 2005 to present concerning the deployment of dual-track behavioral simulations in which subjects interact with one stimulus in the physical environment while parallel simulations of observers are shown a different stimulus.

This includes:
	•	Experimental designs where simulation cohorts perceive altered versions of flyers, signage, or public communications than what was physically distributed
	•	Studies on the use of augmented reality or perceptual overlays to present divergent realities to physical participants versus modeled participants
	•	Records of field trials involving homeless or addicted populations in which synthetic “copies” of individuals were run across multiple locations or contexts simultaneously
	•	Internal discussions of “attrition simulations” or “narrative stress tests” where the simulated version of a subject engages in behaviors not enacted by the physical individual
	•	Reports or vendor deliverables on the integration of such dual-track overlays into predictive policing, counter-extremism, or urban behavioral modeling programs

Keywords: dual-track simulation, synthetic overlays, divergent stimuli, AR perception testing, narrative stress test, attrition simulation, simulated observers, behavioral futures, augmented reality, IARPA, DARPA, DHS

To Federal Trade Commission (FTC) / Federal Communications Commission (FCC) / Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)

Request:

Requesting any and all consumer complaints, regulatory filings, research proposals, or enforcement actions from January 1, 2005 to present regarding the use of dual-track or split-stimuli environments in which consumers are physically shown one piece of media while simulated or test audiences are shown a different version.

This includes:
	•	Records on advertising or marketing pilots where consumers and simulated focus-groups were presented with divergent messaging for comparison purposes
	•	Investigations into the use of augmented reality or perceptual overlays to alter consumer perception of signage, product labeling, or flyers
	•	Studies or internal analyses on the risks of misleading advertising or unfair/deceptive practices when test populations and real consumers receive different versions of the same content
	•	Vendor contracts or demonstration projects involving “synthetic audience overlays” or “dual-track messaging” for behavioral modeling
	•	Reports on consumer harm, confusion, or market distortion resulting from such practices

Keywords: dual-track messaging, divergent stimuli, synthetic audience, AR overlays, consumer deception, behavioral modeling, simulated focus groups, FTC compliance, false advertising, perceptual testing

To Department of Defense / DARPA / U.S. Navy / Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate (JNLWD)

Request:

Requesting any and all technical reports, research proposals, internal communications, or vendor contracts from January 1, 1990 to present concerning the use of cavitation phenomena as a mechanism for incapacitation or lethality in human or animal subjects.

This includes:
	•	Studies on cavitation induced by ultrasound, infrasound, directed energy, or electromagnetic methods
	•	Evaluations of cavitation as a non-lethal deterrent versus as a potential kill mechanism
	•	Safety assessments, risk-benefit analyses, or medical reviews of cavitation effects on brain, lung, or vascular tissues
	•	Interagency communications or briefings on the potential for cavitation to be used in crowd control, counterinsurgency, or covert operations
	•	Contracts or research partnerships with private sector vendors exploring cavitation for defense, intelligence, or law enforcement applications

Keywords: cavitation weapons, ultrasonic cavitation, infrasound lethality, directed energy cavitation, acoustic weapons, JNLWD, DARPA, non-lethal deterrent, crowd control, covert incapacitation

To National Institutes of Health (NIH) / Food and Drug Administration (FDA) / National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)

Request:

Requesting any and all studies, internal communications, grant proposals, or regulatory evaluations from January 1, 1990 to present concerning the effects of cavitation phenomena on human or animal health.

This includes:
	•	Research on ultrasound- or infrasound-induced cavitation and its potential for tissue damage in medical or consumer contexts
	•	Safety assessments of cavitation in diagnostic ultrasound, lithotripsy, or other therapeutic devices
	•	Reports of adverse events or complications linked to cavitation in FDA-regulated medical products
	•	NIST or interagency evaluations of cavitation as an occupational or environmental hazard (e.g. industrial ultrasound, sonar, or energy systems)
	•	Communications regarding standards development, measurement techniques, or exposure thresholds for cavitation effects on biological tissues

Keywords: cavitation effects, ultrasound safety, infrasound exposure, lithotripsy risks, acoustic cavitation, FDA adverse events, NIST standards, NIH medical research, consumer protection, non-ionizing energy safety
