Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, contracts, internal communications, or technical evaluations from January 1, 2005 to present concerning the deployment of dual-track behavioral simulations in which subjects interact with one stimulus in the physical environment while parallel simulations of observers are shown a different stimulus.

This includes:

	•	Studies on the use of augmented reality or perceptual overlays to present divergent realities to physical participants versus modeled participants
	•	Records of field trials involving homeless or addicted populations in which synthetic “copies” of individuals were run across multiple locations or contexts simultaneously
	•	Internal discussions of “attrition simulations” or “narrative stress tests” where the simulated version of a subject engages in behaviors not enacted by the physical individual
	•	Reports or vendor deliverables on the integration of such dual-track overlays into predictive policing, counter-extremism, or urban behavioral modeling programs
