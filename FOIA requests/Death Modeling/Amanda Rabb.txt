To Department of Defense / DARPA / Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) / Department of Homeland Security / Federal Bureau of Investigation

Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, contracts, internal communications, or technical evaluations from January 1, 2005 to present concerning the deployment of dual-track behavioral simulations in which subjects interact with one stimulus in the physical environment while parallel simulations of observers are shown a different stimulus.

This includes:
	•	Experimental designs where simulation cohorts perceive altered versions of flyers, signage, or public communications than what was physically distributed
	•	Studies on the use of augmented reality or perceptual overlays to present divergent realities to physical participants versus modeled participants
	•	Records of field trials involving homeless or addicted populations in which synthetic “copies” of individuals were run across multiple locations or contexts simultaneously
	•	Internal discussions of “attrition simulations” or “narrative stress tests” where the simulated version of a subject engages in behaviors not enacted by the physical individual
	•	Reports or vendor deliverables on the integration of such dual-track overlays into predictive policing, counter-extremism, or urban behavioral modeling programs

Keywords: dual-track simulation, synthetic overlays, divergent stimuli, AR perception testing, narrative stress test, attrition simulation, simulated observers, behavioral futures, augmented reality, IARPA, DARPA, DHS

To Federal Trade Commission (FTC) / Federal Communications Commission (FCC) / Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)

Request:

Requesting any and all consumer complaints, regulatory filings, research proposals, or enforcement actions from January 1, 2005 to present regarding the use of dual-track or split-stimuli environments in which consumers are physically shown one piece of media while simulated or test audiences are shown a different version.

This includes:
	•	Records on advertising or marketing pilots where consumers and simulated focus-groups were presented with divergent messaging for comparison purposes
	•	Investigations into the use of augmented reality or perceptual overlays to alter consumer perception of signage, product labeling, or flyers
	•	Studies or internal analyses on the risks of misleading advertising or unfair/deceptive practices when test populations and real consumers receive different versions of the same content
	•	Vendor contracts or demonstration projects involving “synthetic audience overlays” or “dual-track messaging” for behavioral modeling
	•	Reports on consumer harm, confusion, or market distortion resulting from such practices

Keywords: dual-track messaging, divergent stimuli, synthetic audience, AR overlays, consumer deception, behavioral modeling, simulated focus groups, FTC compliance, false advertising, perceptual testing
