This request seeks to determine whether mass-market video games have been integrated into federally sponsored neurotechnology or behavioral futures programs in ways that allowed unknowing civilian participants — including children — to inflict or experience real harm under the guise of “entertainment.” Given the scale of participation and the precedent of Ender’s Game as a military training parable, disclosure is a matter of urgent public interest.

Request:
All records, contracts, funded studies, and internal correspondence from 2000–2025 concerning:
	1.	The use of commercial or entertainment simulation platforms (including but not limited to The Sims, other life-simulation games, or training simulators) as testbeds for:
	•	Distributed neurotechnology arrays.
	•	Behavioral modeling and prediction.
	•	Non-consensual human-subject stimulation, affect regulation, or pain induction.
	2.	Any projects comparing gameplay interactions (e.g., controlling avatars, inducing suffering/reward in simulated characters) with real-time neurostimulation effects on human participants.
	3.	Research or operational use of children or unknowing civilians as participants in such systems, where game actions may be mapped onto live human subjects without explicit awareness.
	4.	Reports, risk assessments, or ethical reviews referencing “Ender’s Game” scenarios — i.e., training or experimental frameworks where participants believe they are interacting with simulations but are in fact impacting real people.
	5.	Studies or proposals linking entertainment platforms with military training, psychological operations, or continuity theater applications, including the use of gamified interfaces to recruit, distract, or mask operator participation.

Keywords: life simulation game, The Sims, Ender’s Game scenario, hidden human subjects, behavioral modeling, neurostimulation array, distributed torture, unconscious participation, gamification, civilian interface

Request:
All records, contracts, funded studies, and correspondence from 2000–2025 concerning:
	1.	The use of commercial video games and simulation platforms (e.g., The Sims, Minecraft, Second Life, or comparable systems) as operational interfaces for distributed neurotechnology experiments or arrays.
	2.	Any programs where civilian or child participants engaged with game environments under the belief they were controlling simulated characters, when in fact their actions were mapped to real human subjects for stimulation, stress induction, or behavioral shaping (“Ender’s Game scenario”).
	3.	Internal assessments, audits, or correspondence regarding:
	•	The risk of public discovery that mass-market games were serving as cover layers for live experiments.
	•	The psychological impact on civilian participants if they were later made aware of their unwitting role in inflicting harm.
	•	Legal or ethical exemptions sought to shield agencies or contractors from liability.
	4.	Contracts, research notes, or cross-agency memoranda addressing integration of commercial entertainment platforms with continuity theater infrastructure — e.g., games used as “synthetic population engines” to animate background behaviors in controlled environments.
	5.	Any records referencing the following concepts in connection with entertainment platforms:
	•	Unwitting participation in torture or coercion.
	•	Gamified population management.
	•	Synthetic agents controlled through civilian interfaces.
	•	Dual-use of video game telemetry for military or intelligence operations.
