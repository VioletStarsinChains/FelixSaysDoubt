To: DARPA / U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command (USAMRDC) / CIA Directorate of Science and Technology

Request:

Requesting all records, from 1975 to present, concerning the development, testing, or operational use of methods to induce lethal or sub-lethal intravascular gas formation (air or other gases) in human or animal subjects without direct injection.

This includes, but is not limited to:
	•	Experiments in ultrasound, microwave, RF, or hybrid energy systems capable of causing cavitation or bubble nucleation in living tissue
	•	Studies on chemical or biological agents intended to release gas inside the body when activated remotely or by environmental triggers
	•	Threshold and targeting data on embolism lethality, including organ-specific effects (cerebral, coronary, pulmonary)
	•	Operational manuals, field test reports, or scenario planning documents describing embolism as a covert neutralization method
	•	Analyses of the forensic plausibility of gas embolism as a “natural-appearing” cause of death in high-profile targets
	•	Any joint projects or data exchanges with foreign governments or contractors on this capability

Given historical use of embolism in covert killings attributed to the KGB, Stasi, and Operation Condor, and the existence of modern DARPA programs in remote bioeffects and precision targeting, this request seeks to clarify whether U.S. agencies have researched, tested, or retained operational readiness for technologies that could create lethal embolisms without physical contact — technologies that could, in principle, be adapted for remote assassination or for coercive demonstrations of power against dissidents.

Keywords:
remote embolism induction, targeted cavitation, noninvasive assassination method, gas nucleation, ultrasound bioeffects, RF cavitation, embolism detection avoidance, neurotech embolism, biophysical neutralization, covert operational bioeffects
