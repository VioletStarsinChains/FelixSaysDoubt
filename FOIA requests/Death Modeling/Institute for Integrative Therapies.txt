Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, research proposals, internal communications, or regulatory filings from 2010 to present regarding the Minnesota-based Institute for Integrative Therapies (IIT), particularly in connection with psychedelic therapy, terminally ill patient populations, and behavioral or mortality modeling.

This includes:
	•	Research proposals, grant applications, or contracts between IIT and federal agencies involving psychedelic-assisted therapy for terminally ill patients
	•	Documents referencing the use of IIT or its affiliated entities (including Ellie Family Services/Ellie Mental Health) as clinical data sources for mortality prediction, end-of-life behavioral modeling, or “death modeling” frameworks
	•	Internal communications or regulatory filings regarding IIT’s recruitment and treatment of terminally ill patients for psychedelic therapy studies
	•	Records of any involvement with patents, pilot programs, or research projects related to covert sensor injection or covert biometric monitoring in therapeutic contexts
	•	Contracts or collaborations between IIT and defense, intelligence, or private contractors (e.g., Palantir, DARPA, BARDA) focused on neurotechnology, surveillance, or predictive analytics
	•	Ethics reviews, adverse event reports, or risk assessments concerning IIT’s psychedelic therapy trials, particularly related to vulnerable/terminally ill populations
	•	Communications addressing data-sharing agreements, commercialization, or use of IIT patient data for behavioral futures markets, surveillance applications, or AI training
