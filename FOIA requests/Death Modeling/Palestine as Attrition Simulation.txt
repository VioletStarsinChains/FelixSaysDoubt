To Department of Defense (DoD) / Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) / Department of State / U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, communications, research studies, contractor reports, or interagency assessments from 2000 to present comparing the Gaza Strip and the West Bank as distinct environments for civilian risk assessment, resilience analysis, and behavioral modeling.

This includes:
	•	Analyses that treat Gaza and the West Bank as comparative datasets (e.g., blockade/siege vs. restricted movement/permit regimes) for modeling population behavior under varying control conditions
	•	Reports, war-game outputs, or policy memos contrasting collapse dynamics, compliance, mobility, access to essentials, and social network robustness between the two regions
	•	Contractor or academic deliverables evaluating infrastructure disruption, scarcity events, and aid logistics as behavioral inputs in each area
	•	Interagency communications (DoD, CIA, State, USAID) regarding the methodological use of Gaza/West Bank contrast in forecasting civilian outcomes, humanitarian needs, or conflict escalation risks
	•	Documentation referencing data-sharing with allied governments or third-party vendors on comparative civilian telemetry from Gaza and the West Bank

Keywords: Gaza, West Bank, comparative dataset, civilian resilience, risk assessment, behavioral modeling, collapse dynamics, mobility restrictions, aid logistics, interagency assessments

To Department of Defense (DoD) / Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) / Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) / Department of State

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, communications, research studies, contractor reports, or interagency assessments from 2000 to present concerning the deliberate use of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank as paired environments in behavioral futures markets, including treatment of Gaza as a higher-intensity containment rig and the West Bank as a comparative control for compliance and attrition modeling.

This includes:
	•	Records acknowledging Gaza/West Bank as a dual-condition experimental frame (blockade/siege vs. occupation/permitting) for testing compliance anchors, scarcity tolerance, and crowd attrition
	•	Documentation of contracts or projects with defense contractors, academic partners, or allied entities that monetize civilian telemetry from each region as predictive inputs to risk models or markets
	•	Reports comparing information operations, narrative trap uptake, and infrastructure sabotage effects across the two regions for calibration of population management strategies
	•	Interagency discussions of model transferability (e.g., how Gaza-derived attrition metrics are validated or adjusted using West Bank data as a control condition)
	•	Risk-benefit or ethics analyses addressing the conversion of paired civilian datasets (Gaza vs. West Bank) into tradable behavioral futures or decision-support tools

Keywords: Gaza containment rig, West Bank control condition, behavioral futures markets, compliance anchors, attrition calibration, telemetry monetization, population management, ODNI, DoD, CIA, State
