Request:

Requesting any and all documents, communications, research studies, contractor reports, or interagency assessments from 2000 to present comparing the Gaza Strip and the West Bank as distinct environments for civilian risk assessment, resilience analysis, and behavioral modeling.

This includes:
	•	Analyses that treat Gaza and the West Bank as comparative datasets (e.g., blockade/siege vs. restricted movement/permit regimes) for modeling population behavior under varying control conditions
	•	Reports, war-game outputs, or policy memos contrasting collapse dynamics, compliance, mobility, access to essentials, and social network robustness between the two regions
	•	Contractor or academic deliverables evaluating infrastructure disruption, scarcity events, and aid logistics as behavioral inputs in each area
	•	Interagency communications (DoD, CIA, State, USAID) regarding the methodological use of Gaza/West Bank contrast in forecasting civilian outcomes, humanitarian needs, or conflict escalation risks
	•	Documentation referencing data-sharing with allied governments or third-party vendors on comparative civilian telemetry from Gaza and the West Bank

Keywords: Gaza, West Bank, comparative dataset, civilian resilience, risk assessment, behavioral modeling, collapse dynamics, mobility restrictions, aid logistics, interagency assessments

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, communications, research studies, contractor reports, or interagency assessments from 2000 to present concerning the deliberate use of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank as paired environments in behavioral futures markets, including treatment of Gaza as a higher-intensity containment rig and the West Bank as a comparative control for compliance and attrition modeling.

This includes:
	•	Records acknowledging Gaza/West Bank as a dual-condition experimental frame (blockade/siege vs. occupation/permitting) for testing compliance anchors, scarcity tolerance, and crowd attrition
	•	Documentation of contracts or projects with defense contractors, academic partners, or allied entities that monetize civilian telemetry from each region as predictive inputs to risk models or markets
	•	Reports comparing information operations, narrative trap uptake, and infrastructure sabotage effects across the two regions for calibration of population management strategies
	•	Interagency discussions of model transferability (e.g., how Gaza-derived attrition metrics are validated or adjusted using West Bank data as a control condition)
	•	Risk-benefit or ethics analyses addressing the conversion of paired civilian datasets (Gaza vs. West Bank) into tradable behavioral futures or decision-support tools

Keywords: Gaza containment rig, West Bank control condition, behavioral futures markets, compliance anchors, attrition calibration, telemetry monetization, population management, ODNI, DoD, CIA, State

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, communications, research studies, contractor reports, or interagency assessments from 2000 to present concerning the use of mortality data from Gaza and the West Bank as inputs to death modeling frameworks for behavioral futures markets and predictive warfare economics.

This includes:
	•	Records treating Gaza as a high-intensity death dataset (mass casualties, siege conditions, bombardment) and the West Bank as a comparative low-intensity dataset (targeted killings, medical access restrictions, mobility attrition) for mortality modeling
	•	Documentation of death rate telemetry harvested for use in risk markets, including projections of how different attrition curves (rapid vs. slow mortality) influence population compliance or collapse trajectories
	•	Reports analyzing the economic valuation of civilian death data, including conversion into predictive indices for military, financial, or corporate decision-making
	•	Interagency communications referencing Gaza/West Bank mortality figures as experimental contrasts to calibrate death modeling algorithms for other geopolitical theaters (e.g., Iraq, Afghanistan, Ukraine)
	•	Contracts or academic partnerships explicitly linking civilian deaths to behavioral futures market pricing or predictive modeling tools for conflict outcomes

Keywords: Gaza death modeling, West Bank mortality dataset, attrition mortality telemetry, behavioral futures markets, predictive warfare economics, civilian death commodification, mortality curve calibration, ODNI, DoD, CIA, State

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, communications, research studies, contractor reports, or interagency assessments from 2000 to present concerning the use of child mortality data in Gaza and the West Bank as predictive inputs for death modeling, attrition simulations, and behavioral futures markets.

This includes:
	•	Records referencing child mortality rates as early indicators of system collapse, compliance thresholds, or attrition endurance in civilian populations under blockade, siege, or occupation
	•	Documentation of models that treat pediatric deaths as sensitive metrics for forecasting broader population destabilization, displacement patterns, or aid dependence
	•	Reports analyzing the marketization of child death data—including its conversion into risk indices for defense, intelligence, or financial applications
	•	Communications between DoD, CIA, ODNI, State, and USAID on the comparative utility of Gaza vs. West Bank child mortality data for calibration of predictive analytics and transfer to other conflict theaters
	•	Contractor or academic projects explicitly referencing child mortality telemetry as a high-value variable in attrition simulations, siege modeling, or predictive warfare economics

Keywords: Gaza child mortality, West Bank pediatric deaths, attrition simulations, collapse forecasting, behavioral futures markets, predictive warfare, child mortality telemetry, civilian compliance thresholds, siege modeling
