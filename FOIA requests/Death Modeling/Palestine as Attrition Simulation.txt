To Department of Defense (DoD) / Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) / Department of State

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, communications, research studies, or contractor reports from 2000 to present regarding the use of the Gaza Strip as a live attrition combat simulation or behavioral futures modeling environment.

This includes:
	•	Internal analyses on how civilian populations under blockade, bombardment, or chronic scarcity are modeled as part of risk assessment for combat attrition scenarios
	•	Documentation referencing the use of Gaza as a data source for predictive modeling of population collapse, resilience, or compliance under prolonged siege conditions
	•	Communications between DoD, CIA, and State Department officials regarding Gaza as a “testbed” for crowd behavior, infrastructure collapse, or humanitarian breakdown, and how such data informs military or commercial simulations
	•	Reports on the role of third-party defense contractors, academic institutions, or allied governments in harvesting behavioral telemetry from Gaza for use in attrition modeling and behavioral futures markets
	•	Risk assessment documents or war-gaming outputs explicitly linking civilian attrition in Gaza to broader global predictive modeling initiatives

Keywords: Gaza attrition simulation, civilian behavioral modeling, siege data, population collapse telemetry, behavioral futures, combat risk assessment, infrastructure collapse modeling, predictive warfare experiments

To Department of Defense (DoD) / Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) / Department of State

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, communications, research studies, or contractor reports from 2000 to present regarding the deliberate use of the Gaza Strip as a containment rig for behavioral futures markets, designed to generate and monetize predictive data on civilian attrition.

This includes:
	•	Records acknowledging Gaza as an engineered environment for testing how prolonged siege, deprivation, and bombardment can entrain populations into predictable behavioral patterns
	•	Documentation of contracts or projects involving U.S. defense contractors, academic partners, or allied governments treating Gaza as a live behavioral telemetry collection zone for risk assessment markets
	•	Reports analyzing the conversion of Gaza civilian data into tradable behavioral futures, including how scarcity-induced compliance or collapse metrics are quantified for strategic and financial purposes
	•	Interagency communications referencing Gaza as a “living laboratory” or “testbed” for synthetic crisis modeling, crowd attrition calibration, or infrastructure collapse prediction
	•	Risk-benefit analyses comparing Gaza to other conflict zones (Iraq, Afghanistan, Ukraine) in terms of the quality and reliability of behavioral futures data derived from attrition conditions

Keywords: Gaza containment rig, behavioral futures market, synthetic crisis modeling, attrition telemetry, population collapse commodification, siege data monetization, compliance entrainment, predictive warfare economics
