To: Department of Transportation / National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) / Federal Trade Commission (FTC)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, internal communications, contractor deliverables, or incident reports regarding the installation of entrainment, surveillance, or experimental devices in vehicles inspected or serviced through facilities contracted by or affiliated with rideshare companies (Uber, Lyft) from 2010 to present.

This includes:
	•	Records of vehicle inspection protocols for Uber and Lyft vehicles, particularly where third-party shops or certified mechanics are involved.
	•	Communications regarding potential aftermarket installations during inspection or service (tracking devices, sensors, behavioral monitoring hardware).
	•	Any documents on covert neurotech or chemical delivery devices integrated into HVAC systems, seating, or cabin surfaces.
	•	Contracts or audits involving rideshare companies and vehicle service networks referencing safety, surveillance, or “compliance assurance” technologies.
	•	Risk assessments or ethical reviews concerning the possibility of entrainment devices being deployed via inspection or repair shops.
	•	Consumer complaints or whistleblower reports alleging manipulation, unauthorized monitoring, or unexplained health/behavioral effects following vehicle inspection.

To: Department of Homeland Security (DHS) / Transportation Security Administration (TSA) / Science & Technology Directorate

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, pilot programs, research proposals, internal communications, or contractor deliverables concerning the installation of entrainment, surveillance, or experimental devices in vehicles used for rideshare services (Uber, Lyft) from 2010 to present, particularly when such installations may have been justified under counterterrorism, transportation security, or behavioral monitoring initiatives.

This includes:
	•	Studies or programs involving rideshare vehicle cabins as test environments for passenger behavior tracking or modulation.
	•	Records describing integration of devices into HVAC systems, seating, dashboards, or in-cabin surfaces for covert delivery of chemical, acoustic, or electromagnetic interventions.
	•	Contracts with inspection shops, certified mechanics, or fleet management contractors involving aftermarket installations under DHS/TSA authority.
	•	Communications between DHS, TSA, or affiliated contractors and rideshare companies (Uber, Lyft) regarding passenger safety, “anomaly detection,” or compliance systems.
	•	Risk assessments, ethical reviews, or whistleblower reports concerning the potential misuse of inspection/repair processes to install entrainment devices.
	•	Any evidence of federal grants or S&T projects testing “behavioral futures” or entrainment technologies in rideshare contexts.
