To Department of Transportation / Federal Transit Administration (FTA) / Department of Energy (DOE) / Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) / Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) / National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)

Request:

Requesting any and all contracts, grants, pilot project reports, interagency communications, or internal analyses from January 1, 2020 to present concerning the use of federal COVID-era relief funds (CARES Act, CRRSAA, ARPA) to support micromobility companies (e.g., Bird, Lime, Spin, Jump/Uber, Lyft Bikes, or equivalent shared scooter/bike providers) in U.S. cities.

This includes:
	•	Grant applications, awards, and statements of work describing micromobility as an essential transportation service during the COVID-19 pandemic
	•	Deliverables, datasets, or dashboards referencing injury tracking, crash data, or emergency department presentations linked to shared scooter/bike use
	•	Interagency or contractor communications describing micromobility programs as part of “resilience,” “compliance,” or “first/last mile behavioral modeling” during periods of reduced transit service
	•	Reports evaluating the role of scooter/bike data streams in population-level mobility analytics under COVID restrictions
	•	Risk-benefit assessments or safety audits specifically connecting COVID relief-funded micromobility to injury modeling, compliance anchors, or predictive futures analyses
	•	Correspondence between FTA, DOT, DOE, or HHS/CDC regarding the framing of micromobility injuries as an acceptable trade-off for mobility access or data capture during the pandemic

Keywords: micromobility, scooters, bikeshare, COVID relief, CARES Act, CRRSAA, ARPA, injury modeling, compliance testing, resilience metrics, behavioral futures, essential transportation, NHTSA crash data
