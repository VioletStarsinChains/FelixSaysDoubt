FOIA (Spicy Angle – Bicycle Recycling as Continuity Theater & Attrition Metal Recovery)

To: Department of Defense (DoD – DARPA, USAMRDC) / Department of Homeland Security (DHS – S&T) / Department of Energy (DOE – Critical Materials Institute)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, contracts, pilots, reports, or internal analyses from 1990 to present concerning the role of bicycle repair and recycling programs in continuity theater or attrition metal recovery operations.

This includes:
	•	Records describing abandoned or surplus bicycles as continuity risks in urban environments following population decline or attrition events
	•	Reports on bicycle collection programs as material sinks for recovering aluminum, steel, titanium, copper, or rare earths for supply-constrained industries
	•	Analyses of “community bike recycling” as dual-purpose infrastructure: continuity theater (appearance of thriving urban cycling culture) and strategic material reclamation
	•	Contracts or communications involving defense or homeland security agencies regarding bicycles as vectors for continuity staging or material recovery
	•	Risk/benefit assessments of concealing attrition-related bicycle reclamation within public sustainability initiatives

Keywords: continuity theater, attrition recovery, bicycle recycling, aluminum shortage, titanium recovery, DHS, DARPA, DOE
