FOIA – Micro-Mobility & Motorcycle Tech Pilots

To: Department of Transportation (DOT – Federal Highway Administration, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) / National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, contracts, research projects, or interagency communications from 2000 to present concerning the use of motorcycles or motor-scooters in federal pilots for urban mobility studies, traffic flow modeling, or noise/vibration exposure research.

This includes:
	•	Contracts with vendors for “smart motorcycles” or connected motorcycle research
	•	Reports on noise, vibration, or EMF emissions from motorcycles in urban settings
	•	Analyses of motorcycles as mobile data-collection platforms in transportation studies
	•	Communications with manufacturers regarding sensor-enabled motorcycles

Keywords: smart motorcycle, connected vehicle, mobility study, traffic modeling, NIST, DOT, NHTSA

FOIA (Spicy Angle – Motorcycles as Cloaked Drone Nodes in Continuity Theater)

To: Department of Defense (DoD – DARPA, USAMRDC) / Department of Homeland Security (DHS – S&T, CISA) / Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, pilots, contracts, reports, or internal analyses from 2000 to present concerning the use of drone platforms cloaked or perceptionally masked as motorcycles for continuity-theater or entrainment-network purposes.

This includes:
	•	Records describing unmanned aerial or ground systems disguised as motorcycles for deployment in public environments
	•	Reports on the use of motorcycle-cloaked drones as entrainment anchors, continuity props, or behavioral modeling devices
	•	Analyses of noise/vibration generators embedded in synthetic motorcycles for crowd conditioning or environmental continuity
	•	Communications with defense contractors or research labs developing perception-masking systems for drones disguised as consumer vehicles
	•	Risk/benefit assessments of maintaining motorcycle continuity through synthetic drone deployment following population attrition

Keywords: cloaked drone, motorcycle prop, continuity theater, entrainment network, DARPA, DHS, IARPA
