Subject: FOIA Request – Compostable Food Service Products and Soil Contamination Studies (Starbucks and Comparable Chains)

To:
	•	U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) – Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery; Office of Research and Development
	•	U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) – Agricultural Research Service; National Institute of Food and Agriculture
	•	Food and Drug Administration (FDA) – Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition; Office of Food Additive Safety
	•	Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) – National Center for Environmental Health
	•	State Departments of Agriculture and Environmental Quality (focus on states with Starbucks compost programs, e.g., Washington, California, Minnesota, Oregon, New York)

Request:
Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, I request access to all records, reports, studies, laboratory analyses, internal communications, and correspondence from January 1, 2015 to the present concerning the potential soil, plant, or groundwater contamination resulting from the composting of paper-based and plant-based “compostable” food service products from Starbucks and other large coffee chains. This request specifically includes but is not limited to:
	1.	PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) in compost derived from coated paper cups, sleeves, or packaging.
	2.	Formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasing resins in compostable packaging waste.
	3.	Chlorinated compounds (including dioxins and chlorinated phenols) from bleached napkins, stir sticks, and cup liners.
	4.	Microplastics and bioplastic residues (including PLA) from compostable cup linings and stir stick coatings.
	5.	Heavy metals in inks, dyes, and pigments on composted packaging.
	6.	Bisphenols (BPA, BPS) from thermal paper receipts or packaging included in compost streams.
	7.	Phenolic coatings or treatments on stir sticks or packaging and their persistence in compost-amended soils.
	8.	Acrylamide presence in compost streams from heat-treated plant-based packaging.

Additional Scope:
	•	Any studies or assessments on the effects of these contaminants on soil microbial health, crop uptake, and long-term soil chemistry.
	•	Any assessments, incident reports, or internal discussions on large-scale food service waste streams acting as a vector for environmental contaminant distribution via compost.
	•	Any laboratory testing data or field study results specific to Starbucks or other named major coffee chains’ compostable product lines.

I request that all responsive records be provided in electronic format.
