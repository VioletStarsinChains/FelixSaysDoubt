FOIA Request:
I am requesting any and all records, reports, internal communications, research documents, or environmental assessments related to the impact of phytic acid–rich organic waste streams (including but not limited to coffee grounds, nut shells, grain byproducts, and plant-based packaging) on soil mineral bioavailability when incorporated into municipal or commercial composting programs.

Please include materials addressing:
	•	Phytic acid content in compost inputs from large-scale food and beverage businesses (e.g., coffee chains, plant-based packaging manufacturers)
	•	The role of phytic acid in binding or chelating minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, manganese, or copper in compost or soils
	•	Rates of phytate breakdown under varying composting conditions (e.g., aerobic vs. anaerobic, thermophilic vs. mesophilic)
	•	Potential for phytic acid to cause temporary or prolonged micronutrient deficiencies in soils or crops
	•	Any environmental monitoring or agricultural studies related to corporate compost programs, especially those involving Starbucks or other coffee companies, in which coffee grounds or phytic acid–rich waste were a major input

Date range: 1990–present.

Preferred format: Electronic, searchable PDFs.
