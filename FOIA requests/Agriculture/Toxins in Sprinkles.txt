To: United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) / Food and Drug Administration (FDA) / Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, laboratory analyses, environmental assessments, contracts, communications, or investigative files from January 1, 2000 to present concerning acrylamide, 4-MEI, or other Maillard reaction byproducts in edible sprinkle products (including chocolate sprinkles, cocoa-based sprinkles, caramel-colored sprinkles, and artificially dyed decorative confectionery), with particular attention to sprinkles incorporated into baked goods or other heated products.

This includes:
	•	Laboratory testing of acrylamide, 4-MEI, and furan content in various sprinkle formulations before and after secondary baking or roasting within common food matrices (cookies, cakes, muffins, breads).
	•	Studies on the formation kinetics of acrylamide and other byproducts in sprinkles during prolonged heat exposure at 120–200 °C, including moisture and sugar interactions with surrounding batter/dough.
	•	Toxicological and environmental persistence studies of colorants, titanium dioxide, polymer/wax coatings, and microplastics in sprinkles, including their survival through composting, wastewater treatment, and soil application.
	•	Waste stream analyses tracking sprinkle additives from food production waste or consumer food scraps into municipal compost, landfill leachate, animal feed, or natural waterways.
	•	Records involving federal contractors (including Palantir Technologies, Accenture Federal Services, Deloitte, Booz Allen Hamilton) modeling sprinkle additive mobility, dietary exposure impacts, or environmental persistence.
	•	Any assessments or policy discussions on the potential contribution of sprinkle-derived compounds to soil microbiome shifts, reactive nitrogen cycling, greenhouse gas emissions, or climate acceleration scenarios.

Keywords: sprinkles, chocolate sprinkles, cocoa powder, caramel color, acrylamide, 4-MEI, Maillard reaction, titanium dioxide, polymer coating, food dyes, microplastics, compost persistence, soil microbiome, greenhouse gas emissions, climate acceleration, Palantir Technologies, Accenture Federal Services, Deloitte, Booz Allen Hamilton
