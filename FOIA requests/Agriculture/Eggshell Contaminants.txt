To USDA (AMS / ARS / NIFA) / FDA / EPA

Request:

Requesting any and all records, laboratory analyses, communications, or program reports concerning contaminant residues in eggshells used in compost, soil amendments, or agricultural reuse from January 1, 2000 to present. Emphasis on heavy metals, pesticides, veterinary drug residues, and persistent pollutants that may leach into soil and affect crops or human health.

This includes:
	•	Laboratory analyses of arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, and other heavy metals in eggshells collected from commercial poultry and their persistence in compost or amended soils
	•	Records on pesticide/herbicide residues (e.g., glyphosate, atrazine, organophosphates, organochlorines) in eggshells derived from poultry feed exposure
	•	Monitoring of veterinary pharmaceuticals in shells, including antibiotics, antifungals, sulfonamides, fluoroquinolones, and hormonal residues
	•	Reports or investigations on microbial contamination of composted eggshells (e.g., Salmonella, Campylobacter, E. coli) and its survival through different composting methods
	•	Studies or pilot projects evaluating dioxins, PCBs, PFAS, or microplastic contamination associated with eggshell disposal streams
	•	Guidance documents or interagency memoranda on the use of eggshells as soil amendments, fertilizers, or animal feed supplements, including risk-benefit assessments
	•	Records of federal contractor involvement (e.g., Palantir Technologies, Accenture Federal Services, Deloitte, Booz Allen Hamilton) in modeling supply chain flows, geofenced distribution, or health/environmental surveillance of eggshell-derived compost
	•	Incident reports or case studies on environmental or human health effects linked to contaminated eggshell compost applications
	•	Interagency communications with USDA extension offices, EPA regional offices, or FDA field staff on consumer distribution programs for eggshell compost and associated residue concerns
