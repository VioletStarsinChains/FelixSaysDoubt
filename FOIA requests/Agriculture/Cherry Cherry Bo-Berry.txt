To U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA – Agricultural Research Service, Economic Research Service, Risk Management Agency, National Agricultural Statistics Service)

Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, technical reports, contracts, genetic studies, internal communications, or policy analyses concerning cherry production, climate adaptation, and hybridization with other Prunus species (plum, peach, apricot, almond) from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) studies on cherry climate sensitivity (chilling requirements, frost tolerance, drought stress) and the development of modified or grafted varieties
	•	Genetic analyses, breeding programs, or grafting trials involving cherry–plum hybrids, cherry rootstocks on plum or peach, or substitution of related Prunus species in commercial supply chains
	•	Economic Research Service (ERS) or Risk Management Agency (RMA) reports evaluating projected yield declines, crop insurance payouts, or climate risk for U.S. cherry producers
	•	NASS survey data or internal communications reconciling cherry acreage/yield statistics with reported market availability or substitution with hybrid fruit varieties
	•	Internal memoranda, white papers, or interagency communications (USDA, land-grant universities, state agricultural departments) concerning the replacement of cherries with alternative Prunus fruits in response to climate change or disease pressure
	•	Contractor or industry partner deliverables related to genetic modification, hybridization, or substitution of cherries in U.S. food systems
