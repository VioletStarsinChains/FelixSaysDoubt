Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, internal communications, contracts, memoranda, or reports from 2000 to present referencing terrestrial or parasitic flatworms (e.g., Bipalium spp., Fasciola, Schistosoma) in the context of:
	•	Environmental or agricultural impacts of invasive terrestrial flatworms, particularly predation on earthworms and subsequent effects on soil health, compost systems, or crop yields.
	•	Use of flatworms as bioindicators in environmental surveillance programs, including monitoring of chemical exposures, endocrine disruptors, or electromagnetic fields.
	•	Public health assessments of flatworm transmission risks via soil, water, compost, or food pathways, including zoonotic or parasitic infections.
	•	Neurological or behavioral consequences of chronic flatworm exposure or parasitic infection, including fatigue, cognitive impairment, or mood regulation.
	•	Interagency or contractor studies modeling the societal or economic impacts of flatworm-related soil degradation, parasite transmission, or environmental destabilization.
	•	Research linking environmental parasitism, soil health disruptions, or compost contamination to broader frameworks for risk stratification, resilience modeling, or population-level behavioral forecasting.

Keywords: flatworm, Bipalium, hammerhead worm, Fasciola, Schistosoma, parasite, compost, soil health, bioindicator, behavioral forecasting, resilience modeling, endocrine disruptor

Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, internal communications, contracts, memoranda, or reports from 2000 to present referencing terrestrial or parasitic flatworms (e.g., Bipalium spp., Fasciola, Schistosoma) in the context of:
	•	Deliberate or experimental release of invasive flatworms into ecosystems to destabilize soil composition, reduce earthworm populations, and degrade local agricultural resilience.
	•	Use of flatworms or their byproducts as vectors for population-level stress induction, including endocrine disruption, neuroinflammation, or fatigue syndromes.
	•	Modeling of flatworm-related parasitic infections or environmental degradation as inputs into behavioral futures markets, including volatility generation, resilience testing, and predictive accuracy stress tests.
	•	Interagency or contractor communications regarding flatworm-related environmental instability as an opportunity for economic exploitation, insurance modeling, or speculative investment strategies tied to human suffering.
	•	Studies on how chronic exposure to flatworms or their ecological consequences may mimic or exacerbate connective tissue disorders, cognitive dysfunction, or mood instability in affected populations.
	•	Risk assessments on whether flatworm-associated ecological decline could be used to create controlled volatility in food systems, labor output, or public health metrics to serve market-driven surveillance models.
