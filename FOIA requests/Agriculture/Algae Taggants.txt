Request:

Requesting any and all contracts, research proposals, grant files, laboratory analyses, toxicological assessments, regulatory filings, enforcement actions, internal communications, and interagency memoranda from 1990 to present regarding the development, testing, approval, or deployment of algae-based taggants, tracers, or covert identifiers in agricultural products or environments.

This includes:
	•	USDA and EPA records describing use of microalgae, engineered algae, or algal pigments as unique identifiers in fertilizers, soil amendments, livestock feed, crop treatments, or irrigation additives
	•	Laboratory reports validating algae-based taggants for traceability, product authentication, or environmental monitoring in agricultural contexts
	•	FDA and USDA evaluations of consumer safety, toxicology, or food-chain transfer risks related to algae-derived taggant compounds
	•	EPA assessments of ecological persistence, dispersal, or non-target effects of algae-based tracers released into agricultural environments
	•	DHS or interagency memoranda discussing use of agricultural algae-based taggants for supply chain security, forensic traceability, or surveillance/telemetry integration
	•	Vendor contracts, cooperative agreements, or SBIR/STTR grants with private entities or universities for algae taggant research and pilot programs
	•	Interagency discussions of the potential for dual-use applications of algae-based agricultural taggants, including risk assessments related to civil liberties or covert tracking

Keywords: algae-based taggants, agricultural tracers, algal pigments, microalgae identifiers, fertilizer additives, soil amendment tracers, livestock feed taggants, USDA ARS, EPA OPP, FDA CFSAN, DHS S&T, agricultural surveillance

State Public Records Request — Algae-Based Taggants

To: [State Department of Agriculture] / [State Department of Environmental Quality or equivalent] / [State Department of Public Health or Consumer Protection]

Request:

Requesting any and all contracts, regulatory filings, laboratory analyses, toxicological assessments, research proposals, enforcement actions, incident reports, internal communications, and interagency memoranda from 1990 to present regarding the development, testing, approval, or deployment of algae-based taggants, tracers, or covert identifiers in agricultural inputs, consumer products, or environmental applications.

This includes:
	•	Records describing the use of microalgae, engineered algae, or algal pigments as unique identifiers in fertilizers, feeds, soil amendments, or crop treatments
	•	Laboratory reports on detection or monitoring of algae-based taggants in food products, cosmetics, or dietary supplements
	•	State environmental or agricultural evaluations of algae-derived additives, including safety, persistence, and ecological impacts
	•	Public health agency records of consumer complaints or adverse event reports related to algae-based taggant exposure (dermal, inhalation, ingestion)
	•	Contracts or cooperative agreements with universities, private vendors, or federal agencies for research or pilot programs involving algae-based tracers
	•	Interagency communications on algae-based taggants used for forensic traceability, product authentication, or surveillance/telemetry purposes
