FOIA — Atmospheric Cavitation and Acoustic Shockwave Research

To U.S. Air Force (AFRL; Air Force Test Center) / DARPA / Department of Homeland Security (Science & Technology Directorate) / National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA, Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research)

Request:

Requesting any and all contracts, research proposals, technical reports, laboratory analyses, field test data, program evaluations, internal communications, and interagency memoranda from 1980 to present concerning atmospheric cavitation, acoustic shockwave generation, or large-scale acoustic propagation experiments producing audible “skyquake” phenomena.

This includes:
	•	DARPA or AFRL studies on ultrasound, infrasound, or pressure pulse technologies capable of producing cavitation or shockwave events in the atmosphere
	•	Field test reports on large-area acoustic propagation, sonic booms, or unexplained aerial detonations not associated with conventional aircraft
	•	NOAA or DHS evaluations of skyquake incidents reported along coastal or inland areas and attribution analyses regarding atmospheric vs. geophysical causes
	•	Contracts or cooperative agreements with academic or private-sector partners to develop atmospheric cavitation modeling tools or to test psychoacoustic effects of large-scale acoustic events
	•	Interagency communications assessing public health, infrastructure stress, or behavioral impacts of unexplained atmospheric acoustic events
	•	Risk–benefit analyses on the potential use of acoustic cavitation/shockwave technologies for defense, area denial, environmental monitoring, or crowd control

Keywords: skyquake, atmospheric cavitation, acoustic shockwave, infrasound, ultrasound, acoustic propagation, DARPA, AFRL, NOAA skyquakes, DHS S&T

FOIA — Ultrasound / Cavitation Testing and Blue Ridge Radiology (NC)

To Department of Defense (U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory; Defense Threat Reduction Agency) / Department of Homeland Security (Science & Technology Directorate) / Food and Drug Administration (Center for Devices and Radiological Health) / National Institutes of Health (NIBIB – Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering)

Request:

Requesting any and all contracts, research proposals, technical reports, regulatory filings, field test records, interagency communications, and internal memoranda from 1990 to present regarding the use of ultrasound or cavitation technologies linked to or conducted in collaboration with Blue Ridge Radiology (North Carolina).

This includes:
	•	Research on the use of medical ultrasound devices or modified ultrasound platforms for non-clinical purposes, including atmospheric cavitation, acoustic propagation, or skyquake-type shockwave testing
	•	Contracts, cooperative agreements, or CRADAs between federal agencies and Blue Ridge Radiology or affiliated contractors for projects involving ultrasound physics, cavitation effects, or behavioral/physiological entrainment
	•	FDA or NIH records concerning dual-use or off-label applications of diagnostic ultrasound devices associated with Blue Ridge Radiology facilities
	•	DoD or DHS S&T evaluations of ultrasound-based cavitation as a defense, area-denial, or psychoacoustic technology, including testing performed in or near civilian environments in North Carolina
	•	Incident reports, community complaints, or state–federal communications regarding unexplained acoustic booms or “skyquake” phenomena in areas proximate to Blue Ridge Radiology
	•	Internal memoranda discussing the public safety, occupational safety, or informed consent implications of using ultrasound equipment or cavitation research outside conventional radiological practice

Keywords: Blue Ridge Radiology, ultrasound cavitation, skyquake testing, acoustic shockwave, atmospheric cavitation, psychoacoustic entrainment, dual-use ultrasound, FDA CDRH, AFRL, DHS S&T
