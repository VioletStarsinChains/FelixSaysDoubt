To Department of Defense / U.S. Marine Corps / Department of Veterans Affairs / Environmental Protection Agency

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, contracts, or internal communications from 1950 to present regarding the use of environmental contamination or environmental modulation at Camp Lejeune (Jacksonville, NC) as a means of medical, behavioral, or compliance testing.

This includes:
	•	Reports on the neurological or psychiatric effects of exposure to trichloroethylene (TCE), perchloroethylene (PCE), benzene, vinyl chloride, or other contaminants found in Camp Lejeune drinking water
	•	Internal communications describing entrainment, stress inoculation, or compliance modeling in relation to long-term toxic exposure of Marines and dependents
	•	Studies evaluating generational health effects (including birth defects, fertility issues, or cancer prevalence) as behavioral datasets
	•	Records of environmental stressors (e.g., hurricanes, flooding, infrastructure collapse) and their framing as resilience or compliance training
	•	Interagency correspondence on narrative management strategies, compensation programs, or data collection from affected populations

Keywords: Camp Lejeune, entrainment, environmental modulation, compliance testing, behavioral conditioning, neurotoxic exposure, resilience modeling, solvent contamination, generational cohort, VA compensation

To Department of Defense / U.S. Marine Corps / Naval Medical Research Center / DARPA

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, communications, or research proposals from 1960 to present concerning the use of Marine Corps bases in North Carolina (Camp Lejeune, MCAS Cherry Point, MCAS New River) as sites for behavioral or neurophysiological conditioning programs.

This includes:
	•	Proposals or pilot projects on stress inoculation training, resilience entrainment, or compliance testing conducted on active-duty Marines or dependents
	•	Communications regarding the use of environmental manipulation (noise, vibration, toxic exposure, or water/air quality changes) to induce behavioral or physiological adaptation
	•	Records of partnerships with defense contractors, private corporations, or academic institutions conducting research into cognitive performance or neuromodulation at NC bases
	•	After-action reports or safety audits involving training accidents, environmental hazards, or mass-exposure events used for behavioral modeling
	•	Interagency or contractor communications on using NC Marine Corps bases as long-term population laboratories for predictive modeling or behavioral futures markets

Keywords: Marine Corps North Carolina, behavioral conditioning, compliance anchor, entrainment, stress inoculation, cognitive performance, DARPA resilience, MCAS Cherry Point, MCAS New River, predictive modeling

To Department of Defense / U.S. Marine Corps / DARPA / Department of Veterans Affairs / Office of Naval Research

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, communications, research proposals, or contractor agreements from 1950 to present referencing the use of Marine Corps facilities in North Carolina (Camp Lejeune, MCAS Cherry Point, MCAS New River) as test sites for behavioral futures markets, predictive modeling, or compliance economics.

This includes:
	•	Records describing how long-term toxic exposure (e.g., solvent-contaminated water at Camp Lejeune) was used to generate predictive health and behavioral datasets
	•	Reports linking training accidents, environmental stressors, or mass-exposure events to compliance modeling or resilience measurement
	•	Proposals for monetizing or contracting population-scale health data from Marines and dependents as behavioral futures commodities
	•	Interagency or contractor communications regarding the framing of environmental contamination as “accidental negligence” while still capturing its predictive modeling value
	•	Risk-benefit analyses, briefing papers, or internal memos on using North Carolina Marine Corps populations as reference cohorts for predictive analytics in military and civilian markets

Keywords: behavioral futures, predictive modeling, compliance economics, Camp Lejeune data, resilience testing, Marine Corps North Carolina, population laboratory, stress inoculation, futures commodities, DARPA
