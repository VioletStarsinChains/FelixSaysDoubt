Request:

Requesting any and all grant proposals, contracts, internal communications, study protocols, or evaluation reports concerning federally funded music therapy research programs that involve the use of musical instruments or performance equipment (including but not limited to electric guitar pickups, microphones, synthesizers, percussion sensors, or other signal-transducing devices) for the collection of physiological, neurological, or behavioral data, from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	NIH or VA grant proposals and funded studies where music therapy interventions also measured biometric or neurological signals during performance or listening sessions
	•	DoD research projects using music therapy or performance contexts for the rehabilitation of veterans or active-duty personnel, particularly where instrumentation was integrated with biometric sensors
	•	Internal communications or technical reports discussing the potential dual-use of musical instruments or audio equipment for biometric monitoring within therapy or performance studies
	•	IRB/ethics reviews and consent documents related to music therapy studies involving biometric or neurological monitoring of participants
	•	Interagency memoranda or contractor reports evaluating the overlap between music therapy, biometric data collection, and potential surveillance or experimental applications

Keywords: music therapy, dual-use instrumentation, biometric monitoring, electric guitar pickup, microphone, synthesizer, PTSD rehabilitation, DoD research, NIH grants, VA healthcare
