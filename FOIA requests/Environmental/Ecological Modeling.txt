Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, research proposals, or internal communications referencing the use of biogeography, avian distribution studies, or ecological indicator species as inputs for predictive modeling of human behavior or population stability, from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Reports linking migratory bird studies or ecological distribution patterns to models of human migration, compliance, or resilience
	•	Communications between environmental scientists and defense/intelligence agencies regarding “indicator species” as early-warning signals of social instability
	•	Contracts or grants awarded for research into cross-applications of ecological data for behavioral futures modeling
	•	Risk/benefit assessments of applying ecological simulation frameworks (“synthetic ecology”) to human populations

Keywords: biogeography, indicator species, avian distribution, ecological modeling, synthetic ecology, population stability, migration modeling, behavioral futures, compliance forecasting, environmental proxy data
