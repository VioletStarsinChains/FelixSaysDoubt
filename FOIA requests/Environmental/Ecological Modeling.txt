Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, research proposals, or internal communications referencing the use of biogeography, avian distribution studies, or ecological indicator species as inputs for predictive modeling of human behavior or population stability, from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Reports linking migratory bird studies or ecological distribution patterns to models of human migration, compliance, or resilience
	•	Communications between environmental scientists and defense/intelligence agencies regarding “indicator species” as early-warning signals of social instability
	•	Contracts or grants awarded for research into cross-applications of ecological data for behavioral futures modeling
	•	Risk/benefit assessments of applying ecological simulation frameworks (“synthetic ecology”) to human populations

Keywords: biogeography, indicator species, avian distribution, ecological modeling, synthetic ecology, population stability, migration modeling, behavioral futures, compliance forecasting, environmental proxy data

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, research proposals, or internal communications referencing the use of geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing, or ecological biogeography as applied to predictive modeling of human behavior or population stability, from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Reports on the use of ecological distribution data (e.g., avian migration, indicator species, habitat range shifts) as proxy variables for human migration or compliance modeling
	•	Communications between environmental researchers and defense/intelligence agencies regarding “synthetic ecology” or cross-application of remote sensing tools to population monitoring
	•	Contracts or grants describing the integration of GIS-based ecological datasets into behavioral futures or risk forecasting platforms
	•	Risk/benefit assessments of adapting ecological simulation frameworks to human populations in the context of national security or resilience planning

Keywords: GIS, remote sensing, biogeography, ecological modeling, synthetic ecology, indicator species, migration forecasting, compliance modeling, population stability, behavioral futures

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, research proposals, or internal communications regarding federally funded projects at Wake Forest University’s Department of Environment and Sustainability that involve the use of ecological or environmental datasets for predictive modeling of human behavior, compliance, or community resilience, from 2010 to present.

This includes:
	•	Reports linking climate adaptation or resilience research to models of social stability or behavioral compliance
	•	Communications between Wake Forest faculty and federal agencies regarding “synthetic ecology” or ecological simulation frameworks applied to human populations
	•	Contracts or grants describing GIS- or remote sensing–based modeling of community adaptation to environmental stressors
	•	Risk/benefit assessments of using environmental curricula or sustainability research as a proxy for behavioral futures training

Keywords: Wake Forest, sustainability, community resilience, synthetic ecology, behavioral compliance, ecological modeling, GIS, remote sensing, adaptation forecasting, population stability
