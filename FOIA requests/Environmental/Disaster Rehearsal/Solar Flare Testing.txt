Request:

Requesting any and all records, reports, or internal communications concerning the accuracy, consistency, or verification of solar flare and geomagnetic storm data, from January 1, 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Internal audits, quality assurance reviews, or contractor deliverables evaluating the reliability of space weather reporting systems (e.g., GOES satellites, DSCOVR, SOHO)
	•	Interagency communications comparing solar flare or geomagnetic event data across NASA, NOAA, and international partners (ESA, JAXA, etc.)
	•	Reports or correspondence addressing discrepancies or anomalies between U.S. datasets and those of allied observatories
	•	Records on protocols for public communication of solar flare severity, including thresholds for issuing alerts and warnings
	•	Documents on the potential for misinterpretation, error, or data corruption in solar weather reporting systems

Keywords: solar flare data, space weather, NOAA, NASA, geomagnetic storms, data integrity, interagency comparison, ESA, JAXA, DSCOVR, GOES

Request:

Requesting any and all records, reports, or interagency communications concerning the use of “solar flare” or “space weather” explanations as cover for defense or environmental technology testing, from January 1, 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Records describing instances where environmental or electromagnetic field tests (RF, ELF, microwave, plasma, or ionospheric manipulation) produced effects attributed publicly to solar activity
	•	Interagency communications acknowledging the use of solar flare events as a cover story for grid disruptions, communications outages, or aerospace anomalies
	•	Research proposals, contracts, or program evaluations involving defense technologies (e.g., ionospheric heaters, directed energy, atmospheric plasma) where solar weather was cited as an explanatory framework
	•	Reports assessing public perception, communication strategies, or risk management related to using “space weather” as an attribution for artificial effects
	•	Contractor deliverables or DARPA program materials referencing solar flares in the context of resilience testing, attrition simulations, or data obfuscation

Keywords: solar flares, space weather cover, electromagnetic testing, ionospheric manipulation, DARPA, DoD, ODNI, NOAA, NASA, RF exposure, directed energy
