NWS/NESDIS) / Federal Communications Commission (FCC)

Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, contracts, experimental plans, after-action reports, interagency communications, risk assessments, procurement records, and policy memoranda from January 1, 1980 to present concerning seismic modulation, earthquake preparedness exercises, and population-level behavioral modeling in the New Madrid Seismic Zone (NMSZ), including the Memphis metropolitan area.

This includes:
	•	Research on ionospheric heating, ELF/VLF transmissions, or RF energy injection and their potential coupling to tectonic stress release, microseismic activity, or induced earthquakes in the New Madrid fault system
	•	Contracts, SOWs, or deliverables involving AFRL, DARPA, NRL, or academic/contractor partners studying tectonic stress modulation, plasma-lithosphere interactions, or “tectonic weapons” concepts
	•	After-action reports, planning documents, and public communication strategies from FEMA catastrophic earthquake exercises (e.g., NLE 2011, CAPSTONE-14, New Madrid Seismic Zone Catastrophic Planning Initiative) focused on Memphis and surrounding areas
	•	Internal communications describing earthquake drills or predictions as “compliance rehearsals,” “resilience modeling,” or “anticipatory entrainment” of Memphis/NMSZ populations
	•	Data collected from evacuation drills, panic management efforts, or emergency mass-care simulations in Memphis and nearby regions, including communications about predictive analytics, compliance rates, or demographic segmentation
	•	Spectrum authorizations, FCC experimental licenses, or coordination records for high-power RF/ELF transmissions coinciding with seismic monitoring campaigns in the Mid-South region
	•	Interagency correspondence with USGS or NOAA concerning whether unusual seismic swarms or anomalies may be associated with ionospheric/atmospheric experiments
	•	Epidemiological or sociological reports examining the psychological and behavioral effects of repeated public messaging that Memphis is “overdue” for an earthquake

Keywords: Memphis, New Madrid Seismic Zone, ELF/VLF, ionospheric heating, tectonic stress release, induced seismicity, earthquake preparedness, FEMA NLE 2011, CAPSTONE-14, compliance rehearsal, resilience modeling, anticipatory entrainment, AFRL/DARPA

Request:

Requesting any and all contracts, memoranda of understanding, research proposals, interagency communications, workforce studies, or contractor deliverables from January 1, 1990 to present concerning FedEx Corporation (Memphis, TN headquarters) in the context of time-motion studies, workforce behavioral modeling, predictive logistics, or resilience/compliance testing.

This includes:
	•	Contracts, CRADAs, or pilot projects involving FedEx data on package-handling, hub logistics, and worker efficiency as inputs for predictive modeling or behavioral futures markets
	•	Communications or reports describing the use of time-study / stopwatch analyses at FedEx hubs as compliance anchors or resilience metrics in workforce environments
	•	Studies, datasets, or deliverables where FedEx workforce behavior was modeled for national security, supply chain resilience, or predictive logistics applications
	•	Interagency communications between DoD/DHS/FAA/TSA/USPS and FedEx regarding logistics exercises, stress inoculation, or catastrophic preparedness (e.g., New Madrid earthquake scenarios impacting Memphis hub operations)
	•	Records of any FedEx workforce or logistics analytics provided to federal agencies for training, simulation, or predictive futures contracting
	•	Briefing decks, dashboards, or analytic outputs framing FedEx hub operations as a model for population-level compliance, behavioral entrainment, or resilience under stress

Keywords: FedEx Memphis, workforce behavioral modeling, time-motion study, compliance anchor, predictive logistics, resilience metrics, CRADA, DoD DHS contracts, hub operations, catastrophic preparedness, behavioral futures

Request:

Requesting any and all contracts, scenario plans, tabletop exercises, interagency communications, after-action reports, modeling datasets, or procurement records from January 1, 1990 to present referencing FedEx Corporation (Memphis, TN headquarters and Superhub) in the context of New Madrid Seismic Zone earthquake planning, catastrophic logistics continuity, or behavioral/compliance modeling of workforce and civilian populations.

This includes:
	•	FEMA, NORTHCOM, or USTRANSCOM plans describing Memphis/FedEx hub vulnerability during NMSZ catastrophic earthquake scenarios (e.g., NLE 2011, CAPSTONE-14)
	•	Reports, dashboards, or contractor deliverables analyzing resilience of FedEx operations and its workforce as a model for national compliance and predictive futures markets
	•	Communications describing FedEx workforce behavior, absenteeism, or compliance during prior earthquake drills or catastrophic preparedness exercises
	•	Records of FedEx participation in DHS/FEMA catastrophic planning initiatives, including MOU/MOA documents, tabletop scenario planning, and interagency task force minutes
	•	Risk assessments, briefing papers, or white papers describing FedEx hub operations in Memphis as a “single point of failure” for national supply chain stability, and analysis of how population compliance could be maintained under conditions of mass disruption
	•	Datasets, analytic products, or research proposals modeling panic behavior, compliance anchors, and resilience metrics derived from FedEx workforce or regional Memphis population under earthquake scenarios
	•	Any interagency communications on leveraging FedEx hub operations in Memphis for population-level behavioral entrainment, stress inoculation, or disaster compliance testing during catastrophic NMSZ exercises
