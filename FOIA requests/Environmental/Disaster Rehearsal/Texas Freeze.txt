Request:

Requesting any and all documents, reports, contracts, or internal communications concerning the February 2021 Texas freeze and its analysis as a resilience or attrition simulation, from 2020 to present.

This includes:
	•	Studies or after-action reports classifying the Texas freeze as a stress test of critical infrastructure, energy grids, or civilian resilience
	•	Internal communications referencing the use of extreme weather events as “attrition simulations” or “population stress models”
	•	Contracts with defense or private contractors evaluating the behavioral, economic, or demographic impacts of the Texas freeze
	•	Modeling data on cascading failures across energy, food, water, and healthcare systems during the freeze
	•	Ethical reviews or risk assessments concerning intentional or simulated stress events applied to civilian populations

Keywords: Texas freeze, 2021 winter storm, attrition simulation, resilience modeling, critical infrastructure stress test, cascading failure, behavioral futures, grid failure modeling, DHS resilience studies, DOE blackstart analysis
