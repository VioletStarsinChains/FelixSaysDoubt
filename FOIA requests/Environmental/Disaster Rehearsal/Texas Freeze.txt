To Department of Defense / Department of Energy / DHS / NOAA

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, reports, contracts, or internal communications concerning the February 2021 Texas freeze and its analysis as a resilience or attrition simulation, from 2020 to present.

This includes:
	•	Studies or after-action reports classifying the Texas freeze as a stress test of critical infrastructure, energy grids, or civilian resilience
	•	Internal communications referencing the use of extreme weather events as “attrition simulations” or “population stress models”
	•	Contracts with defense or private contractors evaluating the behavioral, economic, or demographic impacts of the Texas freeze
	•	Modeling data on cascading failures across energy, food, water, and healthcare systems during the freeze
	•	Ethical reviews or risk assessments concerning intentional or simulated stress events applied to civilian populations

Keywords: Texas freeze, 2021 winter storm, attrition simulation, resilience modeling, critical infrastructure stress test, cascading failure, behavioral futures, grid failure modeling, DHS resilience studies, DOE blackstart analysis

To ERCOT / Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, reports, contracts, or internal communications concerning the February 2021 Texas freeze and its analysis as a resilience or attrition simulation, from 2020 to present.

This includes:
	•	ERCOT and FERC after-action reports framing the Texas freeze as a stress test of grid stability or civilian resilience
	•	Communications regarding the use of large-scale power outages as “attrition simulations” or “infrastructure stress events”
	•	Contracts with private or federal partners for resilience modeling, blackstart simulations, or behavioral impact assessments linked to the freeze
	•	Studies of cascading failures across water, healthcare, communications, and energy systems during the blackout period
	•	Risk assessments or ethical reviews concerning the framing of the Texas freeze as a deliberate or simulated attrition event

Keywords: Texas freeze, 2021 winter storm, ERCOT blackout, attrition simulation, resilience modeling, cascading failure, blackstart, grid collapse, stress test, behavioral futures
