To: U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA / ARS), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Energy (DOE), and Department of Defense (DARPA / Logistics)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, technical reports, or research proposals from 2000 to present concerning the development, testing, or procurement of biodegradable or “eco-friendly” packing materials derived from organic feedstocks.

This includes:
	•	Research on biodegradable packing peanuts or foams manufactured from plant starches, proteins, or cellulose, as well as any studies on the feasibility of animal- or human-derived organic inputs (e.g., collagen, gelatin, keratin, bone meal, microbial cellulose).
	•	Reports or deliverables evaluating the potential use of organic waste streams (animal byproducts, medical waste, mortuary remains, agricultural waste) in sustainable packaging initiatives.
	•	Interagency communications between USDA, EPA, DOE, and DoD regarding supply chain feasibility, health risks, or environmental assessments of biodegradable packing materials that could incorporate nontraditional organic sources.
	•	Contractor proposals or white papers submitted under “green chemistry,” “sustainable packaging,” or “circular economy” initiatives that reference protein-based foams, collagen/gelatin composites, or other organic remains as feedstocks.
	•	Risk-benefit analyses, audits, or regulatory assessments addressing public health, cross-contamination, or allergenicity risks in packaging derived from organic waste streams.

Keywords: biodegradable packing peanuts, starch-based foams, protein-based foams, collagen, gelatin, keratin, bone meal, microbial cellulose, organic waste feedstock, sustainable packaging, circular economy

To: Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA), Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA), Minnesota Department of Commerce – Division of Energy Resources, and the University of Minnesota (College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences; Department of Bioproducts and Biosystems Engineering)

Pursuant to the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act, I am requesting access to any and all records from 2000 to present concerning the development, testing, or procurement of biodegradable or “eco-friendly” packing materials derived from organic feedstocks.

This includes:
	•	Research on biodegradable packing peanuts, foams, or filler materials made from starch, proteins, cellulose, or other biomaterials, including any feasibility studies on animal- or human-derived organic inputs (e.g., collagen, gelatin, keratin, bone meal, microbial cellulose).
	•	Reports or communications on the potential use of organic waste streams (agricultural byproducts, animal processing waste, mortuary or medical remains, forestry residues) as feedstocks for packaging.
	•	Contracts, grants, or agreements with private vendors or university researchers under “green chemistry,” “sustainable packaging,” “circular economy,” or “waste-to-value” initiatives.
	•	Risk assessments, audits, or evaluations discussing public health, allergenicity, or environmental safety in packaging products derived from nontraditional organic inputs.
	•	Interagency or university communications concerning pilot programs or demonstration projects for biodegradable packaging made from organic remains.

Keywords: biodegradable packing peanuts, starch-based foams, protein-based foams, collagen, gelatin, keratin, bone meal, microbial cellulose, organic waste feedstock, sustainable packaging, circular economy, waste-to-value
