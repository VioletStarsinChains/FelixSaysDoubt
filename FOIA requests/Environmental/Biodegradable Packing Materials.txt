To: U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA / ARS), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Energy (DOE), and Department of Defense (DARPA / Logistics)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, technical reports, or research proposals from 2000 to present concerning the development, testing, or procurement of biodegradable or “eco-friendly” packing materials derived from organic feedstocks.

This includes:
	•	Research on biodegradable packing peanuts or foams manufactured from plant starches, proteins, or cellulose, as well as any studies on the feasibility of animal- or human-derived organic inputs (e.g., collagen, gelatin, keratin, bone meal, microbial cellulose).
	•	Reports or deliverables evaluating the potential use of organic waste streams (animal byproducts, medical waste, mortuary remains, agricultural waste) in sustainable packaging initiatives.
	•	Interagency communications between USDA, EPA, DOE, and DoD regarding supply chain feasibility, health risks, or environmental assessments of biodegradable packing materials that could incorporate nontraditional organic sources.
	•	Contractor proposals or white papers submitted under “green chemistry,” “sustainable packaging,” or “circular economy” initiatives that reference protein-based foams, collagen/gelatin composites, or other organic remains as feedstocks.
	•	Risk-benefit analyses, audits, or regulatory assessments addressing public health, cross-contamination, or allergenicity risks in packaging derived from organic waste streams.

Keywords: biodegradable packing peanuts, starch-based foams, protein-based foams, collagen, gelatin, keratin, bone meal, microbial cellulose, organic waste feedstock, sustainable packaging, circular economy
