To DARPA / Department of Defense / Department of Homeland Security

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, communications, or research reports regarding the development, testing, and deployment of synthetic spider silk materials used as taggants, identifiers, or environmental markers for surveillance, behavioral modeling, or tracking purposes, from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Research into spider silk biomimicry for persistent environmental taggants or forensic tracers
	•	Contracts with private sector or academic labs for silk-based tagging technologies
	•	Field testing reports of spider silk or polymer analogues in urban or natural environments
	•	Communications regarding integration of spider silk taggants into biosurveillance or biometric monitoring programs
	•	Safety and efficacy assessments, particularly regarding inadvertent exposure of civilian populations
	•	Cross-agency discussions on behavioral effects of repeated encounters with synthetic spider web structures
	•	References to spider silk materials in predictive modeling or behavioral futures market datasets

Keywords: synthetic spider silk, taggants, biomimetic surveillance, environmental markers, behavioral telemetry, polymer webbing, DARPA, forensic tracers, biosurveillance, predictive modeling

To FBI (Laboratory Division; Operational Technology Division; Behavioral Analysis Unit) / U.S. Department of Justice (Criminal Division; Office of Justice Programs; National Institute of Justice)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, contracts, purchase orders, technical evaluations, laboratory methods, field test reports, internal communications, and interagency memoranda referencing the use of synthetic spider silk or spider‑silk–analog materials as taggants, identifiers, or environmental markers for surveillance, forensic evidence handling, controlled operations, behavioral modeling, or tracking purposes, from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Validation studies and SOPs for silk-based or polymer webbing taggants used in evidence tagging, scene marking, or suspect transfer (trace) applications
	•	NIJ-funded grants, statements of work, and deliverables related to biomimetic silk, recombinant silk proteins, or polymer analogs as forensic microtaggants
	•	FBI Laboratory notes, method development files, chain-of-custody guidance, and sensitivity/specificity assessments for silk-derived tracers (including fluorescent or isotopically encoded variants)
	•	OTD (Operational Technology Division) briefs on deployment concepts, field trials, or integration with location telemetry, UV/IR detection kits, or aerosolized dispersal systems
	•	Behavioral Analysis Unit (or equivalent) communications regarding conditioning effects of repeated public encounters with synthetic “spider web” constructs and any observed compliance or avoidance responses
	•	CJIS or other data holdings describing classification, retention, or query of spider‑silk taggant hits, including schema, metadata fields, and cross-agency sharing rules
	•	DOJ Criminal Division memoranda on legal authorities, minimization, public exposure risk assessments, and prosecutorial use of silk-based taggants in investigations and prosecutions

Keywords: synthetic spider silk, forensic microtaggants, recombinant silk protein, polymer webbing, environmental marker, evidence tagging, FBI Laboratory, NIJ, CJIS, OTD, behavioral conditioning, surveillance telemetry
