To Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) / Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) / Office of Land & Emergency Management (OLEM) / Office of Emergency Management (OEM) / Superfund (CERCLA) Program / EPA Regions 5–7

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, internal communications, inspection/sampling records, enforcement actions, emergency planning documents, contractor task orders, and interagency correspondence referencing the storage, staging, disposal, or repackaging of tactical herbicides or high-potency defoliants in abandoned or unoccupied residential properties (“dead houses”), urban lots, or foreclosed/condemned structures within the United States, from January 1, 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Site files, complaints, or incident reports noting herbicide/defoliant presence in residential/urban structures, including environmental sampling (soil, dust, water) and hazard assessments
	•	Records referencing Agent Orange/White/Blue or constituents (2,4-D; 2,4,5-T; picloram; cacodylic acid), or modern analogs (glyphosate, imazapyr) at tactical concentrations
	•	Emergency response pre-plans, exclusion-zone designations, or color-coded markings/signage protocols for structures used for hazardous chemical staging (including references to blue/orange/white)
	•	Notices of violation, consent decrees, or remedial action plans related to herbicide/defoliant storage/disposal in residential areas; Superfund/NPL or Brownfields linkages
	•	Interagency communications with DoD, USACE, state environmental agencies, or local utilities regarding coordinated shutdowns (water/gas/electric) for hazmat reasons at abandoned homes
	•	Contractor SOWs, purchase orders, and waste manifests referencing herbicide consolidation, transfer, or disposal originating from residential properties
	•	Risk assessments addressing wildfire susceptibility or vegetation die-off tied to chemical defoliation near urban or WUI neighborhoods

Keywords: Agent Orange, Agent White, Agent Blue, 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T, picloram, cacodylic acid, imazapyr, glyphosate, abandoned/condemned houses, hazmat staging, blue-orange-white markings, exclusion zone, WUI, CERCLA

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, internal communications, storage/transport logs, installation environmental records, contractor task orders, emergency response plans, and interagency correspondence referencing the storage, staging, transit, or disposal of tactical herbicides/defoliants (including Agent Orange/White/Blue; 2,4-D; 2,4,5-T; picloram; cacodylic acid; and modern analogs such as glyphosate/imazapyr at tactical concentrations) in abandoned or unoccupied residential properties (“dead houses”) or urban lots adjacent to or within DoD-managed areas, from January 1, 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Records identifying non-installation structures (abandoned residences, foreclosed/condemned buildings) used as temporary or covert storage points for herbicides/defoliants or related wastes
	•	Maps, pre-incident plans, or security assessments designating urban exclusion zones or utility shutoffs linked to chemical storage/staging
	•	Guidance, SOPs, or visual marking/flagging protocols (including any reference to blue/orange/white) for identifying or coding off-books hazmat locations
	•	USACE remedial investigations/feasibility studies (RI/FS), removal action reports, or FUDS/FUSRAP analogs addressing herbicide residues in residential contexts contiguous with defense activities
	•	DLA procurement, warehousing, and disposition records for herbicide/defoliant stocks and any documentation of overflow or off-site staging in civilian structures
	•	Interagency communications with EPA, state environmental agencies, local emergency management, or utilities regarding coordination for hazmat stabilization in abandoned homes
	•	Risk analyses linking defoliant use/storage to vegetation die-off and elevated wildfire susceptibility near urban or WUI corridors

Keywords: Agent Orange, Agent White, Agent Blue, 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T, picloram, cacodylic acid, glyphosate, imazapyr, abandoned residential storage, hazmat staging, blue-orange-white, exclusion zones, USACE/AFCEC, DLA logistics, WUI
