Request:

Requesting any and all documents, interagency communications, research proposals, surveillance reports, or environmental health assessments from January 1, 2000 to present regarding wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) populations in residential and suburban environments as potential vectors of environmental contamination or adverse health outcomes.

This includes:
	•	Studies or monitoring data on microbial pathogens spread via wild turkey feces, feathers, or carcasses in urban/suburban areas (e.g., Salmonella, Campylobacter, Listeria, Clostridium, Francisella tularensis, avian influenza, West Nile virus).
	•	Environmental testing or incident reports linking wild turkey activity to contaminated playgrounds, schoolyards, or residential parks.
	•	Risk assessments of heavy metal, pesticide, herbicide, or microplastic transfer from urban soils into turkey droppings or feathers.
	•	Evaluations of turkeys as bridging vectors for tick-borne diseases (Lyme, babesiosis) between wild habitats and residential neighborhoods.
	•	Interagency discussions on mitigation strategies, population control, or communication plans regarding wild turkey contamination risks.
	•	Contracts, cooperative research agreements, or technology pilots involving USDA Wildlife Services or DARPA on urban/suburban turkey population management.

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, studies, communications, or population management reports from January 1, 2000 to present regarding wild turkey populations in Minnesota residential and suburban areas and their potential role in environmental contamination or public health risks.

This includes:
	•	Wildlife surveys documenting turkey movement into suburban neighborhoods and public parks.
	•	Correspondence with MDH or MPCA regarding microbial contamination of residential spaces by wild turkey feces, feathers, or carcasses.
	•	Investigations into reported incidents of playgrounds, schoolyards, or water features contaminated by turkey droppings.
	•	Risk assessments or advisories related to zoonotic pathogens (Histoplasma, Salmonella, Campylobacter, avian influenza, tularemia).
	•	Data on heavy metal, pesticide, or microplastic residues associated with turkey scavenging in urban environments.
	•	Mitigation strategies (population reduction, habitat modification, public communication campaigns) to limit wild turkey impacts in neighborhoods.
	•	Collaborative research or communications between DNR and USDA Wildlife Services on Minnesota turkey population management.
