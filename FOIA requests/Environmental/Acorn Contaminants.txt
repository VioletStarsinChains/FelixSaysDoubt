FOIA — Acorns as Bioindicators of Soil and Environmental Contaminants

To U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA Forest Service / Agricultural Research Service) / U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) / Environmental Protection Agency (EPA, Office of Research and Development / Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention)

Request:

Requesting any and all contracts, research proposals, technical reports, laboratory analyses, internal communications, regulatory filings, interagency memoranda, and program evaluations from 1980 to present regarding the use of acorns (Quercus spp.) as bioindicators of soil, air, or water contamination and the accumulation of toxins in acorns relevant to wildlife and human health.

This includes:
	•	Studies on uptake and accumulation of heavy metals (lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic) in acorns from contaminated soils or urban/industrial areas
	•	Research on acorns absorbing or concentrating radionuclides (e.g., cesium-137, strontium-90) in areas impacted by nuclear testing or fallout
	•	Analyses of persistent organic pollutants (POPs, PCBs, dioxins, PAHs) or pesticide residues detected in acorns or oak forest ecosystems
	•	USDA Forest Service or ARS reports on livestock or wildlife poisoning from gallotannins, tannins, or environmental contaminants in acorns
	•	EPA or USGS evaluations of acorns as a low-cost bioindicator tool for ecosystem monitoring, soil remediation projects, or long-term pollutant tracking
	•	Interagency discussions regarding acorn contamination and its implications for food safety, cultural uses (acorn flour), or indigenous subsistence practices
	•	Risk–benefit analyses of acorns in ecotoxicology studies and food chain transfer models

Keywords: acorn contamination, oak bioindicators, heavy metal uptake, radionuclide accumulation, POPs in acorns, USDA Forest Service, USGS ecotoxicology, EPA Office of Research, tannin toxicity, wildlife poisoning
