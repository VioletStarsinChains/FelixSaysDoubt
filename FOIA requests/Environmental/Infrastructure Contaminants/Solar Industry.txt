To Department of Energy (DOE) / Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) / Department of Homeland Security (DHS)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, reports, contracts, or interagency correspondence from 2015 to present concerning federal analysis of the February 2021 Texas power grid failure and extreme cold weather event.

This includes:
	•	Records on grid resilience testing, outage response, and infrastructure vulnerabilities revealed by the storm
	•	Reports evaluating household-level or community-level survival outcomes following extended power loss
	•	Contracts or research proposals involving energy utilities (including ERCOT) and federal agencies regarding cold weather preparedness
	•	Internal communications concerning lessons learned from the event and recommendations for preventing similar grid disruptions
	•	Federal involvement in monitoring or analyzing population displacement, health outcomes, or public safety during and after the storm

Keywords: Texas freeze, grid resilience, ERCOT, power outage, cold weather event, resilience testing, infrastructure vulnerability, DOE, FERC, DHS

SPICY VERSION

To Department of Energy (DOE) / Department of Homeland Security (DHS) / Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) / DARPA

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, research proposals, or internal memoranda from 2015 to present concerning the use of the February 2021 Texas power grid failure and extreme cold weather event as an attrition simulation or behavioral modeling exercise.

This includes:
	•	Records of federally sponsored research into household- or community-level compliance testing during prolonged deprivation events
	•	Documents concerning ERCOT or other utilities providing real-time consumer usage data to federal agencies for behavioral futures modeling
	•	Internal communications on selective or rolling outages as a tool for differential survival analysis
	•	Reports or proposals linking the Texas freeze to predictive models of migration, housing demand, political realignment, or compliance under environmental stress
	•	Contracts with private vendors, defense contractors, or behavioral analytics firms involved in analyzing population responses during the freeze

Keywords: Texas freeze, attrition simulation, ERCOT, behavioral modeling, rolling outage, compliance testing, survival analysis, behavioral futures markets, resilience data, selective deprivation

PUBLIC HEALTH COVER VERSION

To Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) / Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) / Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, reports, contracts, or interagency correspondence from 2015 to present concerning federal monitoring of public health outcomes during and after the February 2021 Texas power grid failure and extreme cold weather event.

This includes:
	•	Records of excess mortality, hospitalization, or morbidity analyses linked to the storm and associated outages
	•	Reports on health disparities in affected populations, including vulnerable groups (elderly, disabled, unhoused, medically fragile)
	•	Contracts or agreements with state and local health departments to track emergency room visits, hypothermia cases, and infrastructure-related injuries
	•	Internal communications regarding federal recommendations for preventing mortality in future cold-weather grid failures
	•	Research proposals or after-action reviews addressing household- and community-level resilience in relation to prolonged loss of utilities

Keywords: Texas freeze, public health impact, mortality analysis, morbidity, hypothermia, hospitalization, resilience, CDC, HHS, FEMA
