Request:

Requesting any and all records, internal communications, contracts, or research proposals regarding the use of cremated human remains (cremains) or other human-derived materials as fillers or additives in tire or rubber manufacturing, from 2000 to present.

This includes:
	•	Research on the substitution of cremains or bone ash for carbon black, silica, or mineral fillers in tire compounds
	•	Risk assessments on the public health and environmental effects of tire dust if human remains or associated toxic metals (e.g., mercury, lead from implants, chemotherapy residues) were incorporated
	•	Oversight or contractor reports concerning the dispersion of human-derived particulates through tire wear in air, soil, or water
	•	Interagency communications or regulatory reviews on the ethical, legal, or safety implications of incorporating cremains into industrial rubber products
	•	Pilot projects, patents, or vendor contracts involving novel fillers in tire production that may include human-derived inputs

Keywords: cremains, cremated remains, human ashes, bone ash, tire dust, rubber manufacturing, carbon black substitute, silica substitute, environmental contamination, toxic metals
