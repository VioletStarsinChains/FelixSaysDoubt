FOIA – Metals in Human Waste & Resource Recovery

To: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) / Department of Energy (DOE) / National Institutes of Health (NIH)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, reports, contracts, or interagency communications from 2000 to present concerning the recovery of metals and minerals from human waste streams, including urine, feces, sweat, hair, and wastewater.

This includes:
	•	Studies measuring concentrations of critical metals (copper, zinc, manganese, cobalt, nickel, rare earth elements) in human excreta
	•	Reports on wastewater treatment plants or municipal programs piloting metal recovery or resource reclamation from sewage sludge
	•	Contracts with universities, laboratories, or private companies to develop technologies for extracting metals from human-derived waste
	•	Environmental impact assessments related to biosolids management and potential industrial reuse of metals
	•	Analyses comparing human waste streams to other sources of critical mineral recycling

Keywords: wastewater, sewage sludge, biosolids, metal recovery, copper reclamation, zinc recovery, DOE, EPA, NIH, wastewater treatment

FOIA (Spicy Angle – Continuity Theater & Strategic Mineral Recovery from Populations)

To: Department of Defense (DoD) / DARPA / Department of Homeland Security (DHS) / Department of Energy (DOE)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, contracts, reports, or internal analyses from 2000 to present concerning the recovery of strategic or critical minerals from human populations via excretion, framed as continuity theater or national resource resilience.

This includes:
	•	Records describing the use of population-wide drug regimens (e.g., GLP-1 receptor agonists, chelators, fibrosis-reversing agents) to mobilize tissue-sequestered metals into excreta
	•	Reports on the collection, concentration, or industrial recovery of metals from urine, feces, sweat, hair, or other human-derived waste streams
	•	Communications regarding continuity-of-operations or population resilience programs that integrate human waste into the critical mineral supply chain
	•	Analyses linking biomedical interventions to strategic mineral recovery or resource security frameworks
	•	Risk/benefit assessments of large-scale human waste mining for defense, energy, or technology sectors

Keywords: continuity theater, human waste mining, metal recovery, strategic minerals, GLP-1, biosurveillance, DARPA, DOE, DoD, DHS
