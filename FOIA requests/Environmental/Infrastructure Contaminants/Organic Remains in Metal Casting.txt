To Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) / U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) / National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, laboratory analyses, industrial standards, interagency communications, or oversight reports from 1990 to present concerning the use of organic-derived materials, cremated remains, bone ash, human hair, or other human/animal remains in metallurgical processes involved in the manufacture of bolts, nuts, fasteners, or other hardware components.

This includes:
	•	Records describing the use of bone ash, cremains, or organic remains as fluxes, mold-release agents, or fillers in foundry operations and metal casting.
	•	Documentation of cremains or organic remains being used as carbon sources in steelmaking or alloy production.
	•	Laboratory analyses or supplier certifications identifying organic-derived materials in powder metallurgy inputs used for fasteners, bolts, or similar hardware.
	•	OSHA or DOE safety assessments concerning worker exposure risks during the use of cremains, bone ash, or keratin powders in forging, casting, or finishing operations.
	•	NIST standards, research, or testing protocols addressing the incorporation of organic remains into metals or surface finishing compounds for hardware.

Keywords: metallurgy, steelmaking, casting flux, powder metallurgy, bone ash, cremains, cremated remains, carbon source, fasteners, bolts, nuts, OSHA, DOE, NIST
