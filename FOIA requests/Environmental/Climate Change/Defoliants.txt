To Department of Defense (DoD) / U.S. Air Force / U.S. Army Corps of Engineers

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, internal communications, contracts, field reports, and environmental assessments from January 1, 1990 to present referencing the use, testing, storage, or experimental deployment of tactical herbicides (including but not limited to 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T, Agent Orange, Agent White, Agent Blue, picloram, imazapyr, glyphosate at tactical concentrations) in the continental United States for the purposes of vegetation management, defoliation, or fire control.

This includes:
	•	Records of aerial or ground spraying missions on or near military training ranges, buffer zones, or communities adjacent to installations
	•	Environmental impact assessments and risk analyses concerning increased wildfire susceptibility after vegetation die-off
	•	Interagency communications with USDA, USFS, EPA, or state authorities regarding tactical or experimental herbicide use for fire modeling, fuel load management, or vegetation clearing
	•	Storage, transport, or disposal logs of legacy defoliants at domestic bases (including Little Rock AFB and other herbicide transit/storage sites)
	•	Research proposals or DARPA/DoD-funded projects assessing the behavioral, ecological, or infrastructure impacts of wildfire scenarios created through chemical vegetation management

Keywords: Agent Orange, Agent White, Agent Blue, tactical herbicide, vegetation management, defoliation, wildfire susceptibility, fire modeling, Army Corps, DARPA, LRAFB

To U.S. Forest Service (USFS) / U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, internal communications, contracts, and environmental assessments from January 1, 1990 to present referencing the use of tactical herbicides or high-potency vegetation-control chemicals (including 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T, picloram, glyphosate, imazapyr, or related compounds) on U.S. national forests, state-managed forests, or public lands for purposes of wildfire prevention, wildfire modeling, or vegetation management.

This includes:
	•	Pilot programs or field experiments linking herbicide use to fire behavior modeling or controlled burn dynamics
	•	Incident reports or environmental monitoring documenting abnormal vegetation die-off followed by increased wildfire risk
	•	Contracts or correspondence with private vendors or defense agencies regarding large-scale herbicide spraying campaigns
	•	Studies analyzing herbicide-induced vegetation mortality as a variable in fire-spread models
	•	Interagency communications with EPA, DoD, or state forestry agencies regarding fire risk from chemical vegetation control

Keywords: wildfire modeling, defoliant, vegetation die-off, glyphosate, imazapyr, picloram, Agent Orange, USDA Forest Service, herbicide spraying, fire behavior experiment

To Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) / Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) / Office of Research and Development (ORD)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, risk assessments, internal communications, contracts, enforcement actions, and interagency correspondence from January 1, 1990 to present regarding the intentional use of herbicides/defoliants (including 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T, glyphosate, imazapyr, picloram, or legacy Agent Orange-class compounds) to alter wildfire susceptibility, vegetation density, or forest management outcomes.

This includes:
	•	Pesticide registration or experimental use permit files referencing “fuel load reduction,” “fire modeling,” or “wildfire susceptibility” as endpoints
	•	Laboratory or field studies on the role of herbicides in increasing flammability or dry biomass
	•	Communications with USDA, DoD, USFS, or state fire agencies regarding herbicide-linked wildfire modeling or defoliant-driven vegetation control
	•	Enforcement or compliance records related to undisclosed large-scale spraying programs impacting fire behavior

Keywords: pesticide permit, experimental use, wildfire susceptibility, defoliant, glyphosate, imazapyr, 2,4-D, Agent Orange, fire modeling, EPA OPP
