FOIA Request: Smart Irrigation & Aerosolized Water Recycling

To: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA – Office of Water) / Department of Agriculture (USDA – Natural Resources Conservation Service) / Department of Energy (DOE – Building Technologies Office, Water Power Technologies Office)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, contracts, grants, reports, or interagency communications from 2000 to present concerning the development, deployment, or evaluation of smart irrigation systems or aerosolized water recycling technologies in residential, commercial, or public landscapes.

This includes:
	•	Research on sprinkler systems that use mist, fog, or aerosolized particles rather than traditional water spray
	•	Contracts with vendors for “smart” or sensor-enabled irrigation devices in federally funded projects
	•	Reports on water conservation or efficiency outcomes from aerosol-based irrigation pilots
	•	Communications regarding the environmental or health safety of aerosolized irrigation systems
	•	Records of federal or municipal programs testing or subsidizing “smart sprinkler” technology in parks, neighborhoods, or government campuses

Keywords: smart irrigation, aerosolized sprinklers, water recycling, mist irrigation, fog irrigation, EPA, USDA, DOE

FOIA Request: Sonic / Ultrasonic Shower and Cleaning Technologies

To: Department of Energy (DOE – Building Technologies Office) / Environmental Protection Agency (EPA – Office of Water) / Department of Defense (DoD – Office of Operational Energy, USAMRDC)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, contracts, reports, or interagency communications from 1990 to present concerning the development, testing, or deployment of sonic or ultrasonic cleaning and shower technologies intended as alternatives to traditional water-based hygiene systems.

This includes:
	•	Records of research and pilot projects involving ultrasonic showers or low-water/no-water cleaning systems
	•	Contracts with vendors or universities to develop vibration-based or air-jet hygiene technologies for military, residential, or commercial use
	•	Reports on energy and water conservation outcomes from ultrasonic shower demonstrations
	•	Communications regarding potential adoption of sonic shower systems in government facilities, military housing, or sustainability programs
	•	Records assessing public health or safety implications of sonic/ultrasonic hygiene systems

Keywords: sonic shower, ultrasonic cleaning, no-water hygiene, water conservation, DOE, EPA, DoD, pilot project
