To Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) / Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) / National Institutes of Health (NIH) / Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) / Department of Defense (DoD, incl. Navy/Army Mortuary Affairs)

Request:

Requesting any and all monitoring reports, emissions testing data, contractor deliverables, internal memoranda, or interagency communications from January 1, 2000 to present concerning crematory emissions in the United States, with particular reference to the detection of non-traditional or novel materials released during cremation.

This includes:
	•	EPA or state air quality datasets collected from crematoria measuring volatile organic compounds (VOCs), metals, or synthetics not normally associated with standard cremation emissions (e.g., mercury from dental amalgam, plastics, foams, embalming chemicals)
	•	Internal analyses, laboratory reports, or vendor contracts describing the presence of unusual alloys, ceramics, composites, or nano-structured materials in crematory exhaust streams
	•	Interagency communications between EPA, HHS, VA, or DoD regarding crematory emissions as a potential occupational hazard for workers exposed to atypical materials during cremation of service members or civilians
	•	Any briefing papers, risk assessments, or technical memoranda discussing cremation emissions in connection with implanted devices, novel biomedical materials, or research prototypes
	•	Reports from NIH- or VA-affiliated researchers monitoring whether medical devices, implants, or prosthetics contribute measurable anomalous emissions profiles during cremation

Keywords: crematory emissions, novel materials, biomedical implants, ceramic composites, nano-structured materials, emissions monitoring, occupational hazard, EPA air toxics, VA mortuary affairs, atypical cremation residues

To Department of Defense (DoD, incl. Mortuary Affairs, DARPA, and Defense Health Agency) / Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) / Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) / Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) / National Institutes of Health (NIH)

Request:

Requesting any and all monitoring reports, emissions testing data, contractor deliverables, internal memoranda, or interagency communications from January 1, 2000 to present concerning crematory emissions linked to the incineration of biomedical implants, experimental neurotechnology, or classified research devices.

This includes:
	•	EPA or DoD air quality reports documenting novel metals, alloys, ceramics, composites, or nanomaterials released during cremation of individuals with medical or experimental implants
	•	Laboratory analyses of crematory exhaust streams containing residues from neuromodulation hardware, neural interfaces, biosensors, or microelectronics
	•	DoD/VA communications regarding safe disposal of service members or research subjects with implanted neurotechnology through cremation
	•	Contractor statements of work or technical memoranda describing cremation as a disposal method for classified biomedical devices or neurotech prototypes
	•	Internal risk assessments addressing toxic byproducts, emissions signatures, or occupational hazards when cremating individuals with neurotechnology or advanced implantable materials
	•	Interagency discussions (DoD, VA, HHS, EPA, NIH) about whether cremation emissions may inadvertently expose the presence of novel or classified materials

Keywords: cremation emissions, neurotechnology, neural implants, biosensors, classified biomedical devices, DARPA, Mortuary Affairs, nanomaterials, emissions monitoring, toxic byproducts, experimental hardware

Request:

Requesting any and all contracts, research proposals, clinical trial data, interagency communications, or technical memoranda from January 1, 1990 to present concerning Houston-based cardiac surgery centers — specifically the Texas Heart Institute (St. Luke’s), the DeBakey Heart & Vascular Center (Houston Methodist), and affiliated Texas Medical Center institutions — in relation to implantable medical device telemetry, neuromodulation, or crossover into neurotechnology applications.

This includes:
	•	Contracts, Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs), and grants involving DARPA, NIH, or VA in which pacemakers, defibrillators, LVADs, or artificial hearts were studied for telemetry, wireless control, or closed-loop modulation capabilities
	•	Clinical trial protocols, adverse event reports, or IRB submissions at Texas Heart Institute or Houston Methodist referencing neural monitoring, autonomic nervous system interactions, or crossover to neurostimulation platforms
	•	FDA CDRH/CBER communications with Houston-based investigators or manufacturers concerning device firmware, remote telemetry, cybersecurity, or adaptive algorithms in implantable devices
	•	Deliverables, dashboards, or white papers analyzing Houston cardiac patient cohorts as predictive models for compliance, follow-up behavior, or resilience under implant-mediated control
	•	Internal DoD or VA memoranda discussing the use of Houston cardiac centers as partner sites for transitioning cardiac implant technologies to neurotech prototypes (e.g., deep brain stimulators, spinal cord stimulators, cortical interfaces)
	•	Briefings or contractor deliverables that describe cardiac implant telemetry as a gateway platform for broader implantable biosensor/neurotech integration

Keywords: Texas Heart Institute, DeBakey Heart Center, Houston Methodist, implant telemetry, neuromodulation, pacemaker, LVAD, DARPA neurotech, VA implant monitoring, firmware updates, predictive compliance, cardiac-neural interface
