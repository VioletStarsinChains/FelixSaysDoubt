Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, contracts, or internal communications concerning the use of Antarctica and its research stations as sites for experimental continuity theater, neurotechnology trials, or covert environmental signal studies, from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Reports on the use of Antarctica’s low-noise environment for ELF/VLF communication, entrainment, or neurotechnology-related signal testing
	•	Studies on the psychological and physiological effects of long-term isolation in Antarctic bases as controlled environments for resilience or behavioral research
	•	Research into Antarctic soundscapes (wind, seals, penguins, auroral emissions) as masking layers for covert acoustic or electromagnetic signals
	•	Contracts with private or academic institutions for bioprospecting, cryobiology, or immune-modulation studies on Antarctic extremophiles
	•	Internal communications regarding the use of Antarctica’s “pristine wilderness” narrative as cultural continuity theater to obscure experimental or extractive activities
	•	Risk assessments or ethical reviews of entrainment, biosensing, or population-level exposure trials conducted under the cover of Antarctic science programs

Keywords: Antarctica, McMurdo Station, South Pole Station, ELF/VLF communication, continuity theater, neurotechnology trials, acoustic masking, isolation psychology, cryobiology, bioprospecting, NSF research

To National Science Foundation (NSF) / NIH / Department of Defense / DARPA

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, contracts, or internal communications concerning the neurological and physiological effects of snow glare, ice reflectivity, and prolonged visual exposure in Antarctic environments, from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Studies on the impact of high-reflectivity snow and ice on circadian rhythm, cognitive performance, and nervous system regulation in Antarctic personnel
	•	Research on snow-induced Ganzfeld effects, perceptual disorientation, or altered states of consciousness
	•	Reports on the interaction of extreme light conditions with neuroinflammation, immune modulation, or psychological stress in overwintering crews
	•	Contracts with private or academic partners investigating the use of Antarctic light environments for entrainment, masking, or continuity theater applications
	•	Ethical reviews or risk assessments concerning prolonged human exposure to high-UV snow glare in Antarctic research stations

Keywords: Antarctica, snow glare, ice reflectivity, Ganzfeld effect, circadian disruption, visual entrainment, continuity theater, overwintering crews, neuroinflammation, NSF polar research
