Request:

Requesting any and all reports, studies, complaints, or interagency communications from January 1, 2000 to present concerning infrasound, low-frequency sound, or vibration-based entrainment methods in factory, warehouse, or industrial manufacturing settings.

This includes:
	•	Occupational health and safety assessments documenting physiological or behavioral effects of infrasound or low-frequency exposure in workers
	•	Research proposals or internal studies on entrainment effects of low-frequency sound in controlled industrial environments
	•	Records of worker complaints or union grievances citing incapacitation, disorientation, or stress symptoms associated with infrasound in factories or warehouses
	•	Enforcement actions, inspections, or hazard citations related to sound/vibration exposure in industrial facilities
	•	Communications between OSHA, NIOSH, EPA, and private sector partners regarding the deployment of infrasound or vibration-modulating infrastructure in factory settings
	•	Interagency analyses of potential compliance, productivity, or behavioral impacts of low-frequency sound exposure in occupational environments

Keywords: infrasound hazard, low-frequency sound exposure, factory entrainment, worker compliance testing, occupational acoustics, vibration stress, NIOSH studies, OSHA enforcement, industrial noise modeling, EPA research

Request:

Requesting any and all reports, studies, communications, or enforcement actions from January 1, 2000 to present concerning the transfer or adaptation of infrasound and low-frequency sound research from factory or industrial environments into public-facing consumer, retail, wellness, or athletic recovery facilities.

This includes:
	•	Records tracing occupational acoustics or vibration research conducted in factory/warehouse contexts into applications in therapeutic or recreational environments
	•	Contracts, grants, or research proposals involving OSHA, NIOSH, or EPA collaborating with private sector vendors on low-frequency sound exposure outside traditional workplace settings
	•	Enforcement actions or consumer complaints citing incapacitation, disorientation, or behavioral stress effects in gyms, cryotherapy clinics, wellness centers, or retail spaces with infrasound infrastructure
	•	Communications between state or federal occupational safety agencies and consumer protection regulators (FTC, MDH) on cross-over risks between industrial acoustics and consumer exposure
	•	Analyses of whether entrainment effects, compliance behaviors, or productivity models from factories were considered transferable to civilian populations in public spaces
	•	Documentation of public health risk assessments comparing worker vs. consumer thresholds for infrasound and low-frequency sound tolerance

Keywords: infrasound crossover, low-frequency sound, factory to retail adaptation, occupational acoustics, wellness clinic exposure, consumer safety, cryotherapy environments, entrainment transfer, compliance modeling, behavioral stress testing

Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, research proposals, or interagency communications from January 1, 2000 to present concerning the adaptation of infrasound or low-frequency sound technologies originally developed for military or battlefield purposes into industrial, occupational, wellness, or consumer-facing environments.

This includes:
	•	Research or pilot programs on infrasound as a non-lethal deterrent, compliance anchor, or behavioral entrainment tool
	•	Contracts or communications involving DoD, DARPA, ARL, or ONR with private sector partners adapting battlefield acoustics research to factory, retail, or therapeutic settings
	•	Reports or analyses of physiological and behavioral responses to infrasound exposure in civilian populations compared to military subjects
	•	Records referencing the transfer of infrasound/vibration technologies into cryotherapy clinics, gyms, wellness centers, or other consumer-facing businesses
	•	Interagency discussions of liability, ethics, or risk assessments when deploying military-developed acoustic technologies in commercial civilian contexts
	•	Documentation of coordination with HHS or public health agencies regarding non-lethal acoustic exposure outside of defense applications

Keywords: infrasound military adaptation, low-frequency sound crossover, non-lethal deterrent, DARPA acoustics, compliance anchor, behavioral entrainment, civilian deployment, cryotherapy crossover, industrial to retail transfer, DHS oversight
