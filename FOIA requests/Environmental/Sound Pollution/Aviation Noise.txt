Request:

Requesting any and all studies, reports, communications, or contracts from January 1, 2000 to present concerning the use of aircraft overflight patterns, low-frequency aviation noise, or related acoustic emissions as potential vectors for physiological stress testing, entrainment, or behavioral compliance modeling in civilian residential populations.

This includes:
	•	FAA or NASA-funded research into the long-term effects of repeated low-frequency aircraft noise exposure on cognition, stress, or compliance behaviors
	•	Interagency discussions of overflight corridors and their suitability for studying chronic exposure effects on civilian populations
	•	Records of collaborations with DoD or other federal agencies on using aircraft noise as a non-lethal deterrent, entrainment mechanism, or predictive behavioral stressor
	•	Environmental impact statements or noise abatement program records that include behavioral or compliance-related outcome measures
	•	Consumer complaints, public health assessments, or community surveys documenting incapacitation, agitation, or stress responses correlated with aircraft noise exposure
	•	Contracts or partnerships with private-sector vendors modeling aircraft noise exposure as a factor in predictive behavioral analytics

Keywords: aircraft noise, aviation infrasound, overflight stress testing, civilian entrainment, compliance modeling, FAA noise abatement, NASA acoustics, predictive behavior research, low-frequency exposure, DoD non-lethal acoustics

• U.S. Department of State (Bureau of International Organization Affairs)

Request:

Requesting any and all reports, studies, communications, or agreements from January 1, 2000 to present concerning the health, behavioral, or entrainment impacts of chronic aircraft overflight noise and low-frequency aviation exposure on civilian residential populations. Particular emphasis is requested on cross-border or international coordination of such research.

This includes:
	•	WHO guidelines, working papers, or collaborations on aircraft noise as a determinant of health, including cognitive, cardiovascular, or behavioral effects
	•	ICAO or EASA records on low-frequency sound exposure, entrainment risk, or compliance modeling linked to civilian overflight corridors
	•	NATO Human Factors and Medicine panel studies on acoustic stressors or non-lethal sound applications, and their potential civilian crossover
	•	U.S. State Department communications with WHO, ICAO, or NATO concerning research coordination on aviation noise and behavioral outcomes
	•	International memoranda of understanding (MOUs) or contracts involving predictive modeling of compliance or stress response from repeated aircraft exposure
	•	Reports assessing noise abatement policies not only for decibel reduction but also for behavioral or entrainment outcomes in affected populations

Keywords: aircraft noise health, aviation infrasound, WHO noise guidelines, NATO acoustic research, ICAO overflight, EU aviation safety, behavioral entrainment, civilian exposure, predictive modeling, international coordination
