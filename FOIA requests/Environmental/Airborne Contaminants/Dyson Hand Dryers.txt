Request:

Requesting any and all documents, inspection reports, laboratory test results, internal communications, or vendor contracts concerning the use of commercial hand dryers (including but not limited to Dyson Airblade models) that advertise HEPA filtration, from 2000 to present.

This includes:
	•	Records of air quality testing in restrooms or other facilities where Dyson or comparable hand dryers are installed, specifically measuring airborne particles, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), or microbiological dispersal from dryers
	•	Incident reports, consumer complaints, or OSHA workplace safety investigations involving potential health effects of exposure to particles emitted by commercial hand dryers
	•	Internal communications or policy documents discussing whether HEPA-classified dryer filters function as dispersal devices rather than filtration devices
	•	Laboratory studies or third-party contractor reports commissioned by FDA, EPA, or OSHA on the efficacy and safety of Dyson hand dryers and similar devices in public or institutional settings
	•	Contracts, correspondence, or communications with manufacturers (Dyson, Excel Dryer, etc.) regarding HEPA certification, testing protocols, or chemical/particle dispersal concerns
	•	Interagency memoranda on standards or enforcement policies related to air dispersal from HEPA-advertised commercial hand dryers
