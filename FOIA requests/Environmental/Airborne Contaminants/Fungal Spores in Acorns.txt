Request:

Requesting any and all records, internal communications, contracts, or research proposals regarding the impact of wildfires and oak-associated ecosystems on fungal spore dispersal and human or agricultural health, from 2000 to present.

This includes:
	•	Studies or surveillance programs tracking fungal pathogens in wildfire smoke (Aspergillus, Coccidioides, Histoplasma, Cryptococcus) and their potential to cause post-fire respiratory illness
	•	Research on pyrophilous fungi (Morchella, Pyronema, and related genera) in connection with soil conductivity, spore ecology, or altered exposure pathways
	•	Reports on acorns and oak products (food, feed, craft materials) as vectors of fungal spores, including endophytic fungi (Aspergillus, Penicillium, Fusarium, Alternaria)
	•	Risk assessments on aflatoxins or mycotoxins produced by acorn-associated fungi and their entry into human or animal food chains
	•	Documentation of wildlife-mediated dispersal (squirrels, jays, etc.) of acorn-associated fungi into residential or agricultural environments
	•	Oversight or contractor projects linking wildfire recovery, oak ecosystems, and fungal hazards to continuity-of-operations or public health resilience planning

Keywords: wildfire smoke, fungal spores, acorns, oak ecosystems, Aspergillus, Penicillium, Fusarium, Alternaria, Morchella, Pyronema, aflatoxin, mycotoxin, endophytic fungi, post-fire ecology, respiratory illness, wildlife dispersal
