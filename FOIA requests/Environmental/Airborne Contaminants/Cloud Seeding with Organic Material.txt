Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, laboratory analyses, interagency communications, or oversight reports from 1990 to present concerning the use of nontraditional or organic-derived particulates in cloud seeding and weather modification programs.

This includes:
	•	Records describing or authorizing the use of bone ash, cremated remains, keratin fibers, or other organic-derived particles as alternatives or supplements to conventional cloud seeding materials (such as silver iodide, salt, or dry ice).
	•	Laboratory analyses or atmospheric studies evaluating the effectiveness of organic particulates (including calcium phosphate or protein-based aerosols) as condensation nuclei in weather modification.
	•	Oversight reviews or risk assessments discussing health, environmental, or ethical considerations of deploying organic-derived materials into the atmosphere for weather modification.
	•	Communications between NOAA, USAF, DOE, or affiliated contractors regarding experiments, field trials, or modeling of organic particulates in cloud seeding.
	•	Contractor deliverables or interagency reports evaluating whether organic remains or bio-derived powders could substitute for conventional cloud seeding agents in cost, performance, or availability.

Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, laboratory analyses, interagency communications, or oversight reports from 1990 to present concerning the use of nontraditional or organic-derived particulates in cloud seeding, weather modification, or precipitation enhancement projects conducted within [State].

This includes:
	•	Records describing or authorizing the use of bone ash, cremated remains, keratin fibers, or other organic-derived particles as seeding agents.
	•	Laboratory testing or field studies assessing the effectiveness of organic particulates (e.g., calcium phosphate, protein aerosols) as condensation nuclei.
	•	Contracts with contractors, universities, or water resource districts implementing cloud seeding involving organic-derived materials.
	•	Oversight reviews, environmental or public health risk assessments, or ethics panels addressing the deployment of organic particulates for atmospheric modification.
	•	Communications between state agencies and federal counterparts (NOAA, DOE, USAF) regarding joint projects or shared data on organic materials in weather modification.
