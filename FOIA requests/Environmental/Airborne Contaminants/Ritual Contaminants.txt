Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, research proposals, interagency communications, or vendor agreements from 2000 to present concerning the safety, chemical composition, and potential contaminants in consumer products used for celebration or ritual that release airborne particulates, including colored powders (e.g., gender reveal products), candles, and incense.

This includes:
	•	Studies on chemical emissions (soot, volatile organic compounds, metallic salts, synthetic dyes, microplastics) from celebratory powders, candles, or incense
	•	Reports on contaminants or toxicological risks associated with inhalation or long-term exposure to these consumer products
	•	Contracts or cooperative agreements with manufacturers or distributors for product safety testing or certification
	•	Interagency communications regarding consumer exposure risks, fire hazards, and indoor/outdoor air quality impacts of these products
	•	Guidance documents or policy reviews related to the safe use of celebratory or ritual airborne products in homes or public gatherings

Keywords: consumer product safety, colored powder, candle emissions, incense smoke, chemical contaminants, inhalation risk, VOCs, CPSC, FDA, NIST, EPA

Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, research proposals, interagency communications, vendor agreements, or policy assessments from 2000 to present concerning the use of colored powders (e.g., gender reveal products), candles, or incense as airborne entrainment tools in the context of behavioral modeling, predictive analytics, or behavioral futures markets.

This includes:
	•	Research on the use of airborne pigments, scented smoke, or ritual flame as compliance anchors in collective environments (e.g., family gatherings, celebrations, religious/spiritual contexts)
	•	Pilot programs or studies evaluating behavioral responses (arousal, loyalty, compliance, volatility) triggered by exposure to ritualized powders, candle emissions, or incense smoke
	•	Analyses of how gender reveal events, candle-lighting rituals, or incense burning serve as group entrainment mechanisms linking identity formation to consumer products
	•	Interagency or contractor communications concerning the integration of airborne entrainment products with behavioral telemetry datasets (e.g., crowd observation, purchase tracking, stress physiology)
	•	Contracts with consumer product manufacturers, fragrance companies, or distributors for deployment of entrainment-capable products in public-facing celebrations or rituals
	•	Ethical reviews or policy assessments regarding covert use of celebratory or ritual products as behavioral conditioning tools or airborne exposure vectors
	•	Correlation studies linking the spread of ritual product use to datasets on compliance, spending behavior, or social polarization

Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, research proposals, interagency communications, or vendor agreements from 2000 to present concerning the safety, chemical composition, and potential contaminants in consumer smudge bundles and ritual woods, including but not limited to sage, mugwort, cedar, and palo santo.

This includes:
	•	Toxicological studies or reports on volatile organic compounds, allergens, or particulate matter released by burning smudge bundles or ritual woods
	•	Research on contaminants such as pesticides, heavy metals, or adulterants in consumer-grade smudge products
	•	Contracts or cooperative agreements with vendors, distributors, or importers for safety testing or certification of smudge bundles and ritual woods
	•	Guidance documents or advisories concerning health risks of consumer exposure to smudge smoke, particularly in enclosed or family environments
	•	Interagency communications regarding consumer complaints, adverse reactions, or environmental impacts associated with smudge bundle or palo santo use

Keywords: smudge bundle, sage, mugwort, palo santo, ritual wood, chemical contaminants, VOC emissions, consumer product safety, CPSC, NIH, FDA, NIST, EPA

Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, research proposals, interagency communications, vendor agreements, or policy discussions from 2000 to present concerning the use of smudge bundles (e.g., sage, mugwort, cedar) and ritual woods (e.g., palo santo) as airborne entrainment tools in the context of behavioral modeling, predictive analytics, or behavioral futures markets.

This includes:
	•	Research on how ritual smoke exposure influences neuroimmune activity, arousal, or compliance in individuals and groups
	•	Pilot programs assessing smudge ceremonies or palo santo rituals as group entrainment events, measuring synchronization, attention capture, or susceptibility to narrative framing
	•	Analyses of adverse reactions (e.g., asthma, immune flares, neurological sensitivity) as indicators of population volatility or resistance
	•	Interagency communications regarding the distribution of ritual smoke products through retail and wellness markets as covert behavioral probes
	•	Contracts with fragrance companies, importers, or wellness product distributors for integration of ritual woods or herbs into entrainment-focused experiments
	•	Ethical reviews or policy assessments concerning the covert use of traditional or ritual products as compliance anchors, stress modulators, or airborne telemetry vectors
	•	Correlation studies linking ritual product use (smudge bundles, palo santo) to datasets on consumer loyalty, group identity formation, or susceptibility to ritualized narratives

Keywords: smudge bundle, palo santo, mugwort, ritual smoke, entrainment tool, compliance anchor, behavioral futures markets, neuroimmune modulation, DARPA, IARPA
