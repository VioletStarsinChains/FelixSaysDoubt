To: EPA / Office of Research and Development (ORD) / National Homeland Security Research Center
CC: Department of Homeland Security (DHS) / Science & Technology Directorate

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, internal communications, or contractor deliverables from 2000–present relating to the use of domestic infrastructure as aerosolization vectors, specifically:
	•	Laundry machines and dryer vent systems as potential dispersal pathways for chemical, biological, or behavioral agents
	•	Studies on microfiber, detergent, or additive release into air via residential dryer exhaust
	•	Risk analyses of municipal water supply contaminants becoming airborne through washing/drying cycles
	•	Pilot projects or demonstrations involving surrogate tracers in dryer vent exhaust or HVAC-linked laundry facilities
	•	Communications with defense contractors, universities, or municipal utilities regarding laundry-related aerosolization

Keywords: dryer vent aerosolization, technical water, domestic dispersal, microfiber entrainment, laundry emissions, household infrastructure pilot, surrogate tracer study, airborne contaminants, behavioral aerosol vectors, localized attrition

Request:

Pursuant to the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act, requesting any and all records from 2000–present concerning laundry infrastructure as potential aerosolization vectors, including:
	•	Research, pilot projects, or grants studying microfiber, detergent, or chemical release from household or multifamily dryer vent exhaust
	•	Records regarding municipal water additives or contaminants becoming airborne through washing/drying cycles
	•	Communications between MPCA/MDH and municipal water utilities concerning dryer vent emissions, air quality impacts, or surrogate tracer studies
	•	Any cooperative projects with universities, federal agencies, or private contractors on household-scale aerosolization pathways

Keywords: dryer vent emissions, aerosolization vectors, technical water, microfiber entrainment, laundry exhaust, domestic dispersal pilot, surrogate tracer study, airborne contaminants, localized attrition
