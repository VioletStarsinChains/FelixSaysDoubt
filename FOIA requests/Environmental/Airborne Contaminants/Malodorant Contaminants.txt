Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, contracts, or internal communications concerning the use of airborne malodorants (including indole, skatole, and related nitrogen-containing volatiles) and masking volatiles (including corn-derived compounds such as pyrazines and aldehydes) in commercial food service or retail environments, from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Studies on the behavioral or neurological effects of subthreshold malodorant exposure in food retail environments

	•	Internal communications regarding risk assessments or ethical reviews of exposing the public to malodorant/masking blends in restaurants, cafés, or other enclosed public spaces
	•	Reports on use of odorants for dual purposes, including crowd control or attrition modeling, with food environments as cover or test beds
