To: Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) / Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

Request:
Requesting any and all documents, testing records, internal communications, or incident reports related to the chemical composition, manufacturing standards, and potential airborne contaminants present in plastic “air pillow” shipping inserts used in consumer packaging, from 2000 to present.

This includes:
	•	Testing protocols for air quality inside packaging air cushions.
	•	Records of contaminants, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), or other byproducts detected in shipped air packets.
	•	Risk assessments of inhalation exposure when such air pillows are punctured or deflated in home environments.
	•	Communications with major distributors (Amazon, UPS, FedEx, etc.) regarding the safety of packaging air.
	•	Supplier certifications or audits of facilities producing air cushion packaging.

Request:
Requesting any and all documents, contracts, communications, or research related to the use of plastic “air pillow” shipping inserts as potential vectors for airborne entrainment agents, compliance testing, or environmental biosurveillance, from 2000 to present.

This includes:
	•	Research into using air-filled packaging materials to distribute aerosolized compounds, nanomaterials, or volatile agents upon puncture.
	•	Risk-benefit assessments of piggybacking behavioral or biometric experiments on e-commerce supply chains via packaging materials.
	•	Studies on consumer inhalation exposure, immune system response, or compliance modulation when interacting with air pillow packaging.
	•	Internal communications or contractor deliverables linking air pillow packaging to behavioral futures markets, including entrainment or volatility-inducing compounds.
	•	Surveillance programs testing packaging as a site-specific marker for identifying or tracking consumers through controlled exposure.
