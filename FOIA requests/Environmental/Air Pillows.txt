To: Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) / Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

Request:
Requesting any and all documents, testing records, internal communications, or incident reports related to the chemical composition, manufacturing standards, and potential airborne contaminants present in plastic “air pillow” shipping inserts used in consumer packaging, from 2000 to present.

This includes:
	•	Testing protocols for air quality inside packaging air cushions.
	•	Records of contaminants, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), or other byproducts detected in shipped air packets.
	•	Risk assessments of inhalation exposure when such air pillows are punctured or deflated in home environments.
	•	Communications with major distributors (Amazon, UPS, FedEx, etc.) regarding the safety of packaging air.
	•	Supplier certifications or audits of facilities producing air cushion packaging.

Keywords: packaging air pillow, shipping air packets, VOC, consumer safety, inhalation risk, air contamination, packaging inserts, CPSC, EPA

Request:
Requesting any and all documents, contracts, communications, or research related to the use of plastic “air pillow” shipping inserts as potential vectors for airborne entrainment agents, compliance testing, or environmental biosurveillance, from 2000 to present.

This includes:
	•	Research into using air-filled packaging materials to distribute aerosolized compounds, nanomaterials, or volatile agents upon puncture.
	•	Risk-benefit assessments of piggybacking behavioral or biometric experiments on e-commerce supply chains via packaging materials.
	•	Studies on consumer inhalation exposure, immune system response, or compliance modulation when interacting with air pillow packaging.
	•	Internal communications or contractor deliverables linking air pillow packaging to behavioral futures markets, including entrainment or volatility-inducing compounds.
	•	Surveillance programs testing packaging as a site-specific marker for identifying or tracking consumers through controlled exposure.

To: Department of Homeland Security (DHS) / Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) / Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, safety assessments, internal communications, incident reports, or contractor research regarding the use of air-filled packaging materials (commonly referred to as “air pillows”) as potential vectors for environmental contamination or centralized facility hazards, from 2000 to present.

This includes:
	•	Records discussing the possibility of oxygen-enriched air or other combustion-accelerant gases being used in packaging materials
	•	Risk assessments on flammable or reactive gases (e.g., methane, hydrogen, acetylene, propane) in large quantities of air pillows stored in centralized warehouse facilities
	•	Analysis of how such packaging could contribute to accelerated fire spread or explosive hazard conditions in fulfillment centers or distribution hubs
	•	Contractor or vendor specifications for gas composition and quality standards in air-filled packaging
	•	Communications addressing the potential for dual-use of packaging (both as protective material and as a covert vector for sabotage, hazard creation, or behavioral compliance leverage)
	•	Incident reports where packaging materials were found to contain contaminants, oxidizers, or reactive substances other than ambient atmospheric air

Keywords: air pillows, packaging gas composition, oxygen-enriched, combustion accelerant, flammable gases, Amazon warehouse safety, distribution center hazard, environmental sabotage, compliance risk, dual-use packaging
