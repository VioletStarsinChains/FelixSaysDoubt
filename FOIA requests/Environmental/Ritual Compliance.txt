Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, research proposals, interagency communications, or vendor agreements from 2000 to present concerning the safety, chemical composition, and potential contaminants in consumer products used for celebration or ritual that release airborne particulates, including colored powders (e.g., gender reveal products), candles, and incense.

This includes:
	•	Studies on chemical emissions (soot, volatile organic compounds, metallic salts, synthetic dyes, microplastics) from celebratory powders, candles, or incense
	•	Reports on contaminants or toxicological risks associated with inhalation or long-term exposure to these consumer products
	•	Contracts or cooperative agreements with manufacturers or distributors for product safety testing or certification
	•	Interagency communications regarding consumer exposure risks, fire hazards, and indoor/outdoor air quality impacts of these products
	•	Guidance documents or policy reviews related to the safe use of celebratory or ritual airborne products in homes or public gatherings

Keywords: consumer product safety, colored powder, candle emissions, incense smoke, chemical contaminants, inhalation risk, VOCs, CPSC, FDA, NIST, EPA

To: DARPA / Biological Technologies Office; DARPA / Information Innovation Office; IARPA; DHS / Office of Intelligence & Analysis; HHS / NIH; EPA; CPSC

Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, research proposals, interagency communications, vendor agreements, or policy assessments from 2000 to present concerning the use of colored powders (e.g., gender reveal products), candles, or incense as airborne entrainment tools in the context of behavioral modeling, predictive analytics, or behavioral futures markets.

This includes:
	•	Research on the use of airborne pigments, scented smoke, or ritual flame as compliance anchors in collective environments (e.g., family gatherings, celebrations, religious/spiritual contexts)
	•	Pilot programs or studies evaluating behavioral responses (arousal, loyalty, compliance, volatility) triggered by exposure to ritualized powders, candle emissions, or incense smoke
	•	Analyses of how gender reveal events, candle-lighting rituals, or incense burning serve as group entrainment mechanisms linking identity formation to consumer products
	•	Interagency or contractor communications concerning the integration of airborne entrainment products with behavioral telemetry datasets (e.g., crowd observation, purchase tracking, stress physiology)
	•	Contracts with consumer product manufacturers, fragrance companies, or distributors for deployment of entrainment-capable products in public-facing celebrations or rituals
	•	Ethical reviews or policy assessments regarding covert use of celebratory or ritual products as behavioral conditioning tools or airborne exposure vectors
	•	Correlation studies linking the spread of ritual product use to datasets on compliance, spending behavior, or social polarization
