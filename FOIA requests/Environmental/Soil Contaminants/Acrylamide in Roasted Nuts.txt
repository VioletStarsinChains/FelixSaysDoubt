Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, communications, laboratory analyses, inspection reports, or investigative files from January 1, 2000 to present concerning acrylamide content in roasted nut products (including but not limited to almonds, hazelnuts, pistachios, peanuts, cashews, and macadamias), and the potential persistence, mobility, or environmental impact of acrylamide and related roasting byproducts through waste or compost streams.

This includes:
	•	Laboratory testing results for acrylamide in commercially roasted nuts under varying roasting conditions (temperature, time, moisture) and product forms (whole, chopped, flavored, coated)
	•	Reports, studies, or pilot projects evaluating acrylamide formation kinetics in nuts and co-occurrence with other Maillard byproducts
	•	Waste stream analysis of roasted nut byproducts (shells, expired stock, manufacturing waste) entering compost, animal feed, or municipal waste systems, including measurements of acrylamide persistence and soil/water migration
	•	Contracts, statements of work, or task orders involving federal agencies or contractors (including Palantir Technologies, Accenture Federal Services, Deloitte, Booz Allen Hamilton) for tracking or modeling acrylamide mobility from nut waste into environmental systems
	•	Records of targeted or geofenced distribution of roasted nut products for dietary, environmental, or behavioral research purposes
	•	Microbiome and pathogen studies analyzing the effect of roasted nut waste, shells, or coatings on soil bacterial/fungal composition and greenhouse gas emissions from amended soils
	•	Any records evaluating the contribution of acrylamide from roasted nut waste to greenhouse gas emissions, reactive nitrogen cycling, or soil carbon sequestration capacity, including intentional or strategic acceleration scenarios
