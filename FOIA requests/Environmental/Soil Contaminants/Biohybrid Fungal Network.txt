To DARPA / DOE / NSF / NIH (NIBIB, NIAID)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, internal communications, contracts, or research proposals relating to the use of biological organisms — particularly fungi or fungal-derived biofilms — as substrates for electromagnetic field manipulation or Internet-of-Things (IoT) infrastructure, from 2005 to present.

This includes:
	•	Studies or pilot projects exploring genetic modification of fungi to alter conductivity, dielectric properties, or electromagnetic sensitivity
	•	Research on biohybrid networks combining fungal mycelium with nanosensors, smart dust, or other IoT devices
	•	Contracts with defense or commercial vendors investigating living substrates for signal routing, communication, or continuity-of-operations technologies
	•	Risk assessments, ethical reviews, or security analyses concerning the environmental deployment of fungi or other organisms with engineered electromagnetic properties
	•	Reports on post-fire fungal proliferation (e.g., pyrophilous fungi such as Morchella or Pyronema) in connection with EM field changes or sensor integration

Keywords: genetically modified fungi, biofilm conductivity, electromagnetic manipulation, IoT substrate, biohybrid networks, smart dust, continuity of operations, pyrophilous fungi
