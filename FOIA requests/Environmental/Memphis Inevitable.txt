Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, contracts, experimental plans, after-action reports, interagency communications, risk assessments, procurement records, and policy memoranda from January 1, 1980 to present concerning seismic modulation, earthquake preparedness exercises, and population-level behavioral modeling in the New Madrid Seismic Zone (NMSZ), including the Memphis metropolitan area.

This includes:
	•	Research on ionospheric heating, ELF/VLF transmissions, or RF energy injection and their potential coupling to tectonic stress release, microseismic activity, or induced earthquakes in the New Madrid fault system
	•	Contracts, SOWs, or deliverables involving AFRL, DARPA, NRL, or academic/contractor partners studying tectonic stress modulation, plasma-lithosphere interactions, or “tectonic weapons” concepts
	•	After-action reports, planning documents, and public communication strategies from FEMA catastrophic earthquake exercises (e.g., NLE 2011, CAPSTONE-14, New Madrid Seismic Zone Catastrophic Planning Initiative) focused on Memphis and surrounding areas
	•	Internal communications describing earthquake drills or predictions as “compliance rehearsals,” “resilience modeling,” or “anticipatory entrainment” of Memphis/NMSZ populations
	•	Data collected from evacuation drills, panic management efforts, or emergency mass-care simulations in Memphis and nearby regions, including communications about predictive analytics, compliance rates, or demographic segmentation
	•	Spectrum authorizations, FCC experimental licenses, or coordination records for high-power RF/ELF transmissions coinciding with seismic monitoring campaigns in the Mid-South region
	•	Interagency correspondence with USGS or NOAA concerning whether unusual seismic swarms or anomalies may be associated with ionospheric/atmospheric experiments
	•	Epidemiological or sociological reports examining the psychological and behavioral effects of repeated public messaging that Memphis is “overdue” for an earthquake

Keywords: Memphis, New Madrid Seismic Zone, ELF/VLF, ionospheric heating, tectonic stress release, induced seismicity, earthquake preparedness, FEMA NLE 2011, CAPSTONE-14, compliance rehearsal, resilience modeling, anticipatory entrainment, AFRL/DARPA
