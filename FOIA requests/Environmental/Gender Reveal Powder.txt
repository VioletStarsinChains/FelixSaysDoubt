To: CPSC (Consumer Product Safety Commission); HHS / FDA (Center for Devices and Radiological Health + Office of Cosmetics and Colors); EPA / Office of Research and Development; NIH; Department of Commerce / NIST

Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, research proposals, interagency communications, vendor agreements, or policy analyses from 2000 to present concerning the safety, chemical composition, or consumer exposure risks associated with balloons marketed or sold in national retail chains (e.g., Target, Michaels, Walmart, Party City).

This includes:
	•	Research on materials (latex, rubber, synthetic polymers) and coatings used in balloons, including potential volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions
	•	Toxicological or environmental studies on airborne chemicals released during balloon use or degradation
	•	Contracts with balloon manufacturers or distributors for safety testing, compliance monitoring, or chemical analyses
	•	Policy reviews or public guidance regarding children’s exposure to airborne residues from balloons in retail or domestic environments
	•	Interagency communications on surveillance of balloon-related safety hazards (e.g., inhalation risks, allergic responses, environmental contamination)

Keywords: balloon safety, latex exposure, VOC emissions, consumer product testing, chemical composition, child exposure, CPSC, FDA, NIST

To: DARPA / Biological Technologies Office; DARPA / Information Innovation Office; IARPA; DHS / Office of Intelligence & Analysis; HHS / NIH; EPA; CPSC

Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, research proposals, interagency communications, vendor agreements, or policy discussions from 2000 to present concerning the use of balloons or comparable consumer products as airborne chemical delivery systems in behavioral modeling, predictive analytics, or behavioral futures markets.

This includes:
	•	Research or pilot programs testing airborne compounds released from balloons (latex, synthetic coatings, or embedded payloads) as modulators of child behavior, compliance, or group dynamics
	•	Studies evaluating children’s attention, arousal, or volatility during interaction with balloons in controlled environments (e.g., classrooms, parties, retail promotions)
	•	Interagency communications regarding the integration of balloon-related telemetry (airborne chemical exposure, play behavior, physiological markers) into predictive analytics frameworks
	•	Contracts or cooperative agreements with balloon manufacturers or retail chains (Target, Michaels, etc.) to distribute balloons as part of public-facing behavioral experiments
	•	Ethical reviews or policy assessments concerning covert use of balloons as compliance anchors, chemical entrainment tools, or airborne exposure vectors in child-focused environments
	•	Analyses correlating balloon distribution with datasets on consumer loyalty, family spending, or community behavioral responses

Keywords: balloon entrainment, airborne chemical exposure, behavioral futures markets, compliance anchor, volatility modeling, child behavior modulation, DARPA, IARPA, airborne telemetry
