To: Environmental Protection Agency / Office of Research and Development

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, research proposals, or internal communications generated during the tenure of 1977-2017 regarding the use of environmental datasets for predictive modeling of human behavior.

This includes:
	•	Reports or proposals linking air, water, or soil quality metrics to behavioral or cognitive outcomes in nearby populations
	•	Communications with defense or intelligence agencies regarding “synthetic ecology” or environmental simulations used to anticipate social stability
	•	Vendor contracts describing integration of EPA data streams into broader compliance or public health prediction frameworks
	•	Risk/benefit assessments of sharing environmental monitoring data with agencies outside EPA for purposes beyond environmental regulation

Keywords: synthetic ecology, predictive modeling, environmental dataset, compliance, behavioral futures, EPA-DOD cooperation, soil chemistry, water contaminants, cognitive outcomes, Stan Meiburg

To: Environmental Protection Agency / Department of Homeland Security / National Science Foundation

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, research proposals, or internal communications regarding federally funded projects at Wake Forest University’s Department of Environment and Sustainability that involve the use of ecological or environmental datasets for predictive modeling of human behavior, compliance, or community resilience, from 2010 to present.

This includes:
	•	Reports linking climate adaptation or resilience research to models of social stability or behavioral compliance
	•	Communications between Wake Forest faculty and federal agencies regarding “synthetic ecology” or ecological simulation frameworks applied to human populations
	•	Contracts or grants describing GIS- or remote sensing–based modeling of community adaptation to environmental stressors
	•	Risk/benefit assessments of using environmental curricula or sustainability research as a proxy for behavioral futures training

Keywords: Wake Forest, sustainability, community resilience, synthetic ecology, behavioral compliance, ecological modeling, GIS, remote sensing, adaptation forecasting, population stability
