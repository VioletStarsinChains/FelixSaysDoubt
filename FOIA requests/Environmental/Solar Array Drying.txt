To Department of Energy (DOE – Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy / National Renewable Energy Laboratory) / Environmental Protection Agency (EPA – Office of Research and Development / Office of Land and Emergency Management)

Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, technical reports, contracts, internal communications, or interagency memoranda concerning the use of large-scale solar panel arrays or concentrated solar facilities for organic desiccation, waste drying, or biomass decomposition management, from 2000 to present.

This includes:
	•	DOE- or NREL-funded studies evaluating solar arrays or solar thermal systems for drying organic material (agricultural waste, livestock mortalities, biosolids, or similar biomass)
	•	EPA research or contractor reports addressing environmental or public health implications of solar-powered drying of organic waste streams
	•	Internal communications or policy documents discussing potential dual-use applications of large-scale solar infrastructure for desiccation or accelerated decomposition of organic matter
	•	Records of collaborations with private solar developers or waste management firms concerning waste treatment, biomass drying, or decomposition at solar farm sites
	•	Interagency correspondence (DOE, EPA, USDA, DOD) concerning solar drying systems and their possible integration with waste disposal or emergency mortality management

Keywords: solar array, solar thermal, organic desiccation, biomass drying, waste decomposition, biosolids treatment, livestock mortality disposal, DOE, NREL, EPA
