FOIA – Insect Population Modeling & Simulation

To: U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA – Agricultural Research Service, Forest Service) / Environmental Protection Agency (EPA – Office of Research and Development) / National Science Foundation (NSF – Biological Sciences Directorate)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, contracts, research proposals, grants, reports, and interagency communications from 1990 to present concerning the creation, funding, or use of computer simulations, models, or synthetic proxies of insect populations for ecological or agricultural purposes.

This includes:
	•	Population modeling studies for bees, butterflies, beetles, or other pollinators
	•	Agent-based or computational simulations of insect colony dynamics
	•	Contracts with universities, labs, or private companies developing insect models for agricultural planning or ecological forecasting
	•	Reports on the use of insect simulations to guide conservation strategies or pesticide regulations
	•	Communications regarding discrepancies between simulated population data and observed field declines

Keywords: insect modeling, population simulation, pollinator dynamics, agent-based modeling, USDA ARS, EPA ORD, NSF biology

FOIA (Spicy Angle – Insect Simulation as Continuity Theater)

To: Department of Defense (DoD – DARPA, USAMRDC) / Department of Homeland Security (DHS – S&T, CISA) / Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, pilots, contracts, reports, or internal analyses from 1990 to present concerning the development or deployment of insect simulations (digital, robotic, or otherwise) as continuity-theater infrastructure to conceal insect population collapse.

This includes:
	•	Records on the use of robotic or AR insect constructs to sustain the appearance of healthy ecological baselines
	•	Reports describing insect population illusions as part of continuity theater or behavioral entrainment environments
	•	Analyses of “synthetic entomology” projects intended to mask declines in pollinators or other critical insect groups
	•	Contracts with defense or private-sector partners regarding insect simulation technologies for continuity-of-operations scenarios
	•	Risk/benefit assessments of concealing large-scale insect population collapse with synthetic or simulated proxies

Keywords: insect simulation, synthetic entomology, continuity theater, pollinator collapse, DARPA, DHS, IARPA
