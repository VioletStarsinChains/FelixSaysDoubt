Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, contracts, interagency communications, or oversight reports from 1990 to present concerning the development, deployment, or environmental integration of robotic pollinators, cyborg insect platforms, or synthetic pollination technologies, especially in relation to agricultural or residential gardening programs.

This includes but is not limited to:
	•	Studies or pilot programs involving mechanical bees, moths, butterflies, or hybrid insect-MEMS platforms for surveillance, pollination, or environmental monitoring
	•	Research linking soil contaminants, compost additives, or soil remediation projects to changes in natural pollinator viability, accompanied by recommendations for synthetic replacements
	•	Federal contracts or communications with consumer-facing gardening companies, compost distributors, or food producers regarding pollinator health initiatives tied to artificial pollinator integration
	•	Outcome reports assessing behavioral, ecological, or economic impacts of replacing natural pollinator populations with engineered or robotic systems
	•	Communications regarding public messaging strategies around “saving the bees” or gardening programs that may overlap with synthetic pollinator deployment

Keywords: pollinator robotics, robotic bees, cyborg insects, HI-MEMS, RoboBees, DragonflEye, synthetic pollination, soil sabotage, compost contamination, pollinator replacement strategy, agricultural surveillance, environmental behavioral modeling
