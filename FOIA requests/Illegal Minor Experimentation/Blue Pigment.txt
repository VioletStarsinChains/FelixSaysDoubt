Subject: Request for Records Regarding Blue Pigments in Food and Packaging and Their Behavioral Effects on Children

This is a request under the Freedom of Information Act. I am seeking all records, including but not limited to studies, internal communications, contracts, grant proposals, marketing analyses, safety assessments, and interagency correspondence, concerning:
	1.	Behavioral or neurological effects of artificial blue food dyes (e.g., FD&C Blue No. 1, FD&C Blue No. 2) and other synthetic or natural blue pigments when used in food or food packaging.
	2.	Any studies or internal assessments on the effects of blue-heavy packaging or visual environments on child behavior, attention, hyperactivity, or arousal.
	3.	Specific research, internal reports, or contract work related to effects of these pigments or color schemes on neurodivergent children (including autism, ADHD, sensory processing disorders, and other neurological differences).
	4.	Industry or academic collaborations involving pigment manufacturers, food producers, or marketing firms studying the psychological or physiological effects of blue pigments or high-saturation blue visuals in retail food settings.
	5.	Any materials or guidance documents used to assess or regulate the use of high-saturation blue pigments in food products marketed toward children.

For the purposes of this request, “records” include but are not limited to emails, memoranda, meeting notes, slide decks, white papers, unpublished studies, marketing research data, and correspondence with external entities.

I request that this search include records from January 1, 1980 to the present.

If any portion of the requested records is exempt from disclosure, please release any reasonably segregable portions.
