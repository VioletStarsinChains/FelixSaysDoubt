To: Food and Drug Administration / Centers for Disease Control and Prevention / National Institutes of Health

Request:

Requesting any and all studies, internal communications, vendor contracts, or safety assessments from 1980 to present concerning the potential neurobehavioral or suggestibility-related effects of ingredients commonly used in communion wine, grape juice, and wafers consumed by minors in religious contexts.

This includes:
	•	Research on the acute or long-term neurological impact of ethanol, sulfites, or other wine constituents when administered in small amounts to children
	•	Studies on preservative agents (e.g., sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate) in grape juice and their effects on attention, mood, or cognitive receptivity in minors
	•	Assessments of refined starch or gluten-derived peptides in wafers and their potential interaction with opioid receptors or other neurochemical pathways in developing brains
	•	Behavioral analyses of sugar or glycemic load effects from sacramental elements during prolonged services
	•	Records of any coordinated research with religious institutions on ingestion-linked behavioral entrainment in youth populations

Keywords: sacramental wine safety, communion wafer neurobehavioral effects, preservative behavioral study, youth suggestibility research, gluten peptide opioid receptor, glycemic load attention span, ethanol pediatric neuroimpact, ingestion-linked ritual entrainment

To USDA / Agricultural Research Service (ARS) / National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) / Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) / Economic Research Service (ERS)

Request:

Requesting any and all studies, grants, contracts, internal communications, commodity or food safety assessments, and contractor deliverables from 1980 to present on the potential neurobehavioral or suggestibility‑related effects of ingredients used in communion wine, grape juice, and wafers consumed by minors in religious settings, including:
	•	ARS- or NIFA‑funded research on pediatric exposure to trace ethanol in sacramental contexts and associated attention, inhibition, or state‑dependent learning effects
	•	Studies or risk assessments on sulfites and other wine constituents (including pesticide/fungicide residues or mycotoxins in grape products) with possible impacts on mood, cognition, or behavior in children
	•	Research on preservatives in grape juice (e.g., sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate) and any documented interactions with vitamin C or mitochondrial/neurological endpoints relevant to youth attention or arousal
	•	Analyses of refined starch/glycemic load from wafers and acute effects on attention, fatigue, or compliance behaviors during prolonged services
	•	Investigations of gluten‑derived peptides (e.g., gliadorphin/exorphins) and their potential engagement with opioid pathways in susceptible pediatric subgroups
	•	Sensory/organoleptic studies of grape products and wafers in youth populations that evaluate attentional state, arousal, or receptivity as behavioral endpoints
	•	Communications or agreements with universities, commodity boards, or vendors supplying sacramental grape products or wafers for research involving child participants
	•	Any guidance, briefing notes, or literature reviews prepared by USDA components summarizing potential neurobehavioral considerations for grape products or refined starch intake in minors

Keywords: USDA ARS, NIFA grant, sacramental wine safety, communion wafer effects, youth neurobehavioral outcomes, sulfites preservatives, sodium benzoate potassium sorbate, gluten exorphin gliadorphin, glycemic load attention, grape pesticide residue, ritual ingestion entrainment, pediatric suggestibility
