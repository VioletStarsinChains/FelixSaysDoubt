To DARPA / NIH / Department of Education / HHS

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, internal communications, contracts, research proposals, or vendor agreements referencing the use of neurotechnology or neuromodulation as a method of behavioral conditioning, specifically in comparison to or building upon historical practices such as forced handedness conversion, applied behavioral analysis (ABA), or conversion therapy, from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Studies or pilot programs exploring the modification of natural neural wiring patterns to conform to socially “preferred” behaviors
	•	Research on neurostimulation (tDCS, TMS, DBS) or brain-computer interfaces for behavior normalization in children or adults
	•	Documentation comparing historical left-handedness conversion, ABA, or conversion therapy with modern neurotech approaches
	•	Ethical reviews or risk-benefit analyses addressing potential harms of behavioral normalization through neurotech
	•	Communications between agencies and contractors (e.g., Palantir, Medtronic, Neuralink, Accenture, or similar) regarding behavioral entrainment applications
	•	Reports on “algorithmic conformity,” “neuromodulatory normalization,” or “therapeutic compliance optimization”
	•	Any connections to educational programs, school-based interventions, or juvenile justice initiatives

Keywords: neurotechnology conditioning, behavioral entrainment, applied behavioral analysis, handedness conversion, algorithmic conformity, neuromodulatory normalization, compliance optimization, conversion therapy, DARPA, HHS

To DARPA / NIH / Department of Education / HHS

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, internal communications, contracts, research proposals, or vendor agreements concerning the use of neurotechnology as a form of behavioral “conversion” therapy, from 1990 to present. This request specifically seeks records that frame or employ neuromodulation techniques (tDCS, TMS, DBS, BCI, AR/VR feedback loops) as modern analogs to:
	•	Forcing left-handed children to become right-handed
	•	Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) used to enforce compliance in autistic children
	•	Sexual orientation and gender identity “conversion therapy” practices

This includes:
	•	Research or pilot programs targeting atypical neurological traits (e.g., autism, ADHD, dyslexia, gender dysphoria) with neurotech-based conformity methods
	•	Reports comparing historical practices (handedness conversion, ABA, conversion therapy) to emerging neurotech interventions
	•	Internal discussions of “algorithmic conformity pressure,” “neuromodulatory normalization,” or “therapeutic compliance optimization”
	•	Ethical reviews acknowledging the risk of repeating past abuses in a technologically enhanced form
	•	Contracts with private contractors (e.g., Palantir, Medtronic, Neuralink, Accenture) developing tools that can be used for behavioral normalization in schools, clinics, or correctional facilities
	•	Communications linking neurotech-based behavioral interventions with youth populations, particularly in educational or juvenile justice contexts

Keywords: neurotech conversion therapy, forced handedness, ABA neurotechnology, behavioral futures, compliance optimization, algorithmic conformity, neuromodulatory normalization, child conditioning, DARPA, HHS
