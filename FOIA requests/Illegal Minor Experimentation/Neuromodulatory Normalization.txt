To DARPA / NIH / Department of Education / HHS

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, internal communications, contracts, research proposals, or vendor agreements referencing the use of neurotechnology or neuromodulation as a method of behavioral conditioning, specifically in comparison to or building upon historical practices such as forced handedness conversion, applied behavioral analysis (ABA), or conversion therapy, from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Studies or pilot programs exploring the modification of natural neural wiring patterns to conform to socially “preferred” behaviors
	•	Research on neurostimulation (tDCS, TMS, DBS) or brain-computer interfaces for behavior normalization in children or adults
	•	Documentation comparing historical left-handedness conversion, ABA, or conversion therapy with modern neurotech approaches
	•	Ethical reviews or risk-benefit analyses addressing potential harms of behavioral normalization through neurotech
	•	Communications between agencies and contractors (e.g., Palantir, Medtronic, Neuralink, Accenture, or similar) regarding behavioral entrainment applications
	•	Reports on “algorithmic conformity,” “neuromodulatory normalization,” or “therapeutic compliance optimization”
	•	Any connections to educational programs, school-based interventions, or juvenile justice initiatives

Keywords: neurotechnology conditioning, behavioral entrainment, applied behavioral analysis, handedness conversion, algorithmic conformity, neuromodulatory normalization, compliance optimization, conversion therapy, DARPA, HHS
