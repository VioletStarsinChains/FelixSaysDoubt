Request:

Requesting any and all reports, laboratory analyses, risk assessments, meeting notes, internal communications, and contractor deliverables from 1990 to present referencing the neurobehavioral effects of chemical exposure from children’s footwear and related consumer products, including but not limited to:
	•	Heavy metals (lead, cadmium, chromium VI, mercury) and their impact on impulse control, attention regulation, and susceptibility to social influence
	•	Phthalates (DEHP, DINP, DBP, BBP, DOTP) and endocrine-disrupting effects on mood, stress response, and risk perception
	•	PFAS compounds in water-repellent or stain-resistant coatings and their role in thyroid hormone disruption, fatigue, and cognitive flexibility
	•	Formaldehyde and other VOCs from adhesives and synthetic materials, with particular focus on decision-making, attention, and fatigue in exposed children
	•	Azo dyes and aromatic amine breakdown products from textiles and linings, and any documented impacts on mood stability or sensory processing
	•	Antimicrobial agents (triclosan, silver nanoparticles, quaternary ammonium compounds) and their influence on gut microbiome–brain axis function

Keywords:
lead exposure, cadmium toxicity, chromium VI, mercury neurotoxicity, phthalates, DEHP, DINP, PFAS, perfluoroalkyl, PFOA, PFOS, formaldehyde, VOC neurobehavior, azo dyes, aromatic amines, triclosan, silver nanoparticles, quaternary ammonium, impulse control, suggestibility, cognitive flexibility, mood regulation, neurodevelopmental effects, endocrine disruption
