To FDA / DEA / HHS (Food and Drug Administration, Drug Enforcement Administration, and Department of Health and Human Services)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, internal communications, incident reports, vendor contracts, or consumer safety investigations concerning the adulteration or substitution of consumer food products and/or prescribed medications with dissociative anesthetics (including but not limited to ketamine) between 1990 and present.

This includes:
	•	Reports or investigations into nut products (e.g., pistachios, peanuts, cashews) containing undeclared pharmacological agents
	•	Records of pharmaceutical packaging or labeling errors where cromolyn sodium was replaced or contaminated with dissociative agents
	•	Safety bulletins or recalls concerning cross-contamination between mast cell stabilizers and anesthetic/psychoactive drugs
	•	Interagency communications regarding intentional adulteration of consumer food or medication supply for behavioral, psychological, or compliance modeling purposes
	•	Research contracts or grants exploring controlled substitution or microdosing of dissociatives in food/medicine delivery vectors
	•	Consumer complaint records alleging sedation, dissociation, or hallucination following consumption of food products or cromolyn formulations

Keywords: adulteration, substitution, ketamine, cromolyn sodium, dissociative anesthetic, food contamination, pharmacological mislabeling, mast cell stabilizer, behavioral modeling, compliance conditioning

To FDA / DEA / HHS (Food and Drug Administration, Drug Enforcement Administration, Department of Health and Human Services)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, internal communications, incident reports, pharmaceutical audits, vendor contracts, or consumer safety investigations concerning the adulteration, substitution, or diversion of intramuscular injectable medications—including testosterone cypionate and ketamine—from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Records of mislabeling or substitution of Schedule III injectables (e.g., testosterone esters, ketamine, anabolic steroids, or other controlled substances)
	•	Safety bulletins or recalls involving injectable vials where the active compound was replaced or cross-contaminated with dissociatives, anesthetics, or unrelated controlled substances
	•	Reports of intentional adulteration or substitution in clinical or research contexts, particularly where patient outcomes included dissociation, amnesia, or altered perception
	•	Interagency communications or contractor research concerning injectable substitution as a delivery vector for behavioral modeling or compliance conditioning
	•	Consumer complaint or adverse event records where expected endocrine outcomes (testosterone therapy) were replaced by dissociative/anesthetic effects (ketamine)
	•	Oversight reports on chain-of-custody, compounding pharmacies, or specialty clinics handling testosterone cypionate, ketamine, and other IM injectables

Keywords: testosterone cypionate, ketamine, injectable substitution, IM injection, pharmaceutical adulteration, compounding pharmacy, Schedule III, controlled substances, behavioral modeling, compliance conditioning

To FDA / DEA / HHS (Food and Drug Administration, Drug Enforcement Administration, Department of Health and Human Services)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, internal communications, incident reports, pharmaceutical audits, vendor contracts, or research studies concerning the substitution of intramuscular injectable medications with dissociative anesthetics (including but not limited to ketamine) without informed consent, from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Records of patient reports or adverse event filings where testosterone cypionate, cromolyn sodium, or other IM injectables were suspected to contain or be substituted with dissociatives
	•	Safety bulletins, recalls, or internal investigations into covert substitution of Schedule III medications with unrelated controlled substances
	•	Interagency communications or contractor research concerning covert use of ketamine or other dissociatives for behavioral modeling, compliance conditioning, or identity-related studies
	•	Reports or audits quantifying the number of patients exposed to substituted or adulterated injectables in clinical or compounding pharmacy contexts
	•	Documentation of research protocols where dissociatives were delivered under the guise of unrelated endocrine, allergy, or pain management therapy
	•	Consumer complaint data noting rapid dissociative calm, perceptual changes, or amnesia following an injection expected to produce only endocrine or mast-cell–related outcomes

Keywords: ketamine, testosterone cypionate, cromolyn sodium, injectable substitution, non-consensual administration, dissociative anesthetic, Schedule III, compounding pharmacy, behavioral modeling, compliance conditioning
