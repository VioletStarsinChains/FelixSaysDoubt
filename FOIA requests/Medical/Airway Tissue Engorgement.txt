Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, contracts, internal communications, reports, or contractor deliverables from 1990 to present referencing fluid redistribution, tissue swelling, or edema in the context of simulated, altered, or variable gravity environments, including gravitational gradient and terrestrial microgravity conditions.

This includes:
	•	Studies on airway tissue engorgement, throat swelling, or respiratory restriction during reduced gravity or gravitational unloading, including parabolic flight and centrifuge protocols
	•	Medical or occupational evaluations of head and neck vascular or lymphatic fluid shift under altered gravity, acceleration, or field-effect environments
	•	Investigations into synthetic or gravity-induced anaphylaxis mimics — airway swelling without histamine release — in aerospace or defense research populations
	•	Research into regional fluid targeting under altered gravity conditions, including localized edema in cardiac, gastrointestinal, or neurological tissues
	•	Interagency or contractor collaborations linking gravitational variation to mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), dysautonomia, or connective tissue disorders such as Ehlers–Danlos Syndrome (EDS) and Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)

Keywords: fluid redistribution, edema, gravitational gradient, artificial gravity, terrestrial microgravity, airway swelling, synthetic anaphylaxis, mast cell activation syndrome, dysautonomia, Ehlers–Danlos Syndrome, POTS, lymphatic engorgement, head and neck vascular shift, DARPA, NASA, DoD
