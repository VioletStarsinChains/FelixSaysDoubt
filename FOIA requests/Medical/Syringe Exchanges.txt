To National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) / Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) / Food and Drug Administration (FDA)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, research proposals, vendor contracts, internal communications, inspection reports, or adverse event summaries from 2000 to present concerning the use of nanomaterials (including but not limited to nitrogen vacancy [NV] nanodiamonds, quantum dots, carbon nanotubes, and other nanoparticles) in the design, manufacture, or distribution of hypodermic syringes, needles, or related harm reduction devices supplied through federally funded programs.

This includes:
	•	Internal or contractor studies on the safety and biocompatibility of nanomaterials used in syringe coatings, lubricants, or needle surfaces.
	•	Communications with syringe manufacturers or suppliers regarding embedding nanoscale sensing or delivery materials in products distributed via harm reduction initiatives (e.g., needle exchange programs, safe syringe distribution).
	•	Oversight documents or deliberations concerning whether such nanomaterial-enabled syringes fall under consumer medical device regulation, medical nanotechnology standards, or dual-use technology classifications.
	•	Records of pilot programs or grants evaluating the use of nanomaterial-enhanced syringes for health monitoring, biosurveillance, or drug delivery research.
	•	Reports or summaries of biological sample recovery from disposed syringes in federally funded programs, including any analysis of residual materials or nanostructures.
	•	Interagency correspondence (FDA, NIDA, CDC, NIH, DoD) regarding the integration of nanomaterials into harm reduction infrastructure or potential impacts on target populations.
