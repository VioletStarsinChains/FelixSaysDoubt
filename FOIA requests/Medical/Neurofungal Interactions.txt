Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, internal communications, interagency agreements, or experimental reports from January 1, 2000 to present concerning the interaction of fungal colonization with mineralized or calcified soft tissues in relation to nerve function or implant activity.

This includes:
	•	Studies on fungal colonization of mineralized nerves or other soft tissues, and whether fungal networks can substitute for or enhance nerve conductivity
	•	Reports on biofilm or fungal hyphae acting as conduits for ion flow (sodium, calcium, potassium) relevant to neural signaling
	•	Assessments of how fungal colonization may increase the activity or conductivity of implantable neurotechnology
	•	Risk analyses of opportunistic fungal infections in patients with mineralized nerves, granulomas, or implanted medical devices
	•	Communications regarding whether fungi act as “living conductors” or biological amplifiers for neural interface systems
	•	Contracts, grants, or CRADAs involving DARPA, BARDA, NIH, or military medical branches on the role of fungi in neuromodulation, neural regeneration, or implant performance

Keywords: fungal colonization, mineralization, nerve calcification, biofilm conductivity, hyphae ion channels, implant interface, neurofungal interaction, DARPA BTO, BARDA, NIH NINDS
