*For 1990s records held by the Defense Special Weapons Agency (DSWA), DTRA’s predecessor.

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, tabletop-exercise materials, war-game reports, technical assessments, contractor deliverables, interagency communications, and policy/continuity annexes concerning federal planning, exercises, or modeling for large-scale infectious disease outbreaks (including novel respiratory pathogens) developed or conducted from 1989 through 2001.

This includes:
	•	Tabletop and field exercises, simulations, or red-team/blue-team war games involving pandemic or epidemic scenarios (exercise plans, MSELs, participant lists, after-action reports, lessons-learned, and briefing decks)
	•	Continuity of Government (CoG) and Continuity of Operations (COOP) pandemic annexes, including mass-fatality, hospital surge, critical workforce protection, and essential-services continuity plans
	•	Interagency communications (including with NSC staff) referencing federal posture for “emerging infections,” pandemic influenza, SARS-like coronaviruses, or airborne pathogen release, and any alignment with the 1992 Institute of Medicine report Emerging Infections
	•	Modeling and analytics on expected morbidity/mortality, critical care triage, scarce-resource allocation (ventilators, antivirals, PPE), vaccination/antiviral stockpiling, and workforce absenteeism
	•	Contracts, SOWs, and deliverables with external partners (e.g., RAND, SAIC, MITRE, Johns Hopkins/CSIS/ANL or similar) supporting pandemic preparedness planning or exercises
	•	Records establishing or evaluating national stockpiling initiatives (e.g., National Pharmaceutical Stockpile) and interagency coordination with State/locals on quarantine, border measures, and risk communication
	•	Briefings or policy options framing pandemic scenarios as national security risks, including potential impacts on force readiness, logistics, and civil infrastructure
