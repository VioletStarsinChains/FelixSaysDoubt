Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, contracts, internal communications, or reports from 2000 to present referencing intentional human or animal exposure to pathogens or microbiological agents known to affect neurological or behavioral function, in the context of:
	•	Studies of pathogen-induced behavioral or cognitive changes, including risk perception, impulse control, or decision-making
	•	Use of infection cohorts for predictive modeling, population-level behavior forecasting, or risk stratification
	•	Interagency or contractor research into environmental or agricultural pathways of exposure (e.g., food supply, compost, animal feed) for behavioral or cognitive outcomes
	•	Research programs connecting infectious disease exposure to social behavior, compliance, or group dynamics
	•	Assessment of pathogens’ potential role in shaping public health interventions, emergency response, or workforce readiness under behavioral stress

Keywords: pathogen-induced behavior, neurocognitive effects, infection modeling, behavioral prediction, predictive modeling, population risk, public health interventions, environmental exposure

Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, contracts, internal communications, or reports from 2000 to present referencing deliberate or experimental exposure of human or animal populations to pathogens known to influence behavior, cognition, or social functioning, specifically in the context of:
	•	Use of pathogen-induced behavioral changes (e.g., altered impulse control, compliance, aggression, or risk-taking) for predictive modeling of individuals or populations
	•	Integration of infectious disease cohorts into behavioral futures markets, including applications in forecasting, wagering, or outcome simulation
	•	Interagency or contractor discussions of covert or environmental infection pathways (e.g., food systems, animal vectors, compost, or soil amendments) as behavioral manipulation strategies
	•	Research into pathogens such as Toxoplasma gondii, influenza, coronaviruses, or other neurotropic agents for their effects on decision-making, compliance, or social cohesion
	•	Studies evaluating the economic or policy implications of pathogen-driven behavioral modification in controlled or semi-controlled populations

Keywords: behavioral futures markets, pathogen exposure, neurocognitive manipulation, predictive modeling, compliance, covert infection, population behavior, experimental exposure
