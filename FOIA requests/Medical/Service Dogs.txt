Subject: FOIA Request – Human–Animal Neurotechnology Co-Regulation Studies Involving Medical Service Dogs

Text:
This is a request under the Freedom of Information Act. I request access to any and all records, contracts, research proposals, technical reports, meeting minutes, or communications from January 1, 2000 to the present regarding:
	1.	Experimental use of medical service dogs in conjunction with human subjects equipped with neurotechnology implants, arrays, or interfaces, for the purpose of studying co-regulation, mutual entrainment, or stabilization of nervous system activity.
	2.	Studies assessing paired human–animal nervous system interactions where at least one partner in the pair has an implanted or wearable neurotechnology device.
	3.	Records describing service animals as biological buffers, filters, or stabilizers for human subjects with implanted neurotechnology, including research on autonomic nervous system coupling, heart-rate variability synchronization, or cross-species sensory feedback loops.
	4.	Any documents detailing long-range coupling or modulation effects between a human neurotechnology subject and a paired animal, whether intentional or incidental.
	5.	Funding awards, contracts, subcontracts, or grants awarded to universities, private research entities, or defense contractors for studies combining human neurotechnology and animal behavioral assistance in medical or defense contexts.
	6.	Records of collaboration between the DoD, VA, NIH, NSF, or private contractors on the design, evaluation, or deployment of such paired systems.

Please conduct searches of all relevant offices, including but not limited to neuroscience, behavioral research, human–animal interaction programs, and advanced medical device programs.

I request that all fees be waived, as the release of this information is in the public interest and will contribute significantly to public understanding of federal research involving neurotechnology and human–animal systems.

Keywords: medical service dogs, neurotechnology implants, brain-computer interface, human-animal interface, biofeedback, autonomic nervous system coupling, cross-species synchronization, co-regulation, paired system stability, neural stabilization, service animal bio-sensing, physiological coupling, animal-assisted neural rehabilitation
