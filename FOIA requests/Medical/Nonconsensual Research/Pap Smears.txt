Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, research proposals, grant reports, vendor agreements, regulatory filings, or internal communications from 2000 to present referencing the development, testing, approval, or clinical use of biosensors, implantable microdevices, nanomaterials, or other diagnostic/monitoring technologies designed for placement in or near the cervix during gynecological procedures (including but not limited to Pap smears, cervical biopsies, colposcopies, or related screenings).

This includes:
	•	Studies on nanoparticle coatings, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), or biosensing arrays designed for integration with cervical epithelium
	•	Clinical trials or pilot programs testing in vivo diagnostic devices during routine gynecological screenings
	•	Regulatory submissions, 510(k) clearances, or IDE applications for cervix-targeted biosensor or drug-delivery devices
	•	Interagency or contractor communications regarding mucosal-surface implantables, drug delivery systems, or “smart swabs” for cervical screening
	•	Ethical reviews, informed consent protocols, or risk-benefit assessments related to invasive biosensor deployment in reproductive health contexts

Keywords: cervical biosensor, implantable microdevice, MEMS, nanoparticle coating, mucosal drug delivery, in vivo diagnostic, gynecological procedure, Pap smear, colposcopy, cervix interface, FDA 510(k), DARPA BTO
