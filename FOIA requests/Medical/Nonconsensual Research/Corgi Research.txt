To USDA / NIH / Department of Defense / Department of Health and Human Services

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, data sets, research proposals, contracts, or internal communications concerning postmortem practices for companion animals, specifically cremation versus burial rates by breed, from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Mortality statistics, insurance claims, or veterinary practice data broken down by breed (including Pembroke Welsh Corgis and Cardigan Welsh Corgis) showing rates of cremation versus burial
	•	Contracts or collaborations with veterinary hospitals, pet crematoria, or pathology labs tracking breed-specific postmortem practices
	•	Reports or internal communications regarding evidence preservation, implant recovery, or potential continuity/security risks related to burial of companion animals
	•	Studies analyzing whether certain breeds are disproportionately cremated compared to others, and the stated rationale for such disparities
	•	Ethical reviews or veterinary guidance documents addressing postmortem handling of implanted or research-involved companion animals

Keywords: Pembroke Welsh Corgi, Cardigan Welsh Corgi, canine mortality, cremation rates, burial rates, veterinary pathology, companion animal implants, continuity risk, USDA veterinary oversight, NIH animal research

To NIH / USDA / Department of Defense / DARPA

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, studies, research proposals, contracts, or internal communications concerning cognitive, neurological, or behavioral research on Pembroke Welsh Corgis or Cardigan Welsh Corgis, from 1990 to present, where the data collected would reasonably require invasive or continuous neurophysiological monitoring.

This includes:
	•	Research reporting unusually detailed measurements of corgi neurological activity (e.g., cortical mapping, sleep-state tracking, gait–nerve coupling) without clear disclosure of invasive methodologies
	•	Contracts or grants supporting corgi-specific studies in cognition, intelligence, or problem-solving that rely on continuous neural signal capture
	•	Internal communications concerning the suitability of corgis as model animals for neurological research, behavioral entrainment, or implant-tolerance studies
	•	Ethical reviews, adverse event reports, or veterinary records relating to corgi neurological experimentation or unexplained postoperative complications
	•	Collaborations with universities, private contractors, or defense programs involving corgi neurological data outside of standard veterinary care

Keywords: Pembroke Welsh Corgi, Cardigan Welsh Corgi, canine cognition, neurophysiology, neural implants, continuous monitoring, behavioral entrainment, DARPA canine research, USDA veterinary oversight
