To NIH / USDA / Department of Defense / DARPA

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, studies, research proposals, contracts, or internal communications concerning cognitive, neurological, or behavioral research on Pembroke Welsh Corgis or Cardigan Welsh Corgis, from 1990 to present, where the data collected would reasonably require invasive or continuous neurophysiological monitoring.

This includes:
	•	Research reporting unusually detailed measurements of corgi neurological activity (e.g., cortical mapping, sleep-state tracking, gait–nerve coupling) without clear disclosure of invasive methodologies
	•	Contracts or grants supporting corgi-specific studies in cognition, intelligence, or problem-solving that rely on continuous neural signal capture
	•	Internal communications concerning the suitability of corgis as model animals for neurological research, behavioral entrainment, or implant-tolerance studies
	•	Ethical reviews, adverse event reports, or veterinary records relating to corgi neurological experimentation or unexplained postoperative complications
	•	Collaborations with universities, private contractors, or defense programs involving corgi neurological data outside of standard veterinary care

Keywords: Pembroke Welsh Corgi, Cardigan Welsh Corgi, canine cognition, neurophysiology, neural implants, continuous monitoring, behavioral entrainment, DARPA canine research, USDA veterinary oversight
