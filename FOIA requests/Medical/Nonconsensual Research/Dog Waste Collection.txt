To: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) / Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) / Minnesota Department of Health

Request:
Requesting any and all records, contracts, reports, or interagency communications from 2019 to present concerning the presence, testing, or management of biological hazards in animal waste collected from urban public spaces, including both bagged and unbagged fecal deposits.

This includes:
	•	Records of municipal or contractor testing programs measuring pathogens in animal waste left in public areas
	•	Reports on the role of companion animal waste in community-level disease surveillance
	•	Contracts or communications with private vendors responsible for street cleaning, waste collection, or biosolid processing
	•	Internal analyses linking animal waste to public health risk assessments or sanitation interventions

Keywords: animal waste, public sanitation, biosolids, pathogen monitoring, community health surveillance, environmental contaminants, EPA, CDC

FOIA (Spicy Angle – Biohazard Dispersal & Population Control)

To: Department of Defense (DoD) / Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) / Department of Homeland Security (DHS) / National Institutes of Health (NIH)

Request:
Requesting any and all documents, contracts, research proposals, or internal analyses from 2019 to present concerning the deliberate use of animal waste or synthetic fecal matter as vectors for biohazard dispersal, population-level illness modulation, or field-testing of medical countermeasures.

This includes:
	•	Programs involving dispersal of fecal simulants or biosolid byproducts in civilian environments to study pathogen transmission or immune response
	•	Communications with contractors or municipalities concerning deployment of waste products for surveillance, research, or compliance testing
	•	Reports describing animal waste distribution as a tool for behavioral futures modeling, illness-based attrition, or population control
	•	Internal analyses connecting companion animal waste to pandemic-era resilience testing or biodefense exercises

Keywords: fecal simulant, biosolid dispersal, biohazard vector, population control, illness modulation, DTRA, DHS, NIH, behavioral futures, biodefense testing
