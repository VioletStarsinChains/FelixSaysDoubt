To FDA / Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) / Office of Surveillance & Compliance / Vet-LIRN

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, internal communications, contracts, incident reports, inspection records, enforcement actions, laboratory protocols, and adverse event data referencing the use, testing, evaluation, or consideration of GLP-1 receptor agonists, incretin mimetics, or peptide-based appetite modulators as additives or functional ingredients in companion-animal foods or feeds (including refrigerated or frozen products), from January 1, 2015 to present.

This includes:
	•	Pilot studies, feasibility assessments, or stability/encapsulation studies of GLP-1–class peptides in pet food matrices (kibble, fresh/refrigerated, frozen, toppers)
	•	Cold-chain handling, temperature-stability, and shelf-life evaluations for peptide additives in refrigerated or frozen pet foods
	•	Communications with pet-food manufacturers, contract formulators, ingredient suppliers, AAFCO, and state feed control officials regarding peptide or “incretin” ingredients
	•	Vet-LIRN assignments, case definitions, or investigations related to unexplained weight loss/appetite suppression in pets potentially linked to pet food exposure
	•	Adverse event reports (ADE/product problem) containing terms related to appetite suppression, GLP-1 analogues, or incretin signaling in dogs/cats
	•	ORA field exams, import refusals, or compliance actions involving peptide or hormone-class ingredients intended for pet food
	•	Data-sharing or aggregate analyses with corporate veterinary networks (e.g., Banfield, VCA) regarding unusual trends in pet weight, appetite, or GI effects
	•	Intra- and inter-agency correspondence with USDA or CDC on peptide additives in animal food

Keywords: GLP-1, semaglutide, liraglutide, tirzepatide, exenatide, incretin mimetic, peptide additive, refrigerated pet food, cold chain, Vet-LIRN, AAFCO, adverse event (ADE)

To USDA / Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) / Agricultural Research Service (ARS)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, internal communications, contracts, incident reports, import/export oversight records, and interagency correspondence referencing GLP-1 receptor agonists, incretin mimetics, or peptide-based appetite modulators in the context of companion-animal foods or feeds (including refrigerated or frozen products), from January 1, 2015 to present.

This includes:
	•	ARS or APHIS research, surveillance, or literature reviews on peptide or hormone-class additives in pet food and their physiologic/behavioral effects in dogs/cats
	•	Cold-chain, storage, and stability evaluations for peptide additives intended for refrigerated/frozen pet foods
	•	Communications with FDA/CVM, AAFCO, pet-food manufacturers, or ingredient suppliers regarding GLP-1–class peptides or “incretin” ingredients for animal food
	•	Import/export controls, notifications, or refusals related to peptide ingredients destined for animal food manufacturers
	•	Incident reports or stakeholder complaints involving unexplained appetite suppression/weight loss in pets potentially linked to pet food exposures
	•	Any data-sharing with veterinary health networks regarding population-level trends in pet weight/appetite potentially associated with diet

Keywords: GLP-1, semaglutide, liraglutide, tirzepatide, exenatide, incretin, peptide additive, refrigerated pet food, cold chain, APHIS, ARS, interagency correspondence
