	•	Internal memoranda or briefing materials discussing anticipated epidemic dynamics prior to broad public acknowledgment (circa 1978–1983)

	•	Communications regarding delayed funding, restricted testing/treatment access, or targeted/non‑targeted outreach to stigmatized populations (e.g., gay men, IV drug users, incarcerated persons, sex workers)
	•	Contracts or collaborations with defense or intelligence entities analyzing HIV/AIDS as a stressor on workforce readiness, recruitment, or foreign policy objectives
	•	Policy drafts or public communication plans addressing narrative management, risk perception, or continuity concerns related to HIV/AIDS
	•	Ethical reviews or dissent cables referencing attrition, triage, or deliberate tolerance of morbidity/mortality in connection with HIV/AIDS response choices
