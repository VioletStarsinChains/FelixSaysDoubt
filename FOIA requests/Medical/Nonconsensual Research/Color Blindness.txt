FOIA (Clean Angle – Color Blindness & Visual Perception Research)

To: National Institutes of Health (NIH – NEI, NIMH) / Department of Defense (DoD – USAMRDC, DARPA) / National Science Foundation (NSF)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, grants, contracts, study protocols, reports, and interagency communications from 1990 to present concerning federal research into color blindness, altered color perception, or spectrum-specific vision modulation.

This includes:
	•	Studies on the genetic and neurobiological bases of color blindness or color vision deficiencies
	•	Research on sensory filtering, wavelength-specific perception modulation, or visual processing plasticity
	•	Reports on military or biomedical applications of color vision enhancement, suppression, or artificial substitution
	•	Communications regarding AR/VR or display technologies intended to adjust perception of blue/green/red spectra for users with atypical vision
	•	Safety assessments or ethics board discussions relating to experimental vision modulation

Keywords: color blindness, spectrum perception, visual entrainment, sensory filtering, neuroplasticity, DARPA, NEI, AR/VR vision

FOIA (Spicy Angle – Color Blindness as Neurotech-Mediated Entrainment Channel)

To: Department of Defense (DoD – DARPA, IARPA, USAMRDC) / Department of Homeland Security (DHS – S&T) / NIH (NEI, NIMH)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, contracts, reports, pilots, or internal analyses from 1990 to present concerning the use of color blindness or spectrum-specific perception filtering as a framework for neurotechnology-mediated entrainment or continuity-theater applications.

This includes:
	•	Records describing experimental suppression or gating of specific color channels (e.g., blue spectrum) in human subjects to evaluate entrainment response
	•	Reports on color perception filtering as a tool for population management, continuity reinforcement, or crowd compliance modeling
	•	Communications on the role of AR/VR overlays, lighting infrastructure, or wavelength filters in producing selective perception of colors
	•	Analyses explicitly comparing genetic color blindness to engineered or neurotech-induced spectrum gating
	•	Risk assessments, ethical reviews, or program evaluations of using “color blindness” as a cover category for perception modulation

Keywords: color blindness, perception gating, spectrum suppression, neurotech entrainment, continuity theater, DARPA, IARPA, DHS
