To NIH / National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) / National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) / Office of Research on Women’s Health (ORWH)

Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, grant applications, internal reports, contractor deliverables, or interagency communications from 1990 to present concerning X–Y chromosomal translocations in individuals with a baseline XX karyotype (e.g., 47,XX,+t(X;Y)).

This includes:
	•	Records of federally funded studies on X–Y translocations, derivative sex chromosomes, or marker chromosomes in XX individuals.
	•	Reports analyzing the genetic, immune, metabolic, or reproductive health effects of carrying an X–Y translocation chromosome in addition to two X chromosomes.
	•	Communications between NICHD, NHGRI, ORWH, and external researchers regarding the role of X–Y translocations in conditions such as immune dysregulation, antibody production, fertility, or mast cell disorders.
	•	Oversight reviews, ethical assessments, or genetic counseling guidelines related to disclosure of X–Y translocation findings to patients, especially in contexts where ultrasounds, fertility assessments, or antibody testing revealed anomalies.
	•	Documentation of population studies, clinical trials, or genome-wide association studies where X–Y translocation carriers were identified but not classified under traditional XX, XXX, or XXY categories.
	•	Interagency correspondence with NIDDK, NIAID, or other NIH branches concerning immune/metabolic phenotypes associated with X–Y derivative chromosomes.

To Food and Drug Administration (FDA) / Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, internal reports, adverse event data, contractor deliverables, or interagency communications from 1990 to present concerning health outcomes in individuals with X–Y chromosomal translocations in an XX baseline (e.g., 47,XX,+t(X;Y)).

This includes:
	•	Reports, case studies, or surveillance data on immune or metabolic dysregulation in individuals identified with X–Y translocations, derivative chromosomes, or marker sex chromosomes.
	•	Records linking chromosomal anomalies involving X and Y material in XX individuals to conditions such as mast cell disorders, abnormal antibody production, autoimmunity, or metabolic instability.
	•	Documentation of adverse event reports or unusual clinical presentations (e.g., nonstandard uterine shapes, atypical reproductive outcomes, unusual vaccine/medication responses) where sex chromosome translocation was noted.
	•	Communications between FDA, CDC, and NIH regarding pharmacogenomic or toxicology studies that included X–Y translocation carriers as a special population.
	•	Oversight or ethics documents concerning disclosure and patient communication in cases where ultrasound, fertility evaluation, or antibody testing indicated possible X–Y derivative chromosomes.
	•	Any contractor analyses or population health studies that addressed the prevalence or underreporting of X–Y derivative chromosomes in female-classified individuals.
