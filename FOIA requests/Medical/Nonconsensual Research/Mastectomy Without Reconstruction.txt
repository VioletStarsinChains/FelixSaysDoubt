Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, studies, internal communications, contracts, memoranda, or reports from 2000 to present referencing cisgender women who undergo mastectomy for cancer-related reasons (including prophylactic mastectomy and treatment-related mastectomy) and do not pursue breast reconstruction or implants, specifically in the context of:
	•	Endocrine and hormonal changes following mastectomy without reconstruction
	•	Potential impacts on estrogen, progesterone, prolactin, and other hormone regulation post-mastectomy
	•	Long-term metabolic, bone density, and cardiovascular outcomes associated with surgical flatness after mastectomy
	•	Research on quality-of-life, fatigue, or systemic symptom changes correlated with hormonal shifts in this cohort
	•	Any comparison studies between women who remain flat after mastectomy and those who undergo reconstruction/implants, in terms of hormonal and metabolic outcomes

Keywords: mastectomy, prophylactic mastectomy, breast cancer, breast reconstruction, flat chest, hormonal effects, endocrine changes, prolactin, estrogen, metabolic outcomes

Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, studies, internal communications, contracts, memoranda, or reports from 2000 to present referencing cisgender women who undergo mastectomy for cancer-related reasons (including prophylactic mastectomy and treatment-related mastectomy) and elect not to receive reconstructive breast implants, specifically in the context of:
	•	Behavioral, psychological, or social outcomes associated with remaining flat post-mastectomy
	•	Studies of social, familial, or interpersonal reactions to women who do not undergo reconstructive surgery
	•	Cultural, occupational, or economic consequences associated with choosing not to receive implants
	•	Research into body image, stigma, or discrimination linked to surgical flatness after mastectomy
	•	Comparative studies between women who undergo reconstruction and those who remain flat
	•	Any analysis of long-term public health, mental health, or quality-of-life outcomes in this population
	•	Interagency or contractor communications regarding predictive modeling, psychosocial profiling, or policy considerations relating to women who choose not to reconstruct after mastectomy

Keywords: mastectomy, prophylactic mastectomy, breast cancer, breast reconstruction, flat chest, social stigma, body image, psychological outcomes, predictive modeling

	•	Behavioral, psychological, or social outcomes associated with remaining flat post-mastectomy, and how such outcomes are used for modeling consumer behavior, compliance, or risk tolerance
	•	Studies or trials examining the social, cultural, or economic stigma of women who refuse reconstruction, particularly where such data may inform predictive analytics or psychosocial targeting
	•	Research into outlier cohorts (“flat by choice”) within breast cancer populations as inputs for behavioral futures markets, especially when contrasted against reconstructed patients
	•	Analyses of whether women who reject reconstructive surgery represent higher or lower compliance profiles in medical, social, or commercial systems
	•	Communications involving the use of mastectomy-related body image data for anticipatory modeling in marketing, insurance underwriting, or psychological operations
	•	Any cross-agency discussions linking surgical flatness after mastectomy to long-term behavioral prediction, tracking, or neurocognitive surveillance

Keywords: mastectomy, prophylactic mastectomy, breast cancer, breast reconstruction, flat chest, behavioral futures markets, predictive modeling, body image, stigma, compliance profiling
