Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, internal communications, contracts, memoranda, or reports from 2019 to present referencing Long Covid (post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, PASC) in the context of:
	•	Modeling or predicting behavioral, cognitive, or decision-making volatility in affected populations
	•	Use of persistent symptoms (e.g., fatigue, dysautonomia, brain fog, connective tissue degradation, or immune dysregulation) as variables in behavioral prediction systems
	•	Studies examining Long Covid’s role in creating unstable baselines in test cohorts for the purpose of futures-style modeling of compliance, adaptability, or resilience
	•	Any reference to Long Covid patients as a “captive cohort” for behavioral or predictive analytics
	•	Interagency or contractor communications about deliberately leveraging disease volatility to improve behavioral futures market accuracy or to stress-test population-level interventions

Keywords: Long Covid, post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2, PASC, behavioral volatility, futures markets, predictive modeling, compliance, dysautonomia, connective tissue, immune dysregulation, captive cohort

Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, internal communications, contracts, memoranda, or reports from 2019 to present referencing Long Covid (post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, PASC) in the context of:
	•	Use of Long Covid cohorts as a profit vector within behavioral futures markets, i.e., exploiting chronic suffering and instability to generate financial opportunities
	•	Deliberate modeling of disease volatility to increase tradable uncertainty in prediction markets, rather than reduce it
	•	Studies framing Long Covid patients (including children and younger populations) as economically advantageous “high-yield” groups for predictive analytics or behavioral manipulation
	•	Contractor or interagency discussions of how persistent illness could be leveraged to amplify compliance, desperation, or vulnerability in ways that enhance monetization
	•	Any mention of Long Covid being framed as a “market opportunity” in relation to human behavior, decision-making, or societal disruption

Keywords: Long Covid, PASC, behavioral futures markets, profit vector, chronic illness monetization, volatility exploitation, predictive analytics, compliance, desperation economics, captive cohort
