To Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) / National Institutes of Health (NIH) / Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, research proposals, laboratory reports, interagency communications, or oversight reviews from 1990 to present concerning the use of genetically modified parasites or symbiotic organisms as tools for biosurveillance, physiological monitoring, or behavioral tracking.

This includes:
	•	Research on helminths, protozoa, or other parasites engineered to secrete or express proteins with electrical, magnetic, or fluorescent properties that could be externally read or stimulated.
	•	Studies or proposals describing parasites as symbiotic sensors for monitoring host immune activity, stress levels, or neurochemical states.
	•	DARPA, NIH, or CDC projects exploring living diagnostics, persistent implants, or symbiotic biosensors involving parasite species.
	•	Laboratory analyses or animal trials testing the feasibility of using engineered parasites for long-term, covert biosurveillance.
	•	Oversight reviews, risk assessments, or interagency communications addressing the ethical, biosafety, or dual-use concerns of parasites used in this capacity.
	•	Contracts or deliverables from private contractors (e.g., MITRE, Battelle, Booz Allen Hamilton, Palantir Technologies, RAND) related to parasite-based biosurveillance research.

Keywords: genetically modified parasites, helminths, protozoa, biosurveillance, symbiotic sensors, living diagnostics, persistent implants, DARPA, NIH, CDC, dual-use research
