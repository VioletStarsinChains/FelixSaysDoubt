To National Institutes of Health (NIH) / Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, research proposals, grant applications, laboratory reports, literature reviews, interagency communications, or oversight reviews from 1990 to present concerning the use of living organisms as diagnostic or monitoring tools in humans, with particular emphasis on parasites or symbiotic species.

This includes:
	•	NIH- or CDC-funded studies describing engineered parasites, helminths, or protozoa as potential platforms for living diagnostics or physiological monitoring.
	•	Research into symbiotic sensors capable of reporting on immune activity, stress states, neurochemical markers, or other internal host signals.
	•	Grant proposals, conference proceedings, or white papers discussing the feasibility of using parasites as persistent diagnostic platforms in public health contexts.
	•	Laboratory experiments or clinical trial records evaluating safety, persistence, and data-readout methods for parasite-based diagnostics.
	•	Oversight reviews or ethics panels considering the dual-use or biosafety implications of parasite-derived diagnostic systems.
	•	Communications between NIH, CDC, or affiliated contractors regarding the integration of parasite-based sensing into public health surveillance.

To Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) / National Institutes of Health (NIH) / Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, research proposals, laboratory reports, interagency communications, or oversight reviews from 1990 to present concerning the use of genetically modified parasites or symbiotic organisms as tools for biosurveillance, physiological monitoring, or behavioral tracking.

This includes:
	•	Research on helminths, protozoa, or other parasites engineered to secrete or express proteins with electrical, magnetic, or fluorescent properties that could be externally read or stimulated.
	•	Studies or proposals describing parasites as symbiotic sensors for monitoring host immune activity, stress levels, or neurochemical states.
	•	DARPA, NIH, or CDC projects exploring living diagnostics, persistent implants, or symbiotic biosensors involving parasite species.
	•	Laboratory analyses or animal trials testing the feasibility of using engineered parasites for long-term, covert biosurveillance.
	•	Oversight reviews, risk assessments, or interagency communications addressing the ethical, biosafety, or dual-use concerns of parasites used in this capacity.
	•	Contracts or deliverables from private contractors (e.g., MITRE, Battelle, Booz Allen Hamilton, Palantir Technologies, RAND) related to parasite-based biosurveillance research.
