To Food and Drug Administration (FDA) / Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) / National Archives and Records Administration (NARA)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, reports, contractor agreements, interagency communications, and oversight documents from 1950 to present concerning the continuity of U.S. biomedical experimentation programs transitioning from intelligence-led projects to FDA-regulated frameworks.

This includes:
	•	Historical and contemporary records concerning Sidney Gottlieb–associated CIA research programs (e.g., MKULTRA, ARTICHOKE) and their intersections with later HHS/FDA oversight of biomedical experiments involving psychoactive substances, behavioral modulation, or non-traditional delivery systems.
	•	Documentation of hand-offs, data transfers, or regulatory reviews related to human subject research initially conducted under CIA authority but later integrated into FDA/HHS frameworks.
	•	Records of FDA reviews, policy memos, or internal communications under Commissioner Scott Gottlieb (2017–2019) concerning behavioral modulation, neuromodulators, or covertly dosed agents (including GLP-1 analogs, neuropeptides, or psychoactive substances).
	•	Communications between FDA, CIA, DoD, and NIH concerning behavioral experimentation, chemical entrainment, or covert research protocols and their relationship to drug approval pathways.
	•	Oversight reports, ethics board minutes, or correspondence regarding continuity of responsibility for experimental data from earlier intelligence programs (1950–1975) to later public regulatory regimes (1976–present).
	•	Any internal analyses or policy discussions comparing historical “behavioral influence” research to modern FDA-regulated pharmacological interventions with behavioral effects.
