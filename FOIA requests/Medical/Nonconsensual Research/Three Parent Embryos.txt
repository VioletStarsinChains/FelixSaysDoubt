Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, grant files, protocols, IND/IDE submissions, adverse event reports, internal communications, or oversight reviews related to mitochondrial transfer/“three-parent” embryo techniques in the United States, from 1980 to 2005. This includes (but is not limited to) ooplasmic (cytoplasmic) transfer, mitochondrial donation/replacement therapy (MRT), spindle transfer, and pronuclear transfer, particularly in advanced maternal age or “high-risk” pregnancies and any work conducted in or affiliated with San Antonio, Texas (e.g., Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, UTHSCSA) or with military medical partners.

This includes:
	•	Research proposals, funded grants, contracts, protocol amendments, IRB approvals, and OHRP correspondence for ooplasmic/cytoplasmic transfer, MRT, spindle or pronuclear transfer.
	•	IND/IDE filings, FDA review memoranda, ethics opinions, and risk assessments regarding embryo manipulation involving donor cytoplasm/mitochondria.
	•	Monitoring plans and reports on heteroplasmy, genetic parentage tracking (nuclear DNA vs. mtDNA), maternal age stratification, and outcomes follow-up (pregnancy, neonatal, developmental).
	•	Adverse event reports, safety audits, data safety monitoring board minutes, and communications about procedure halts, suspensions, or policy changes.
	•	Interagency and contractor communications with military medical centers and civilian IVF/fertility clinics regarding these techniques, including site selection in Texas and San Antonio.
	•	Guidance, policy memos, and legal analyses concerning consent/authorization, disclosure to subjects, and interstate or interagency collaboration.
