Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, grant files, protocols, IND/IDE submissions, adverse event reports, internal communications, or oversight reviews related to mitochondrial transfer/“three-parent” embryo techniques in the United States, from 1980 to 2005. This includes (but is not limited to) ooplasmic (cytoplasmic) transfer, mitochondrial donation/replacement therapy (MRT), spindle transfer, and pronuclear transfer, particularly in advanced maternal age or “high-risk” pregnancies and any work conducted in or affiliated with San Antonio, Texas (e.g., Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, UTHSCSA) or with military medical partners.

This includes:
	•	Research proposals, funded grants, contracts, protocol amendments, IRB approvals, and OHRP correspondence for ooplasmic/cytoplasmic transfer, MRT, spindle or pronuclear transfer.
	•	IND/IDE filings, FDA review memoranda, ethics opinions, and risk assessments regarding embryo manipulation involving donor cytoplasm/mitochondria.
	•	Monitoring plans and reports on heteroplasmy, genetic parentage tracking (nuclear DNA vs. mtDNA), maternal age stratification, and outcomes follow-up (pregnancy, neonatal, developmental).
	•	Adverse event reports, safety audits, data safety monitoring board minutes, and communications about procedure halts, suspensions, or policy changes.
	•	Interagency and contractor communications with military medical centers and civilian IVF/fertility clinics regarding these techniques, including site selection in Texas and San Antonio.
	•	Guidance, policy memos, and legal analyses concerning consent/authorization, disclosure to subjects, and interstate or interagency collaboration.

Keywords: mitochondrial transfer, ooplasmic transfer, cytoplasmic donation, spindle transfer, pronuclear transfer, mitochondrial replacement therapy, heteroplasmy, three-parent embryo, advanced maternal age, IND/IDE, IVF, San Antonio

To NIH / National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) / National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) / Department of Defense (DoD) / University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UT Health SA)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, research proposals, grant applications, clinical trial data, interagency communications, or contractor reports from 1975 to present concerning the use of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) to achieve live births in cases involving sex chromosome anomalies, particularly X–Y translocations.

This includes:
	•	Records of federally funded or university-based studies on cytoplasmic transfer, nuclear transfer, or three-parent embryo techniques applied to individuals or families with sex chromosome abnormalities (e.g., X–Y translocations, derivative chromosomes, mosaicism).
	•	Clinical trial protocols, internal reports, or case studies documenting live births from experimental ART methods used to overcome infertility caused by chromosomal rearrangements.
	•	Oversight reviews, ethical board minutes, or correspondence discussing the potential for offspring with derivative chromosomes (e.g., 47,XX,+t(X;Y)) as a result of ART interventions.
	•	Interagency communications (NIH, NICHD, NHGRI, DoD, UT Health San Antonio, and related centers) regarding experimental embryo manipulation techniques in the late 1970s through 1990s, especially involving sex chromosome–related infertility.
	•	Funding records or contractor deliverables referencing “three-parent embryo,” “nuclear transfer,” “cytoplasmic rescue,” or “embryo repair” in the context of sex chromosome anomalies.
	•	Reports on health outcomes, long-term follow-up, or immune/metabolic anomalies in children conceived via these methods.
