To FDA / Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition

Request:

Requesting any documents, research proposals, internal communications, or vendor partnerships referencing the use of calcium or calcium-derived compounds as agents of cognitive or behavioral entrainment through dietary intake, particularly in fortified food products, from 1995 to present.

This includes:
	•	Internal studies on calcium’s neuromodulatory properties when combined with food-based delivery vectors
	•	Risk-benefit analysis documents related to widespread calcium fortification
	•	Communications regarding co-fortification proposals with magnesium or other minerals
	•	Reports on behavioral side effects or neuropsychiatric correlates in subpopulations

Keywords: calcium entrainment, food fortification, neurobehavioral modulation, dietary signaling, magnesium deficiency, cognitive compliance, CFSAN

To DARPA / Biological Technologies Office

Request:

Requesting any research proposals, white papers, contracts, or internal memos related to the use of calcium signaling pathways for cognitive entrainment, mood stabilization, or neuromodulation in civilian populations, with or without their knowledge.

This includes:
	•	Program proposals using calcium as a signal amplifier or behavioral anchor
	•	Investigations into soft tissue mineralization as a side effect or feature
	•	Cross-referencing with mast cell behavior, magnesium depletion, or neuroinflammation
	•	Deployments in field environments or through population-wide delivery systems (e.g., food, water)

Keywords: calcium signaling, entrainment, mineralization, behavioral modulation, BTO, magnesium antagonism, mood control, population-scale neurotech
