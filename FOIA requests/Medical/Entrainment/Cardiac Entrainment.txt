Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, internal communications, contracts, or experimental protocols referencing the use of cardiac entrainment for physiological or behavioral modulation from 1980 to present.

This includes:
	•	Studies on the synchronization of cardiac rhythms using electromagnetic, acoustic, or optical signals
	•	Research on cardiac entrainment as a means of altering autonomic nervous system balance, stress response, or emotional regulation
	•	Protocols involving non-invasive cardiac pacing for behavioral conditioning or performance enhancement
	•	Reports on unintended cardiac entrainment effects from military, surveillance, or crowd-control technologies
	•	Internal risk assessments related to cardiac entrainment and potential health consequences
	•	Patents or patent applications filed or funded by the agency relating to entrainment of heart rhythms for physiological or psychological influence

Keywords: cardiac entrainment, sinoatrial node modulation, heart rhythm synchronization, bioelectromagnetic pacing, EMF cardiac coupling, autonomic regulation, behavioral entrainment, non-invasive pacing, heart-brain coherence, physiological modulation

	•	Technical assessments of risks to targeted individuals from sustained or repeated cardiac entrainment exposure
	•	Discussions of cardiac entrainment as part of human factors engineering or psychophysiological influence strategies in operational settings
	•	Contracts or collaborations with private contractors or academic institutions conducting cardiac entrainment research for defense applications

Keywords: cardiac entrainment, sinoatrial node modulation, bioelectromagnetic pacing, directed energy physiology, acoustic pacing, heart rhythm synchronization, behavioral compliance, non-lethal weapons, autonomic disruption, psychophysiological influence
