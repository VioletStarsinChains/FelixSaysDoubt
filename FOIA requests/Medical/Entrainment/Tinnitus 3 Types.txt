Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, contracts, internal communications, reports, or contractor deliverables from 1990 to present referencing tinnitus — including regular tinnitus, reactive tinnitus, and pulsatile tinnitus — in the context of:
	•	Environmental or occupational exposures (acoustic, electromagnetic, vibrational, or atmospheric)
	•	Auditory system responses to variable pressure, gravitational gradients, or acceleration environments
	•	Neural modulation or neuromodulation devices and their impact on tinnitus onset, severity, or persistence
	•	Correlation of tinnitus with autonomic nervous system disorders, dysautonomia, or circulatory anomalies
	•	Defense or intelligence community studies on tinnitus as a physiological marker of environmental field exposure or directed energy effects
	•	Predictive modeling of tinnitus onset or change in severity in response to environmental triggers
	•	Cross-agency or contractor collaborations involving tinnitus research in military or aerospace populations

Keywords: tinnitus, reactive tinnitus, pulsatile tinnitus, auditory perception, hyperacusis, directed energy exposure, acoustic trauma, neuromodulation, dysautonomia, gravitational gradient, environmental exposure, acceleration environment, DARPA, DoD, VA, NIH

Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, contracts, internal communications, reports, or contractor deliverables from 1990 to present referencing tinnitus — including regular tinnitus, reactive tinnitus, and pulsatile tinnitus — in the context of:
	•	Simulated, altered, or variable gravity environments (“terrestrial microgravity,” “artificial gravity,” or gravitational gradient conditions)
	•	Acceleration or deceleration exposure studies (centrifuge, parabolic flight, rapid ascent/descent profiles) and their effects on auditory perception
	•	Changes in tinnitus presentation linked to intracranial pressure variation, barometric pressure shifts, or altered blood flow under acceleration
	•	Military, aerospace, or naval research into auditory system responses to environmental field effects, including gravitational or inertial modulation
	•	Contractor or interagency projects assessing tinnitus as a marker for human adaptation or vulnerability in altered-gravity or acceleration environments

Keywords: tinnitus, reactive tinnitus, pulsatile tinnitus, auditory perception, intracranial pressure, acceleration environment, gravitational gradient, artificial gravity, terrestrial microgravity, variable gravity, environmental field effects, aerospace medicine, DARPA, NASA, DoD, AFRL, NAVSEA, ONR
