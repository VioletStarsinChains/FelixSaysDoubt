To: Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) / HHS / CDC / NIH

Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, contracts, internal communications, or pilot program documentation from 2015 to present involving menstrual cycle data, hormonal telemetry, or femtech devices funded or coordinated by BARDA or its DRIVe program.

This includes:
	•	Use of menstrual cycle tracking in behavioral modeling or psychometric segmentation
	•	Deployment of femtech wearables for hormonal entrainment, mood mapping, or public health compliance prediction
	•	Studies linking menstrual irregularity to infection forecasting, stress modeling, or intervention planning
	•	Communications with femtech startups, digital health platforms, or AI vendors regarding menstrual data analysis
	•	References to menstrual suppression, modulation, or behavioral entrainment in pandemic-related interventions

Keywords: BARDA, DRIVe, menstrual cycle, femtech, hormonal telemetry, neuroimmune modulation, behavioral prediction, psychometric segmentation, fertility data, public health compliance, digital uterine diagnostics, wearable biosensors
