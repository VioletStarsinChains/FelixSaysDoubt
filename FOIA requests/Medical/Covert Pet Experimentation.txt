Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, research proposals, grant applications, adverse event reports, pathology findings, or interagency communications from January 1, 2005, to present concerning the occurrence, study, or experimental induction of unusually aggressive or rapidly progressing cancers in companion animals (cats, dogs, or other domesticated species) within federally funded or federally overseen veterinary, biomedical, or neurological research programs.

This includes:
	•	Internal reports, adverse event documentation, or post-mortem analyses describing tumor onset and progression periods of less than 30 days in companion animals used in research or reported by the public to agencies or federally affiliated laboratories
	•	Research proposals or operational plans involving environmental exposure, neuromodulation, or immune modulation in companion animals where cancer progression rate was a monitored variable
	•	Contracts, purchase orders, or project summaries for dual-use or defense-related veterinary studies in which cancer onset was an intentional or documented outcome
	•	Communications between federal agencies, research institutions, or veterinary facilities regarding requests for the acquisition, transfer, or post-mortem analysis of companion animals that developed unusually aggressive cancers
	•	Any studies, whether published or unpublished, analyzing potential links between rapid cancer progression in companion animals and environmental, neurological, or biomedical experimental exposures

Keywords: companion animal oncology, aggressive cancer onset, rapid tumor progression, veterinary pathology, dual-use research, immune modulation, neurological research, federally funded animal research, adverse event report, domesticated animal cancer
