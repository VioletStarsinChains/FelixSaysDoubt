Request:

Requesting any and all documents, studies, contracts, research proposals, vendor agreements, or interagency communications from 2010 to present concerning the non-metabolic or secondary effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists (including but not limited to Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and related compounds).

This includes:
	•	Internal or contracted studies on psychological or neurocognitive effects of GLP-1 use, including changes in impulse control, risk-taking, or mood regulation
	•	Reports or risk-benefit analyses on unintended behavioral changes in patients prescribed GLP-1 drugs
	•	Communications regarding off-label potential for addiction reduction, psychiatric stabilization, or affect regulation
	•	Market impact analyses of widespread GLP-1 adoption beyond weight management and diabetes care

Keywords: GLP-1 receptor agonists, Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, secondary behavioral effects, impulse control, affect regulation, addiction reduction, public health

To: DARPA / IARPA / HHS / NIH / FDA

Request:

Requesting any and all records, research proposals, internal communications, contracts, or interagency correspondence from 2010 to present regarding the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists (Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and related compounds) as tools for behavioral modulation or compliance testing.

This includes:
	•	Studies on GLP-1–mediated appetite suppression as a model for entrainment of impulse control in non-dietary contexts
	•	Research on affect flattening, arousal dampening, or compulsivity reduction as frameworks for emotional or behavioral stabilization
	•	Analyses of GLP-1 usage in shaping consumer demand patterns, volatility reduction, or predictive market forecasting
	•	Communications on dual-use applications of GLP-1 drugs in behavioral futures markets, identity modulation, or large-scale compliance modeling

Keywords: GLP-1 entrainment, Ozempic compliance, behavioral futures, affect dampening, demand shaping, arousal regulation, impulse control modulation, DARPA, IARPA

Request:

Requesting any and all records, research proposals, internal communications, contracts, or interagency correspondence from 2010 to present concerning the development, testing, or deployment of non-injectable delivery systems for GLP-1 receptor agonists (including semaglutide, liraglutide, tirzepatide, and related compounds) in the context of behavioral regulation, entrainment, or compliance testing.

This includes:
	•	Research on oral formulations (e.g., semaglutide tablets) as vectors for appetite suppression, impulse control, or affect dampening beyond metabolic effects
	•	Studies of GLP-1 delivery via patches, microneedles, wearables, or implantable slow-release devices as long-term compliance mechanisms
	•	Exploration of inhalable or nasal spray GLP-1s for direct central nervous system modulation
	•	Analyses of potential fortification of food, beverages, or consumer products with GLP-1s or GLP-1–like compounds as covert entrainment methods
	•	Market impact assessments of widespread GLP-1 administration in reshaping consumer demand and stabilizing behavioral futures forecasts

Keywords: GLP-1 compliance, semaglutide oral delivery, behavioral futures, non-injectable entrainment, affect dampening, wearable neuropharma, impulse modulation, consumer fortification, DARPA, IARPA
