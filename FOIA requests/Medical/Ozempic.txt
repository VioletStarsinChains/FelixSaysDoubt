Request:

Requesting any and all documents, studies, contracts, research proposals, vendor agreements, or interagency communications from 2010 to present concerning the non-metabolic or secondary effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists (including but not limited to Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and related compounds).

This includes:
	•	Internal or contracted studies on psychological or neurocognitive effects of GLP-1 use, including changes in impulse control, risk-taking, or mood regulation
	•	Reports or risk-benefit analyses on unintended behavioral changes in patients prescribed GLP-1 drugs
	•	Communications regarding off-label potential for addiction reduction, psychiatric stabilization, or affect regulation
	•	Market impact analyses of widespread GLP-1 adoption beyond weight management and diabetes care

Keywords: GLP-1 receptor agonists, Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, secondary behavioral effects, impulse control, affect regulation, addiction reduction, public health

Request:

Requesting any and all records, research proposals, internal communications, contracts, or interagency correspondence from 2010 to present regarding the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists (Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and related compounds) as tools for behavioral modulation or compliance testing.

This includes:
	•	Studies on GLP-1–mediated appetite suppression as a model for entrainment of impulse control in non-dietary contexts
	•	Research on affect flattening, arousal dampening, or compulsivity reduction as frameworks for emotional or behavioral stabilization
	•	Analyses of GLP-1 usage in shaping consumer demand patterns, volatility reduction, or predictive market forecasting
	•	Communications on dual-use applications of GLP-1 drugs in behavioral futures markets, identity modulation, or large-scale compliance modeling

Keywords: GLP-1 entrainment, Ozempic compliance, behavioral futures, affect dampening, demand shaping, arousal regulation, impulse control modulation, DARPA, IARPA

Request:

Requesting any and all records, research proposals, internal communications, contracts, or interagency correspondence from 2010 to present concerning the development, testing, or deployment of non-injectable delivery systems for GLP-1 receptor agonists (including semaglutide, liraglutide, tirzepatide, and related compounds) in the context of behavioral regulation, entrainment, or compliance testing.

This includes:
	•	Research on oral formulations (e.g., semaglutide tablets) as vectors for appetite suppression, impulse control, or affect dampening beyond metabolic effects
	•	Studies of GLP-1 delivery via patches, microneedles, wearables, or implantable slow-release devices as long-term compliance mechanisms
	•	Exploration of inhalable or nasal spray GLP-1s for direct central nervous system modulation
	•	Analyses of potential fortification of food, beverages, or consumer products with GLP-1s or GLP-1–like compounds as covert entrainment methods
	•	Market impact assessments of widespread GLP-1 administration in reshaping consumer demand and stabilizing behavioral futures forecasts

Keywords: GLP-1 compliance, semaglutide oral delivery, behavioral futures, non-injectable entrainment, affect dampening, wearable neuropharma, impulse modulation, consumer fortification, DARPA, IARPA

To: DARPA / IARPA / CDC / NIH / Department of Homeland Security / GSA (building systems oversight)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, research proposals, internal communications, contracts, or interagency correspondence from 2000 to present regarding the use of ventilation and HVAC systems as delivery vectors for chemical, pharmaceutical, or neuroactive compounds intended for behavioral modulation, entrainment, or compliance testing.

This includes:
	•	Studies on aerosolization of GLP-1 receptor agonists (semaglutide, liraglutide, tirzepatide, etc.) via HVAC or scent-diffusion systems to influence appetite, impulse control, or emotional affect
	•	Development of “signature scents” in casinos, malls, schools, or workplaces as covert carriers of psychoactive or compliance-related compounds
	•	Interagency correspondence on threshold dosing of odorless or masked entrainment agents in indoor environments where conscious detection is minimized
	•	Research on masking strategies (e.g., citrus, vanilla, or antiseptic cover scents) used to obscure delivery of active compounds in shared spaces
	•	Market modeling documents assessing the impact of HVAC-delivered entrainment on consumer behavior, workplace compliance, and behavioral futures predictability

Keywords: aerosolized compliance, HVAC delivery, GLP-1 receptor agonist aerosol, scent masking, behavioral entrainment, impulse dampening, affect modulation, ventilation entrainment, compliance vectors, odorless dosing
