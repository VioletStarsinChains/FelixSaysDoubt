Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, study protocols, contracts, or internal communications involving the deliberate destabilization, impairment, or dysfunction of a human organ system, followed by targeted intervention or restoration, from 1985 to present.

This includes:
	•	Induced dysfunction or destabilization of cardiovascular, immune, neurological, or endocrine systems
	•	Challenge-and-recovery protocols in human subjects or human analog models
	•	Controlled physiological stressors intended to impair organ/system function prior to rehabilitation or performance restoration
	•	Provocation tests or performance degradation–restoration sequences in defense, intelligence, or human performance research
	•	Cognitive or neuroimmune perturbation with subsequent remediation interventions

Keywords: induced dysfunction, targeted destabilization, challenge-recovery protocol, controlled physiological stressor, recovery kinetics, performance restoration, immune challenge model, provocation test, neuroendocrine perturbation, resilience induction
