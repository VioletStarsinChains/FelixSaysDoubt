Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, contracts, or internal communications concerning the integration of nanodiamonds, including nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, into consumer optical products such as sunglasses, eyeglasses, contact lenses, or AR/VR headsets, from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Studies on the optical or biosensing applications of nanodiamonds embedded in consumer eyewear or contact lenses
	•	Contracts or collaborations with private companies to incorporate NV nanodiamonds into lens coatings, frames, or optical tints
	•	Reports on potential migration of nanodiamond particles into the body through ocular or dermal contact
	•	Internal communications regarding the use of eyewear as a vector for behavioral monitoring, biosensing, or entrainment via nanodiamond-based technologies
	•	Ethical reviews or risk assessments related to large-scale public exposure to NV nanodiamond materials through consumer optics

Keywords: nanodiamond, nitrogen-vacancy center, NV center, sunglasses, contact lens, AR headset, biosensing, optical coatings, behavioral monitoring, consumer exposure
