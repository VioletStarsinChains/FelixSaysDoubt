To Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) / NIH / FDA

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, studies, research proposals, or internal communications concerning the carcinogenic properties of recycled plastics used in consumer goods, food packaging, or medical products, from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Internal or contracted studies on toxicological effects of recycled plastics, including leaching of additives, microplastics, or novel byproducts
	•	Risk assessments regarding consumer exposure to recycled plastics in food contact materials, water bottles, or medical devices
	•	Communications regarding regulatory thresholds for carcinogenic contaminants in recycled plastics
	•	Reports or evaluations of long-term health effects linked to recycled polymer use in federal procurement or consumer markets

Keywords: recycled plastics, carcinogenicity, toxicology, microplastics, leaching, additives, food packaging, medical devices, EPA risk assessment, FDA regulation

⸻

To Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) / NIH / OSHA / Department of Energy

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, studies, research proposals, or internal communications concerning the carcinogenic properties of recycled metals used in consumer products, industrial equipment, or food contact materials, from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Studies on toxicological or carcinogenic effects of recycled metals containing heavy metal contaminants, alloys, or residual coatings
	•	Risk assessments concerning occupational exposure to recycled metals in industrial or manufacturing settings
	•	Internal communications regarding recycled metal use in food packaging, cookware, or consumer electronics
	•	Reports on long-term health impacts of contaminated recycled metal streams in federal procurement or consumer supply chains

Keywords: recycled metals, carcinogenicity, heavy metals, toxicology, occupational exposure, food contact, consumer electronics, industrial safety, EPA risk assessment, OSHA standards

⸻

To Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) / NIH / Department of Defense / DHS

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, contracts, or internal communications concerning the carcinogenic properties of recycled plastics and recycled metals in consumer and industrial products, particularly in relation to population-level resilience or attrition modeling, from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Studies or assessments on carcinogenic risks of recycled plastics (e.g., additives, leaching, microplastics) and recycled metals (e.g., heavy metal contamination, alloy byproducts)
	•	Internal communications discussing recycled-material exposure as a variable in resilience modeling, attrition simulations, or long-term health forecasting
	•	Contracts with private vendors or defense contractors for toxicology or epidemiological studies of recycled materials in consumer or federal procurement supply chains
	•	Reports on population-level health impacts or workforce readiness linked to exposure from recycled plastic or metal streams
	•	Ethical reviews or risk–benefit analyses concerning intentional or unintentional use of recycled materials as vectors for carcinogenic exposure in civilian populations

Keywords: recycled plastics, recycled metals, carcinogenicity, attrition simulation, resilience modeling, behavioral futures, toxicology, supply chain integrity, population exposure, EPA risk assessment
