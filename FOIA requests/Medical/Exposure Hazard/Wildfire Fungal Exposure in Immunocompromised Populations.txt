Request:

Requesting any and all records, internal communications, contracts, or research proposals regarding the interaction between wildfire-associated fungal exposure and metabolic or immune vulnerabilities, from 2015 to present.

This includes:
	•	Studies examining whether wildfire smoke disperses fungal spores (e.g., Aspergillus, Coccidioides, Histoplasma, Cryptococcus) that disproportionately affect individuals with metabolic or immune dysregulation
	•	Research on how GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy (semaglutide, liraglutide, dulaglutide, exenatide, etc.) influences susceptibility to fungal colonization or infection under wildfire smoke exposure
	•	Reports or pilot projects addressing mineral deficiency (magnesium, zinc, selenium, iron) or mast cell disorders (e.g., MCAS) as cofactors in wildfire-related fungal illness
	•	Internal risk assessments or oversight documents connecting post-wildfire respiratory illness clusters to vulnerable subpopulations with metabolic or immune compromise
	•	Vendor or contractor projects integrating environmental monitoring, metabolic health, and fungal risk models into wildfire resilience planning

Keywords: wildfire smoke, fungal spores, GLP-1, semaglutide, liraglutide, dulaglutide, exenatide, Ozempic, Wegovy, Trulicity, mineral deficiency, magnesium, zinc, selenium, iron, mast cell activation syndrome, MCAS, metabolic vulnerability, respiratory illness
