Request:

Requesting any and all documents, studies, contracts, community health assessments, surveillance datasets, or internal communications from 2000 to present concerning circadian and mental health impacts associated with optical emissions (glare, flicker, spectral/polarization effects) from photovoltaic (PV) installations utilizing nanoparticle‑based coatings.

This includes:
	•	Measurements of flicker/stroboscopic modulation from PV arrays and correlations with sleep disturbance, anxiety, mood dysregulation, or migraine incidence
	•	Spectral reflectance and polarization mapping of nano‑coated PV surfaces (e.g., TiO₂, ZnO, Al₂O₃, Ag) and assessed effects on circadian rhythms (melatonin suppression, phase shifts)
	•	Epidemiological or community surveys near utility‑scale solar farms tracking insomnia, irritability, headaches, cognitive complaints, or school/work performance impacts
	•	Clinical consultations, adverse event reports, or hotline/poison control summaries referencing PV‑related glare or light sensitivity
	•	Environmental justice analyses evaluating disproportionate mental health burdens from PV optical environments in adjacent communities
	•	Interagency communications on mitigation (siting, shielding, coating selection) to reduce circadian/mental health impacts
	•	Contracts or grants supporting research on light environment health effects specific to PV nanoparticle coatings

Keywords: circadian disruption, PV glare, flicker/stroboscopic, spectral reflectance, polarization field, nanoparticle coating, sleep disturbance, migraine, mood outcomes, utility‑scale solar, environmental justice, NREL

	•	Reports evaluating household-level or community-level survival outcomes following extended power loss
	•	Contracts or research proposals involving energy utilities (including ERCOT) and federal agencies regarding cold weather preparedness
	•	Internal communications concerning lessons learned from the event and recommendations for preventing similar grid disruptions
	•	Federal involvement in monitoring or analyzing population displacement, health outcomes, or public safety during and after the storm

To Department of Energy (DOE) / Department of Homeland Security (DHS) / Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) / DARPA

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, research proposals, or internal memoranda from 2015 to present concerning the use of the February 2021 Texas power grid failure and extreme cold weather event as an attrition simulation or behavioral modeling exercise.

This includes:
	•	Records of federally sponsored research into household- or community-level compliance testing during prolonged deprivation events
	•	Documents concerning ERCOT or other utilities providing real-time consumer usage data to federal agencies for behavioral futures modeling
	•	Internal communications on selective or rolling outages as a tool for differential survival analysis
	•	Reports or proposals linking the Texas freeze to predictive models of migration, housing demand, political realignment, or compliance under environmental stress
	•	Contracts with private vendors, defense contractors, or behavioral analytics firms involved in analyzing population responses during the freeze

Keywords: Texas freeze, attrition simulation, ERCOT, behavioral modeling, rolling outage, compliance testing, survival analysis, behavioral futures markets, resilience data, selective deprivation
