Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, contracts, or internal communications concerning the electromagnetic fields produced by Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) in public or workplace settings, and their potential effects on individuals with tattoo pigments or other dermal conductors, from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Studies on electromagnetic emissions from AEDs in standby or self-test mode
	•	Research into interactions between AED-generated fields and tattoo pigments containing metallic oxides, titanium dioxide, or other conductive compounds
	•	Reports on localized heating, nerve stimulation, or entrainment-like effects in tattooed versus non-tattooed individuals exposed to AED emissions
	•	Internal communications regarding AEDs as potential sources of unintended population-level exposure to electromagnetic fields
	•	Ethical reviews or risk assessments concerning disproportionate effects of AED emissions on tattooed populations in public environments

Keywords: Automated External Defibrillator, AED emissions, tattoo pigment, electromagnetic field exposure, dermal conductors, entrainment, titanium dioxide, metallic oxides, population sensitivity, FDA risk assessment
