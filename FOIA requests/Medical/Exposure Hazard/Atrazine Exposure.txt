Request:

Requesting any and all reports, toxicological assessments, epidemiological studies, meeting minutes, internal communications, and contractor deliverables from 1990 to present regarding human health impacts of atrazine exposure, including but not limited to:
	•	Endocrine disruption and hormonal imbalance in adults or children
	•	Reproductive and developmental effects (fertility, pregnancy outcomes, birth defects)
	•	Neurological and neurobehavioral outcomes associated with atrazine exposure
	•	Immunological effects or increased susceptibility to disease
	•	Carcinogenic potential in relation to chronic or acute exposure
	•	Presence and persistence of atrazine in drinking water and associated health risk assessments
	•	Synergistic or combined effects of atrazine with other agricultural chemicals

Keywords: atrazine, endocrine disruption, reproductive toxicity, developmental toxicity, neurobehavioral effects, immune suppression, carcinogenicity, drinking water contamination, pesticide exposure, hormonal imbalance, aromatase activation, combined pesticide exposure

Request:

Requesting any and all reports, toxicological assessments, epidemiological studies, meeting minutes, internal communications, contractor deliverables, and grant-funded research from 1990 to present regarding the impacts of atrazine exposure on adolescent and young adult human populations, including but not limited to:
	•	Endocrine disruption and alterations in sex hormone balance during puberty
	•	Neurodevelopmental outcomes tied to hormonal changes, including mood regulation, stress resilience, and social behavior
	•	Reproductive health indicators in individuals under age 25
	•	Regional or demographic analyses correlating atrazine exposure with developmental milestones or health disparities in rural or agricultural communities
	•	Longitudinal studies tracking identity-related health outcomes and psychosocial development in atrazine-exposed populations
	•	Cross-referenced datasets linking environmental exposure levels with mental health, educational attainment, or community health indicators in adolescents
	•	Research on cumulative or synergistic effects of atrazine with other agricultural chemicals, particularly in rural drinking water supplies

Keywords: atrazine, endocrine disruption, puberty timing, adolescent neurodevelopment, hormonal imbalance, environmental exposure mapping, rural health disparities, reproductive health outcomes, psychosocial development, longitudinal cohort, cumulative pesticide exposure, environmental justice, community health indicators
