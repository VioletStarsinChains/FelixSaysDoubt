FOIA — Law Enforcement Entrainment in Opioid Response Scenarios

To U.S. Department of Justice (Bureau of Justice Assistance; National Institute of Justice; DEA Training Division) / Department of Homeland Security (Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers) / National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST Office of Law Enforcement Standards)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, training materials, research proposals, internal communications, program evaluations, laboratory analyses, and interagency memoranda from 2000 to present regarding the use of stress inoculation, psychoacoustic methods, perceptual entrainment, or nocebo conditioning protocols in law enforcement training or field simulations related to opioid exposure scenarios (including fentanyl).

This includes:
	•	Training curricula or vendor-provided materials on “synthetic exposure” drills for officers responding to fentanyl or opioid-related incidents
	•	Research on psychoacoustic, infrasound, ultrasound, or RF-based entrainment methods tested on law enforcement personnel in controlled or field environments
	•	NIJ or NIST studies of physiological and behavioral responses to simulated opioid exposure without actual pharmacological contact
	•	Communications regarding the role of belief conditioning, nocebo effects, or perceptual overlays in shaping officer responses to fentanyl encounters
	•	Incident reports, after-action reviews, or laboratory notes documenting collapse, panic, or neurological symptoms in officers during simulated or staged exposure events
	•	Interagency discussions of these methods in the context of stress inoculation training, behavioral modeling, or predictive policing datasets

Keywords: fentanyl training, law enforcement entrainment, stress inoculation, psychoacoustic methods, perceptual conditioning, nocebo response, NIJ research, DEA training, NIST law enforcement standards, opioid exposure simulations

FOIA — Defense & Intelligence Research on Entrainment in Opioid Response Scenarios

To U.S. Department of Defense (DARPA; Defense Threat Reduction Agency; U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command) / Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) / Department of Homeland Security (Science & Technology Directorate)

Request:

Requesting any and all contracts, research proposals, technical reports, laboratory analyses, program evaluations, incident reports, internal communications, or interagency memoranda from 2000 to present regarding the use of psychoacoustic, perceptual, or physiological entrainment methods to simulate or induce symptoms of opioid exposure (including fentanyl) in training or operational contexts.

This includes:
	•	DARPA or IARPA projects exploring infrasound, ultrasound, RF, or other sensory entrainment techniques to create reproducible physiological or psychological responses mimicking opioid toxicity
	•	DTRA or USAMRDC records on the use of nocebo conditioning, stress inoculation, or perceptual overlays to test operator resilience or simulate drug exposure in non-pharmacological ways
	•	Research deliverables assessing behavioral reproducibility, collapse events, dissociation, or panic reactions triggered by entrainment versus actual pharmacological exposure
	•	DHS S&T communications on the potential transition of entrainment methods into law enforcement or first responder training curricula
	•	Interagency briefings or risk assessments discussing the dual-use implications of entrainment technologies in both defense/psyops and domestic training environments
	•	Contracts or cooperative agreements with universities, labs, or vendors conducting human subjects testing on entrainment-based opioid simulation protocols

Keywords: fentanyl simulation, entrainment research, psychoacoustic methods, perceptual overlays, nocebo conditioning, stress inoculation, DARPA, IARPA, DTRA, USAMRDC, DHS S&T
