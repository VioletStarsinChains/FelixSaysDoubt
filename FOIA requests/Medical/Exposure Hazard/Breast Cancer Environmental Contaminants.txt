	•	Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (e.g., BPA, phthalates, parabens, alkylphenols, atrazine)
	•	Persistent organic pollutants (e.g., PCBs, dioxins, organochlorine pesticides)
	•	Heavy metals and metalloids (e.g., cadmium, arsenic, nickel, chromium compounds)
	•	Industrial or household chemical exposures (e.g., PAHs, PFAS, VOCs, benzene, styrene)
	•	Environmental radiation sources (ionizing and non-ionizing)
	•	Cross-analysis of environmental exposures with breast cancer incidence, severity, or treatment outcomes
	•	Predictive modeling, surveillance, or risk stratification efforts linking environmental contaminants to breast cancer clusters or population trends

Request:

Requesting any and all contracts, research proposals, internal communications, memoranda, or reports from 2000 to present referencing breast cancer or related environmental exposure syndromes in the context of behavioral futures markets. This includes but is not limited to:
	•	Use of environmental contaminants (e.g., endocrine disruptors, persistent organic pollutants, heavy metals, radiation sources) in predictive modeling of population health outcomes
	•	Exploitation of breast cancer risk or incidence as a volatility driver for health-related prediction markets
	•	Interagency or contractor communications regarding the use of cancer diagnoses or survivorship trajectories as predictive inputs for behavioral markets
	•	Deliberate or incidental engineering of environmental conditions (air, water, food chain contamination) for the purpose of creating forecastable volatility in breast cancer rates
	•	Cross-analysis of breast cancer clusters with financial or behavioral data sets to assess predictive accuracy or commercial application in futures markets

Keywords: breast cancer, behavioral futures markets, predictive modeling, volatility, population health forecasting, endocrine disruptor, PFAS, PCBs, dioxins, cadmium, cancer clusters, DARPA, DoD, synthetic exposure, environmental engineering

To: Department of Defense (DoD) / Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) / Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) / National Institutes of Health (NIH) / Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)

Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, contracts, internal communications, memoranda, or reports from 2000 to present referencing breast cancer or related environmental exposure syndromes in connection with behavioral futures markets and profit-making opportunities derived from population suffering. Specifically seeking documents that address:
	•	Deliberate or tolerated environmental contamination (endocrine disruptors, persistent organic pollutants, heavy metals, radiation) where increased breast cancer incidence created forecastable volatility in behavioral or financial markets
	•	Interagency or contractor communications on the exploitation of breast cancer as a driver of market speculation, including predictive accuracy benchmarks tied to morbidity and mortality
	•	Cross-analysis of breast cancer incidence, treatment uptake, and survivorship with consumer behavior, workforce participation, or political behavior for commercial or surveillance purposes
	•	Development of algorithms or models that explicitly monetize disease progression, recurrence, or survivorship as forecastable events
	•	Any mention of the ethical considerations, or lack thereof, in treating cancer diagnoses not as tragedies but as financial instruments in prediction markets

Keywords: breast cancer, behavioral futures markets, prediction markets, volatility, profiteering, population suffering, endocrine disruptor, PFAS, PCBs, dioxins, cadmium, cancer clusters, DARPA, DoD, market speculation, disease commodification

Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, contracts, internal communications, memoranda, or reports from 2000 to present referencing preemptive mastectomies or breast implants in connection with:
	•	Studies or pilot programs involving medical implants, biosensors, or neurotechnology concealed within breast prostheses or reconstructive implants
	•	Communications between DoD, DARPA, NIH, HHS, FDA, and/or contractors regarding the dual-use potential of breast reconstruction devices for surveillance, telemetry, or physiological modulation
	•	Research on post-mastectomy surveillance, behavioral monitoring, or health telemetry that extends beyond standard oncological follow-up
	•	Development of predictive models or behavioral analytics derived from women receiving prophylactic mastectomies and subsequent implants
	•	Ethical reviews or memoranda addressing the overlap of oncological care, reconstructive surgery, and covert technology insertion

Keywords: breast implants, mastectomy, reconstructive surgery, prophylactic mastectomy, biosensors, covert implants, neurotechnology, DARPA, DoD, telemetry, dual-use medical devices, surveillance medicine

Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, contracts, internal communications, memoranda, or reports from 2000 to present referencing preemptive mastectomies and/or breast implants in the context of:
	•	The use of oncological fear (cancer risk, BRCA gene messaging, prophylactic mastectomy campaigns) as a pretext for widespread deployment of dual-use implants containing covert neurotechnology
	•	Studies or pilot programs where reconstructive or cosmetic breast implants were embedded with biosensors, telemetry hardware, or behavior-modulating devices
	•	Interagency or contractor communications concerning behavioral futures markets built on data harvested from women undergoing mastectomies and subsequent reconstruction
	•	Ethical memoranda, legal risk assessments, or institutional reviews that considered how coerced or incentivized medical procedures could normalize insertion of surveillance technology in vulnerable populations
	•	Modeling of public opinion or trust management strategies for concealing dual-use implant initiatives under the cover of women’s health and empowerment messaging

Keywords: breast implants, mastectomy, prophylactic mastectomy, BRCA gene, biosensors, covert implants, neurotechnology, DARPA, DoD, behavioral futures markets, surveillance medicine, gendered exploitation, predictive analytics
