Request:

Requesting any and all documents, studies, research proposals, contracts, or internal communications concerning the accumulation of environmental contaminants in yellow pine species (including Southern yellow pine and related taxa) and the associated human health risks from their use in lumber, paper, or other consumer products, from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Studies on uptake of heavy metals (arsenic, cadmium, lead, chromium, mercury, etc.), radionuclides (strontium-90, cesium-137), or organic pollutants (PAHs, PCBs, pesticides) by yellow pine trees
