FOIA – Cosmetic Safety of Pit-Based Exfoliants

To: Food and Drug Administration (FDA) / Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) / Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, reports, contracts, or interagency communications from 1990 to present concerning the safety of cosmetics and personal care products formulated with ground apricot pits, peach pits, or similar stone-fruit kernels used as exfoliants.

This includes:
	•	Records of safety assessments or toxicological analyses of amygdalin, cyanogenic compounds, or pesticide residues in stone-fruit–derived cosmetic ingredients
	•	Reports on dermatological effects of pit-based scrubs, including microtears, infections, or adverse skin reactions
	•	Contracts with universities, testing labs, or private contractors to evaluate safety of apricot scrubs and similar products
	•	Internal memoranda or communications regarding the regulation of natural exfoliants derived from stone-fruit pits

Keywords: apricot scrub, pit-based exfoliant, amygdalin, cyanogenic glycosides, cosmetic safety, FDA, CFSAN, CPSC, dermatology

FOIA (Spicy Angle – Continuity Theater & Exposure Vectors)

To: Department of Homeland Security (DHS) / Department of Defense (DoD) / Food and Drug Administration (FDA)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, contracts, reports, or internal analyses from 1990 to present concerning the use of apricot pit–based exfoliants or similar cosmetics as potential vectors for environmental exposure, continuity theater mechanisms, or behavioral futures research.

This includes:
	•	Records describing the use of stone-fruit–derived scrubs as controlled exposure tools for low-level cyanogenic compounds or environmental contaminants
	•	Communications with contractors, consumer product companies, or federal agencies regarding the distribution of pit-based scrubs as continuity props in personal care markets
	•	Reports evaluating cosmetic exfoliants as a vector for dermal microtears, permeability modulation, or entrainment-related compliance testing
	•	Analyses linking cosmetic use of ground apricot pits to continuity theater frameworks or population-level behavioral modeling

Keywords: apricot scrub, pit exfoliant, continuity theater, environmental exposure vector, amygdalin, dermal microtears, DHS, DoD, FDA, behavioral futures
