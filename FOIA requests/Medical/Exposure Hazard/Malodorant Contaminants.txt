To FDA / USDA / NIH / Department of Defense / DARPA

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, contracts, or internal communications concerning the use of airborne malodorants (including indole, skatole, and related nitrogen-containing volatiles) and masking volatiles (including corn-derived compounds such as pyrazines and aldehydes) in commercial food service or retail environments, from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Studies on the behavioral or neurological effects of subthreshold malodorant exposure in food retail environments
	•	Research on masking volatiles derived from roasted corn, coffee, or other Maillard products to conceal malodorant presence
	•	Contracts or collaborations with commercial food chains or consumer product companies testing airborne odor layering for behavioral entrainment, dwell-time modification, or consumer psychology research
	•	Internal communications regarding risk assessments or ethical reviews of exposing the public to malodorant/masking blends in restaurants, cafés, or other enclosed public spaces
	•	Reports on use of odorants for dual purposes, including crowd control or attrition modeling, with food environments as cover or test beds

Keywords: indole, skatole, malodorant, pyrazines, corn volatiles, aldehydes, odor masking, food retail, consumer entrainment, Starbucks, grocery store popcorn kiosk, behavioral psychology, DARPA non-lethal weapons

To Department of Energy (DOE) / Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) / Department of Homeland Security (DHS) / Department of Defense (DOD)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, contracts, or internal communications concerning the use of odorants or masking volatiles delivered through residential heating, natural gas, or HVAC systems for behavioral, neurological, or public health purposes, from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Studies on the psychological or physiological effects of odorant additives in residential heating fuels or HVAC air streams
	•	Research on malodorants (including indole, skatole, and related nitrogenous volatiles) or masking compounds (e.g., pyrazines, aldehydes from corn or coffee derivatives) distributed via utility systems
	•	Contracts or collaborations with utility companies, HVAC manufacturers, or odorant suppliers regarding experimental or dual-use odorant deployment beyond leak detection
	•	Internal communications concerning population-level exposure modeling, entrainment, or attrition linked to odorant distribution in residential environments
	•	Risk assessments, ethical reviews, or incident reports relating to behavioral odorant use in home heating or ventilation systems

Keywords: residential odorant, HVAC additives, natural gas odorization, indole, skatole, pyrazines, corn volatiles, masking agents, behavioral entrainment, DOE utility contracts, EPA air quality
