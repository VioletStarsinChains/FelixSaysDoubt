Request:

Requesting any and all contracts, grant proposals, technical reports, laboratory analyses, risk assessments, adverse event summaries, incident reports, program evaluations, and internal or interagency communications from 1990 to present regarding contaminant uptake and bioaccumulation in psilocybin‑producing mushrooms (and comparator edible/medicinal fungi) cultivated on compost, manure, biosolids, or other organic substrates, including downstream neurotoxic and immunotoxic effects in animal or human subjects and any dual‑use risk assessments.

This includes:
	•	Studies of heavy metal accumulation (e.g., lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic) and transport across the blood–brain barrier following ingestion of contaminated mushroom tissue
	•	Analyses of pesticide/herbicide residues, PFAS, microplastics, and industrial chemicals in fruiting bodies grown on compost or biosolids
	•	Co‑contaminant risks from co-colonizing fungi (e.g., aflatoxin, ochratoxin, other mycotoxins) and bacterial endotoxin/exotoxin carryover from substrates
	•	Method development/validation for substrate sterilization, QC testing, and release specifications in research or clinical contexts (including GMP/GLP documentation, if applicable)
	•	Animal or human exposure studies on neuroinflammation, cytokine signaling, cognitive/psychiatric sequelae, and potential synergistic effects between contaminants and serotonergic agents (psilocybin/psilocin)
	•	Clinical trial or program files noting adverse events attributed to substrate or product contamination in psychedelic or comparator mushroom research
	•	DoD/NIH memoranda and dual‑use reviews addressing deliberate or inadvertent modulation of psychedelic outcomes via substrate contaminants
	•	Procurement standards, SOWs, or contract specs for substrates, compost, or biosolids used in federally funded mushroom research, including source vetting and contaminant limits

Keywords: psilocybin mushrooms, contaminant bioaccumulation, heavy metals, mycotoxins, biosolids compost, PFAS/microplastics, endotoxin exposure, neurotoxicity, blood–brain barrier, substrate sterilization, dual‑use risk, adverse events

Request:

Requesting any and all contracts, laboratory analyses, regulatory filings, enforcement actions, adverse event reports, internal communications, interagency memoranda, or program evaluations regarding contaminant uptake and bioaccumulation in psilocybin-producing mushrooms cultivated under licensed programs or within Oregon jurisdiction, from 2015 to present.

This includes:
	•	Testing standards, QC protocols, and lab results for heavy metals, pesticides, herbicides, PFAS, microplastics, or other contaminants in psilocybin mushrooms or substrates
	•	Communications regarding compost, manure, or biosolids as substrates, and associated risks of toxin or pathogen transfer into mushrooms
	•	Reports of adverse events or complaints linked to contaminated psilocybin products (licensed or gray market)
	•	ODA/OHA correspondence on allowable soil amendments, fertilizers, or compost inputs for mushroom cultivation
	•	DEQ evaluations or guidance on the use of waste streams or biosolids in psilocybin production
	•	Interagency or vendor communications discussing the neurotoxic or immunotoxic potential of contaminants bioaccumulated in psilocybin mushrooms

Requesting any and all contracts, laboratory analyses, regulatory filings, enforcement actions, adverse event reports, internal communications, interagency memoranda, or program evaluations regarding contaminant uptake and bioaccumulation in psilocybin-producing mushrooms cultivated, distributed, or regulated under Colorado law, from 2015 to present.

This includes:
	•	Testing standards, QC protocols, and lab results for heavy metals, pesticides, herbicides, PFAS, microplastics, or other contaminants in psilocybin mushrooms or substrates
