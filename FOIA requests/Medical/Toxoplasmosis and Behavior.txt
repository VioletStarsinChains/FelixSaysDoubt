Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, internal communications, contracts, memoranda, or reports from 2000 to present referencing Toxoplasma gondii in the context of:
	•	Agricultural waste streams, including diversion of unsellable grapes, raisins, and other fruit byproducts into compost or animal feed
	•	Surveillance of T. gondii contamination in compost, recycled soil amendments, or food supply chains
	•	Role of feral or domestic cats in waste/recycling environments connected to agricultural byproducts
	•	Potential transmission pathways of T. gondii to humans via soil, compost, or food supply reuse
	•	Neurological, behavioral, or immunological effects of T. gondii exposure in humans or animals
	•	Contracts or collaborative research agreements between federal agencies, universities, or agribusinesses regarding T. gondii and agricultural waste reuse
	•	Links between T. gondii surveillance/exposure and behavioral futures markets, predictive modeling, or behavioral risk assessment

Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, internal communications, contracts, memoranda, or reports from 2000 to present referencing Toxoplasma gondii in the context of:
	•	Use of T. gondii infection patterns or neurological effects as inputs to behavioral prediction systems or behavioral futures markets
	•	Deliberate seeding, monitoring, or tracking of T. gondii in agricultural waste streams, compost, or animal feed for the purpose of human exposure modeling
	•	Links between T. gondii infection, risk-taking behaviors, and susceptibility to recruitment or manipulation in social, political, or economic contexts
	•	Federal or contractor studies assessing T. gondii’s potential role in nudging decision-making, compliance, or aggression levels
	•	Integration of parasitic infection models into predictive algorithms for population-level behavior forecasting
	•	Interagency communications or partnerships with agribusiness, compost companies, or animal feed distributors related to T. gondii surveillance or behavioral research
	•	Any references to T. gondii within Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) or similar frameworks for monitoring/managing at-risk populations
