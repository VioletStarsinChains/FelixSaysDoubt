To: DARPA / Department of Defense / Department of Energy / DHS Science & Technology Directorate / CIA Directorate of Science and Technology / DIA

Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, technical reports, internal communications, contractor deliverables, and interagency correspondence from January 1, 2005 to present concerning the interaction of environmental temperature manipulation with cavitation, bubble formation, or neurophysiological entrainment in human or animal models.

This includes:
	•	Studies on gas solubility, cavitation thresholds, or embolism risk under elevated ambient temperatures or enclosed/contained conditions
	•	Experiments with thermal entrainment (use of high heat, sauna-like environments, or sealed rooms/bags) for physiological or psychological effects
	•	Research into containment vessels, enclosures, or duffel-style bags as part of controlled exposure protocols
	•	Safety thresholds, after-action reports, or adverse event documentation for heat + cavitation co-exposure
	•	Communications or liaisons with UK defense or intelligence agencies on environmental entrainment, containment, or cavitation lethality

Keywords: thermal entrainment, cavitation lethality, gas solubility heat interaction, environmental containment testing, duffel bag protocol, neurophysiological entrainment, heat stress cavitation

Spicy Version (containment-as-NPE / staged accident protocols)

To: Department of Justice / DHS / FBI / CIA Directorate of Operations / NSA / DIA

Request:

Requesting any and all records from January 1, 2005 to present regarding the use of staged accidents, containment rituals, or plausibly deniable suicide scenarios in intelligence or counterintelligence operations.

This includes:
	•	Training materials, manuals, or operational guidelines on “plausible accident staging” or “containment rituals” (e.g., sealed bags, locked containers, overheated rooms)
	•	After-action reports or assessments evaluating law enforcement, coroner, or public perception in response to anomalous deaths
	•	Interagency communications with UK intelligence regarding the 2010 death of Gareth Williams, specifically referencing containment, accident staging, or suicide misadventure cover stories
	•	Contractor deliverables or liaison notes on NPE (Non-Person Entity) classification metaphors enacted physically (bagging, sealing, etc.) in high-profile cases
	•	Oversight, OIG, or inspector reviews of deaths presented as self-inflicted but occurring under highly controlled or anomalous conditions

Keywords: staged accident, containment ritual, duffel bag protocol, NPE classification, plausible suicide, anomalous death cover, Gareth Williams, accident staging, counterintelligence neutralization
