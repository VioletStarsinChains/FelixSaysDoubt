To Department of Defense / DARPA / U.S. Navy / Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate (JNLWD)

Request:

Requesting any and all technical reports, research proposals, internal communications, or vendor contracts from January 1, 1990 to present concerning the use of cavitation phenomena as a mechanism for incapacitation or lethality in human or animal subjects.

This includes:
	•	Studies on cavitation induced by ultrasound, infrasound, directed energy, or electromagnetic methods
	•	Evaluations of cavitation as a non-lethal deterrent versus as a potential kill mechanism
	•	Safety assessments, risk-benefit analyses, or medical reviews of cavitation effects on brain, lung, or vascular tissues
	•	Interagency communications or briefings on the potential for cavitation to be used in crowd control, counterinsurgency, or covert operations
	•	Contracts or research partnerships with private sector vendors exploring cavitation for defense, intelligence, or law enforcement applications

Keywords: cavitation weapons, ultrasonic cavitation, infrasound lethality, directed energy cavitation, acoustic weapons, JNLWD, DARPA, non-lethal deterrent, crowd control, covert incapacitation

To National Institutes of Health (NIH) / Food and Drug Administration (FDA) / National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)

Request:

Requesting any and all studies, internal communications, grant proposals, or regulatory evaluations from January 1, 1990 to present concerning the effects of cavitation phenomena on human or animal health.

This includes:
	•	Research on ultrasound- or infrasound-induced cavitation and its potential for tissue damage in medical or consumer contexts
	•	Safety assessments of cavitation in diagnostic ultrasound, lithotripsy, or other therapeutic devices
	•	Reports of adverse events or complications linked to cavitation in FDA-regulated medical products
	•	NIST or interagency evaluations of cavitation as an occupational or environmental hazard (e.g. industrial ultrasound, sonar, or energy systems)
	•	Communications regarding standards development, measurement techniques, or exposure thresholds for cavitation effects on biological tissues

Keywords: cavitation effects, ultrasound safety, infrasound exposure, lithotripsy risks, acoustic cavitation, FDA adverse events, NIST standards, NIH medical research, consumer protection, non-ionizing energy safety
