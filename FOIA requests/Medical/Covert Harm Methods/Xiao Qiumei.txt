DARPA / Department of Defense / U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command (USAMRDC) / DHS Science & Technology Directorate / Department of Justice / FBI / CIA Directorate of Science and Technology

Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, technical reports, contracts, internal memoranda, interagency correspondence, or oversight reviews from January 1, 2000 to present concerning the use of neurotechnology, directed energy, or other remote modulation techniques to induce neuromotor disruption, balance loss, or falls in human or animal subjects.

This includes:
	•	Studies on motor cortex entrainment, gait interference, or vestibular disruption through acoustic, electromagnetic, or cavitation-based means
	•	Experiments involving sudden loss of grip, destabilization, or induced falls as measurable endpoints
	•	Records on the potential for trafficking or operational misuse of neuromotor disruption technologies in occupational, industrial, or protest settings
	•	After-action reports or safety data from DARPA, DoD, DHS, or CIA field trials referencing induced loss of balance, collapse, or fall-related injury
	•	Oversight or Inspector General reviews on dual-use risks (e.g., covert incapacitation vs. therapeutic neurostimulation)
	•	Communications with foreign governments or contractors referencing induced falls, neuromotor disruption, or “silent incapacitation” methods

Keywords: neuromotor disruption, induced falls, gait interference, vestibular entrainment, neurotech trafficking, directed energy balance loss, occupational destabilization, silent incapacitation, DARPA motor control, induced collapse
