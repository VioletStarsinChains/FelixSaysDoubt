To: Federal Communications Commission (FCC) / Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) / U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) / Local Public Utility Commission

Request:

Requesting any and all records, memoranda, internal communications, contractor documentation, or interagency coordination logs regarding the concurrent use of utility smart meters and low-altitude aircraft flight operations to induce or study physiological responses in human subjects, from January 1, 2010 to present.

This includes:
	•	Records of coordinated timing between RF emissions from smart meters and aircraft flyovers
	•	Technical specifications describing RF burst patterns capable of eliciting nausea, vomiting, or vestibular disruption
	•	Interagency or contractor communications discussing synchronization of utility infrastructure with aerial assets for behavioral or physiological monitoring
	•	Reports, assessments, or pilot studies describing public health impacts of simultaneous EM and acoustic/vibrational exposure
	•	Incident reports, citizen complaints, or whistleblower statements linking aircraft activity and smart meter emissions to acute illness
	•	Any research proposals, grants, or subcontractor work related to “multi-modal stimulus” or “layered environmental exposure” using both ground-based and aerial sources
	•	Agreements or MOUs between utilities and aviation entities involving public or private airspace over residential areas in connection with meter operation schedules

Keywords: smart meter RF, aircraft flyover, EMF vestibular, nausea induction, synchronized emissions, multi-modal exposure, behavioral entrainment, DOE FAA coordination, public utility EMF
