To: Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) / Food and Drug Administration (FDA) / National Institutes of Health (NIH)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, reports, or internal communications concerning the intersection of eating disorders (including anorexia nervosa and restrictive eating behaviors) and acceptable daily intake (ADI) standards for chemicals, additives, or contaminants, from January 1, 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Research proposals or findings describing how restrictive eating patterns may alter exposure, metabolism, or risk assessments for chemicals subject to ADI thresholds
	•	Internal analyses, contractor deliverables, or interagency communications on whether individuals with anorexia or chronic caloric restriction were studied as special populations in ADI determinations
	•	Reports or reviews documenting behavioral nudging, dietary interventions, or experimental designs where participants were guided into restrictive eating patterns to evaluate chemical intake or toxicology outcomes
	•	Ethics board reviews, IRB submissions, or compliance evaluations addressing the appropriateness of using eating-disordered populations in ADI-related research
	•	Policy documents or communications regarding the public health implications of disordered eating on cumulative exposure, safety margins, or regulatory thresholds

Keywords: anorexia, eating disorders, acceptable daily intake, ADI standards, restrictive eating, exposure thresholds, chemical toxicology, FDA, NIH, HHS, behavioral nudging

EPA Version

To: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) / Office of Research and Development (ORD) / Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention (OCSPP)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, reports, or internal communications concerning the role of eating disorders (including anorexia nervosa and restrictive eating behaviors) in chemical exposure modeling and acceptable daily intake (ADI) standards, from January 1, 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Toxicological risk assessments or population modeling documents addressing how caloric restriction or low body weight may alter exposure levels to chemicals regulated under EPA authority
	•	Research proposals or contractor deliverables describing the use of eating-disordered or malnourished populations in evaluating chemical intake, bioaccumulation, or dose-response thresholds
	•	Communications or reports concerning whether restrictive eating behaviors affect safety margins, uncertainty factors, or the validity of ADI thresholds
	•	Interagency or contractor analyses on behavioral nudging, dietary simulations, or attrition models that intersect with EPA chemical safety standards
	•	Ethics board reviews or policy discussions on the appropriateness of incorporating disordered eating populations in chemical toxicology datasets

Keywords: anorexia, eating disorders, acceptable daily intake, ADI, toxicology, EPA, chemical exposure, restricted diet, dose-response, ORD, OCSPP

USDA Version

To: U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) / Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) / Agricultural Research Service (ARS)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, research proposals, or communications concerning the interaction of eating disorders (including anorexia nervosa and restrictive eating behaviors) with dietary intake standards, fortification programs, or nutrient risk assessments, from January 1, 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Research proposals or findings examining how restrictive eating alters nutrient exposure, tolerable upper intake levels (ULs), or acceptable daily intake calculations for fortified foods
	•	Reports or contractor deliverables describing disordered eating as a variable in USDA nutrition surveillance, dietary guidelines, or food safety risk assessments
	•	Communications concerning the use of restrictive or disordered eating populations in evaluating fortification efficacy, safety margins, or cumulative dietary exposure to additives or micronutrients
	•	Ethics or compliance reviews related to the inclusion of eating-disordered subjects in USDA food fortification or dietary modeling studies
	•	Policy discussions or internal communications regarding the role of restrictive eating behaviors in shaping population-wide intake assumptions

Keywords: anorexia, eating disorders, acceptable daily intake, fortified foods, USDA, nutrient exposure, dietary guidelines, FNS, ARS, restricted diet
