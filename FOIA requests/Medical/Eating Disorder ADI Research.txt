Request:

Requesting any and all records, reports, or internal communications concerning the intersection of eating disorders (including anorexia nervosa and restrictive eating behaviors) and acceptable daily intake (ADI) standards for chemicals, additives, or contaminants, from January 1, 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Research proposals or findings describing how restrictive eating patterns may alter exposure, metabolism, or risk assessments for chemicals subject to ADI thresholds
	•	Internal analyses, contractor deliverables, or interagency communications on whether individuals with anorexia or chronic caloric restriction were studied as special populations in ADI determinations
	•	Reports or reviews documenting behavioral nudging, dietary interventions, or experimental designs where participants were guided into restrictive eating patterns to evaluate chemical intake or toxicology outcomes
	•	Ethics board reviews, IRB submissions, or compliance evaluations addressing the appropriateness of using eating-disordered populations in ADI-related research
	•	Policy documents or communications regarding the public health implications of disordered eating on cumulative exposure, safety margins, or regulatory thresholds

Keywords: anorexia, eating disorders, acceptable daily intake, ADI standards, restrictive eating, exposure thresholds, chemical toxicology, FDA, NIH, HHS, behavioral nudging
