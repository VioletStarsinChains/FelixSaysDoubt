To Food and Drug Administration (FDA) / National Institutes of Health (NIH) / Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) / Department of Defense (DoD) / Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, internal communications, or research proposals from January 1, 2000 to present concerning the use of nanocoatings, biomaterial encapsulation, or advanced preservation technologies in relation to reproductive health products or biologic material viability.

This includes:
	•	Research into the potential for nanocoatings or similar technologies to preserve the viability of reproductive cells (e.g., sperm or ova) under non-laboratory conditions
	•	Contracts, proposals, or internal reports concerning the use of nanotechnology in tampons, pads, contraceptives, or other consumer health products
	•	Regulatory filings or risk assessments addressing the potential misuse of nanocoatings or biomaterials in ways that could impact reproductive autonomy or safety
	•	Interagency communications on ethical, legal, or consumer protection implications of reproductive biomaterial preservation technologies embedded in consumer products
	•	Investigations, audits, or safety reviews related to emerging reproductive health technologies involving encapsulation, delayed release, or biologic preservation

Keywords: nanocoatings, biomaterial encapsulation, reproductive health, consumer safety, biologic preservation, tampon technology, contraceptive device oversight, DARPA nanotechnology, reproductive autonomy, FDA product safety
