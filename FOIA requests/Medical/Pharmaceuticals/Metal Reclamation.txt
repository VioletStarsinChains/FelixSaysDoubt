FOIA – Biomedical Research on Tissue Metal Deposition

To: NIH (NIDDK, NIEHS, NHLBI) / HHS / FDA (CDER, CDRH)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, research grants, contracts, or interagency communications from 2000 to present concerning the accumulation, storage, or mis-regulation of metals in human soft tissues (muscle, connective tissue, skin, vasculature, organs).

This includes:
	•	Studies on abnormal deposition of biologically relevant metals (iron, copper, zinc, magnesium, manganese) in soft tissue
	•	Reports on toxic deposition of environmental or industrial metals (aluminum, lead, cadmium, nickel, cobalt, rare earth elements)
	•	Clinical trial data, animal models, or mechanistic studies linking inflammation, fibrosis, or calcification to tissue metal sequestration
	•	Evaluations of therapeutic interventions (e.g., vitamin K2, chelators, anti-fibrotic drugs, GLP-1 agonists) for mobilizing or redistributing tissue metal deposits
	•	Safety assessments regarding systemic release of metals during fibrosis/calcification reversal therapies

Keywords: soft tissue mineralization, fibrosis, metal deposition, iron overload, copper accumulation, zinc, manganese, aluminum, rare earth elements, chelation therapy, MK-4, GLP-1

FOIA (Spicy Angle – Tissue Metal Storage & Tech Supply Chains)

To: Department of Defense (DoD) / Department of Energy (DOE) / DARPA / Department of Homeland Security (DHS)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, contracts, reports, or internal analyses from 2000 to present concerning the overlap between human soft-tissue metal storage (calcification, fibrosis, mineral sequestration) and supply-chain vulnerabilities in strategic technologies (semiconductors, batteries, magnets, renewable energy infrastructure).

This includes:
	•	Records describing soft-tissue sequestration of critical minerals (copper, zinc, manganese, cobalt, nickel, rare earth elements) and their impact on national resource availability
	•	Analyses of therapeutic or experimental protocols (e.g., K2, chelators, anti-fibrotic agents, GLP-1 agonists) that could accelerate metal mobilization from human tissue
	•	Communications linking biomedical research on metal sequestration to defense/energy strategic mineral planning
	•	Reports evaluating whether population-scale health interventions (e.g., fibrosis reversal) could influence availability of metals otherwise scarce for defense and technology applications
	•	Continuity-theater frameworks framing tissue metal storage as latent “hidden reserves”

Keywords: continuity theater, tissue metals, strategic minerals, copper, cobalt, nickel, rare earths, national security, supply-chain vulnerability, DARPA, DOE, DoD
