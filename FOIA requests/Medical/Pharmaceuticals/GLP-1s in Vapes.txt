To FDA (Center for Tobacco Products; Center for Drug Evaluation & Research; Center for Devices & Radiological Health; Office of Regulatory Affairs) / NIH (incl. NIDA) / CDC (Office on Smoking & Health)

Request:

Requesting any and all records from 2005 to present regarding the formulation, testing, regulation, or surveillance of GLP-1 receptor agonists (or GLP-1–like peptides) delivered via e-cigarettes, vapes, or inhaled aerosols, including research proposals, contracts, grant files, laboratory analyses, inspection/enforcement records, adverse event summaries, premarket submissions, interagency communications, and vendor/manufacturer correspondence.

This includes:
	•	Research proposals, grants, contracts, or white papers on pulmonary or intranasal delivery of GLP-1 analogs via e-liquids, cartridges, or aerosol devices (including low-temperature/ceramic coils and ultrasonic nebulizers).
	•	FDA submissions and reviews (e.g., PMTA/MRTP files, investigational device/drug records) referencing peptide, polypeptide, incretin, or GLP-1 content in vape products or accessories.
	•	Analytical methods and lab results on aerosol stability, thermal degradation, and bioavailability of GLP-1 analogs in propylene glycol/vegetable glycerin (PG/VG) or other carriers (e.g., PEG, liposomes, lipid nanoparticles).
	•	Toxicology/pharmacokinetic assessments, human factors testing, or behavioral outcomes studies involving low-dose/microdosed GLP-1 delivered by consumer aerosol devices.
	•	Inspection, import, or enforcement records (ORA/field labs) identifying peptide-containing e-liquids or cartridges; seizure/testing reports; compliance actions.
	•	Adverse event reports or safety signal evaluations (FDA/CDC) citing GLP-1–like effects (e.g., rapid satiety, nausea, delayed gastric emptying) temporally associated with vape use.
	•	Interagency communications (FDA–NIH/NIDA–CDC) and correspondence with universities, CROs, or manufacturers concerning dual-use or behavioral modulation implications of GLP-1 aerosol delivery in consumer products.
