To: U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) / National Institutes of Health (NIH) / Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, internal communications, clinical trial data, safety reviews, or interagency correspondence from January 1, 1990 to present concerning the non-gastrointestinal physiological and neurobehavioral effects of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) in human subjects.

This includes:
	•	Internal studies or literature reviews on PPIs’ effects on magnesium depletion, immune function, and neurological health
	•	Risk-benefit analyses considering long-term autonomic dysregulation, altered vagal tone, or histamine signaling changes in chronic PPI users
	•	Research into potential use of PPIs as adjuncts in behavioral conditioning, cognitive suppression, or sensory dampening
	•	Communications between FDA, NIH, CMS, and pharmaceutical companies regarding side effects not disclosed in public-facing materials
	•	Reports, adverse event data, or whistleblower testimony indicating intentional underreporting of mineral depletion, neuroimmune effects, or psychiatric impacts
	•	Funding proposals, contracts, or subcontracts for studies examining PPIs’ impact on susceptibility to environmental stressors or toxins
	•	Any evaluation of PPIs’ influence on patient compliance, emotional flattening, or reduced physiological resilience

Keywords: proton pump inhibitor, PPI magnesium depletion, neurobehavioral modulation, histamine suppression, vagal tone alteration, immune modulation, compliance drug, FDA adverse event, long-term suppression therapy

To: U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) / Federal Communications Commission (FCC) / Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) / U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) / Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) / National Institutes of Health (NIH) / Relevant State Public Utility Commissions

Request:

Requesting any and all records, memoranda, interagency correspondence, contractor reports, or research proposals from January 1, 1990 to present concerning the coordinated use of environmental exposures and pharmaceutical interventions to influence, condition, or monitor human physiological and behavioral responses.

This includes, but is not limited to:
	•	Environmental Exposure Synchronization:
	•	Coordination between RF emissions from utility smart meters and low-altitude aircraft operations to induce or study acute illness (nausea, vomiting, vestibular disruption)
	•	Technical specifications describing synchronized or “layered” EM and acoustic/vibrational exposure patterns
	•	Interagency or contractor communications linking utility infrastructure operation schedules with aerial asset flight paths over residential areas
	•	Incident reports, citizen complaints, or whistleblower statements on combined environmental stimulus events
	•	Pharmaceutical Modulation:
	•	Internal studies on proton pump inhibitors’ (PPIs) non-gastrointestinal effects, including magnesium depletion, histamine suppression, immune modulation, and vagal tone alteration
	•	Risk-benefit analyses and communications regarding PPIs’ potential to reduce physiological resilience, dampen sensory perception, or influence emotional/behavioral compliance
	•	Evidence of PPIs’ use in conjunction with environmental stressors to amplify or prolong physiological effects
	•	Contracts, subcontracts, or funding proposals for studies combining pharmaceutical suppression with environmental stimuli
	•	Cross-Domain Integration:
	•	Records showing strategic pairing of pharmaceutical agents and environmental exposure technologies for public health surveillance, compliance conditioning, or covert research
	•	Communications between FDA, FCC, FAA, DOE, CMS, NIH, utilities, and pharmaceutical manufacturers discussing multi-modal interventions or “compliance anchors”
	•	Adverse event data or internal assessments not released to the public that connect these domains

Keywords: smart meter RF, aircraft flyover, EMF vestibular disruption, multi-modal exposure, proton pump inhibitor, magnesium depletion, neurobehavioral modulation, histamine suppression, compliance drug, environmental-pharmaceutical pairing, DOE FAA FCC FDA NIH coordination
