Request:

Requesting any and all records from January 1, 2019 to present that reference, compare, evaluate, or otherwise discuss both COVID‑19 vaccines (including mRNA and adenoviral‑vector platforms) and GLP‑1/incretin‑based therapies (e.g., semaglutide, tirzepatide, liraglutide, dulaglutide, exenatide), without limiting the form or context of the connection.

This includes:
	•	Pharmacovigilance analyses, signal detection crosswalks, or comparative safety reviews that analyze overlapping adverse event patterns across COVID‑19 vaccines and GLP‑1/incretin therapies (e.g., GI dysmotility, pancreatitis, biliary events, dysautonomia, myocarditis/arrhythmia, kidney injury).
	•	Briefing memos, meeting minutes, emails, slide decks, or decision documents considering coadministration, sequencing, or timing of GLP‑1 therapy relative to COVID‑19 vaccination, including any immunogenicity or reactogenicity considerations.
	•	Research proposals, protocols, grants, OTAs/CRADAs, or contractor deliverables examining GLP‑1/incretin effects on immune function, vaccine response, inflammation, fibrosis/remodeling, or autonomic outcomes in post‑viral or vaccinated cohorts.
	•	Internal or interagency communications addressing supply‑chain integrity, cold‑chain logistics, labeling/lot control, or product integrity risk assessments where COVID‑19 vaccines and GLP‑1/incretin products are mentioned together (e.g., mix‑up prevention, counterfeiting surveillance, track‑and‑trace discussions).
	•	Guidance, FAQs, safety communications, or provider education discussing management of adverse events or differential diagnosis when patients have exposure histories to both product classes.
	•	Correspondence with manufacturers (e.g., Pfizer, Moderna, Janssen; Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly, AstraZeneca) that references both COVID‑19 vaccines and GLP‑1/incretin therapies in the same context, including attachments.
	•	Data extracts, dashboards, or analyses from VAERS, VSD, Sentinel, CMS, VA, or DoD datasets where variables for vaccination status and GLP‑1/incretin therapy status are modeled together, referenced, or stratified.
	•	Records concerning product coding (e.g., NDC/lot), barcoding/UDI, or pharmacovigilance case definitions that address methods for distinguishing signals or preventing attribution errors when both product classes are in scope.

Request:

Requesting any and all records from January 1, 2010 to present concerning GLP‑1 receptor agonists and related incretin therapies (e.g., semaglutide, tirzepatide, liraglutide, dulaglutide, exenatide) and their interactions with micronutrient/mineral deficiency, malnutrition, or cofactor depletion, including impacts on tissue remodeling/fibrosis, autonomic function, and organ injury.

This includes:
	•	Internal safety reviews, pharmacovigilance signal analyses, and case series where mineral or cofactor status (e.g., magnesium, potassium, thiamine/B1, B6, B12, vitamin K/K2, zinc) was captured, modeled, or considered a covariate.
	•	Clinical guidance, labeling discussions, risk management plans, or protocols recommending (or rejecting) screening/supplementation for mineral/cofactor status before or during GLP‑1 therapy.
	•	Funding opportunity announcements, RFPs, OTAs, CRADAs, grant applications, protocols, and IRB materials for studies examining GLP‑1 effects under “nutrient stress,” malnutrition, or post‑viral states (including COVID‑19 cohorts).
	•	Communications (emails, meeting minutes, slide decks) with drug manufacturers (e.g., Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly) referencing mineral/cofactor deficiency, malnutrition, or dehydration risks in relation to GLP‑1 therapies.
	•	Postmarketing surveillance reports, EHR‑ or claims‑based analyses (CMS/VA/DoD), and adverse event trend memos stratified by nutritional status or rapid weight change.
	•	Records discussing incidence/severity of pancreatitis, cholelithiasis/cholangitis, gastroparesis, acute kidney injury, dysautonomia/arrhythmia, myocardial or other tissue fibrosis/calcification in patients with known or suspected mineral/cofactor deficiency.
	•	Any modeling, decision memos, or briefing papers weighing labeling changes, boxed warnings, REMS elements, or mitigation strategies specific to deficient mineral/cofactor states.

Keywords: GLP‑1 agonist, semaglutide, tirzepatide, micronutrient deficiency, magnesium deficiency, thiamine deficiency, gastroparesis, pancreatitis, cholelithiasis, acute kidney injury, fibrosis remodeling, dysautonomia, dehydration

Request:

Requesting any and all records from December 1, 2020 to present regarding shortages, allocation decisions, or supply chain disruptions of GLP-1 receptor agonists and related incretin therapies (e.g., semaglutide, tirzepatide, liraglutide, dulaglutide, exenatide).

This includes:
	•	Internal FDA drug shortage monitoring reports, enforcement actions, or interagency briefings on GLP-1 product availability.
	•	Manufacturer communications, distribution logs, or correspondence related to production capacity, allocation, or backorders.
	•	Records discussing prioritization of patient populations (e.g., type 2 diabetes vs. obesity), rationing strategies, or substitution protocols.
	•	Analyses of global supply chain vulnerabilities for GLP-1 products, including active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), raw materials, cold-chain logistics, or fill/finish bottlenecks.
	•	Contracts, CRADAs, task orders, or funding awards related to scaling manufacturing capacity for GLP-1 therapies.
	•	CMS, VA, or DoD memoranda on formulary management, rationing, or reimbursement adjustments due to constrained GLP-1 supply.
	•	Reports, dashboards, or adverse event monitoring documents where shortages, delayed treatment, or forced substitutions are noted as contributing factors.
	•	Interagency or manufacturer discussions of counterfeiting, diversion, or illicit markets arising from limited GLP-1 supply.
