To Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) / National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) / Food and Drug Administration (FDA)

Request:

Requesting any and all investigative records, laboratory analyses, research proposals, interagency communications, or enforcement reports from 2010 to present concerning the appearance, distribution, or mislabeling of GLP-1 receptor agonists (or GLP-1–like analogues) in online/dark web drug marketplaces (e.g., Silk Road, AlphaBay, Dream Market, Hydra, and successor platforms).

This includes:
	•	Toxicology reports or forensic laboratory findings indicating GLP-1 analogues present in substances marketed as opioids, stimulants, benzodiazepines, or “diet/weight-loss aids.”
	•	Internal or contractor analyses on the possibility of GLP-1 microdosing in counterfeit pills or powders sold via dark web channels.
	•	Interagency communications (DEA, FDA, NIDA, CDC, DHS) regarding misattribution of GLP-1 effects as fentanyl or other synthetic opioid overdoses.
	•	Research projects or monitoring pilots funded by NIDA on behavioral or metabolic outcomes linked to GLP-1s in illicit drug contexts.
	•	Enforcement case files, seizures, or undercover operations that identified non-opioid pharmacology (GLP-1 or similar metabolic regulators) misrepresented as controlled substances.
	•	Data-sharing agreements with universities or toxicology labs tasked with screening seized substances for GLP-1–like activity.

Keywords: GLP-1 analogue, semaglutide, liraglutide, exenatide, dulaglutide, tirzepatide, Silk Road, AlphaBay, Dream Market, Hydra, dark web, darknet, fentanyl misattribution, counterfeit diet pills, metabolic regulators, DEA, NIDA
