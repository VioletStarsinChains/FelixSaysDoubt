FOIA Request: Embolic Events in GLP-1 Users

To: Food and Drug Administration (FDA – Center for Drug Evaluation and Research), National Institutes of Health (NIH – National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC – National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, reports, adverse event databases, contracts, or internal communications from 2005 to present concerning embolism, gas embolism, unexplained vascular occlusion, or sudden embolic death associated with GLP-1 receptor agonist use (including but not limited to semaglutide, liraglutide, dulaglutide, exenatide, and related compounds).

This includes:
	•	Adverse event reporting data (FAERS, MedWatch, or internal datasets) concerning embolic events in GLP-1 users
	•	Internal analyses or safety reviews examining rare vascular or embolic outcomes associated with these medications
	•	Contracts or grants with universities or contractors studying embolic events or fibrotic tissue remodeling under GLP-1 exposure
	•	Communications between FDA, NIH, or CDC staff regarding possible mechanisms linking GLP-1 receptor agonists to unexplained vascular occlusions or deaths
	•	Mortality or morbidity reports classifying embolic events in patients prescribed GLP-1 therapies

Keywords: GLP-1 receptor agonist, semaglutide, liraglutide, dulaglutide, exenatide, embolism, vascular occlusion, sudden death, fibrotic tissue remodeling

This includes:
	•	Mortality and morbidity surveillance data related to embolic events in military or veteran populations receiving GLP-1 therapies
	•	Internal analyses or safety reviews evaluating the potential association between GLP-1 use and vascular occlusion or embolic death
	•	Contracts or collaborations with universities or private contractors investigating rare vascular outcomes associated with GLP-1 therapies in service members or veterans
	•	Communications between DoD, VA, and FDA/CDC concerning monitoring of unexplained embolic outcomes in GLP-1-treated populations
	•	Reports or summaries produced by the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Division addressing embolic or vascular complications in GLP-1 users
