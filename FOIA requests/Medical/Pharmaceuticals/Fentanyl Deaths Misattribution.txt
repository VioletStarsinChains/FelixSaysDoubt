To U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) / National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)

Request:

Requesting any and all toxicology reports, research analyses, interagency communications, or oversight reviews from 2000 to present concerning cases where fentanyl was listed as a cause of death or overdose event without confirmatory detection of fentanyl metabolites or analogues in toxicological testing.

This includes:
	•	Internal reviews or laboratory reports noting negative or inconclusive opioid metabolite results in cases initially attributed to fentanyl.
	•	Research analyses or pilot projects evaluating whether other substances (e.g., GLP-1 agonists, metabolic disruptors, or novel pharmaceuticals) could produce clinical presentations or fatalities misattributed to fentanyl.
	•	Communications between DEA, NIDA, state medical examiners, or contracted laboratories regarding discrepancies between clinical symptoms and toxicology findings in fentanyl-attributed deaths.
	•	Oversight reviews or audits addressing accuracy of fentanyl-related death reporting in circumstances where confirmatory data was absent.
	•	Contractor deliverables or academic partnerships evaluating the possibility of non-opioid compounds producing fentanyl-like overdose symptoms.

Keywords: fentanyl attribution, negative opioid toxicology, inconclusive metabolite, GLP-1 agonist, misattribution, overdose reporting, DEA, NIDA
