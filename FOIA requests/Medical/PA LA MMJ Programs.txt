Pennsylvania (Right-to-Know Law – RTKL)

To Pennsylvania Department of Health (DOH) / Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) / Pennsylvania Office of the State Fire Commissioner

Request:

Requesting any and all risk assessments, policy analyses, inspection/incident reports, or internal communications concerning ignition hazards associated with open-flame cannabis use (combustion of cannabis flower) in Pennsylvania, from 2000 to present, particularly in relation to co-located hazardous materials in residential, retail, or transportation-adjacent environments.

This includes:
	•	Fire marshal reports, hazard analyses, or air-quality testing data regarding methane, hydrogen sulfide, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), or oxidizers in public or commercial facilities where smoking materials may be present
	•	Communications comparing risks of smoked cannabis vs. non-combustion cannabis products (edibles, tinctures, oils, vapes)
	•	Internal policy memos or legislative briefing documents discussing fire or explosion risk associated with cannabis flower prohibition in Pennsylvania’s medical program
	•	Incident or near-miss reports involving smoking materials as ignition sources in facilities storing compressed gases, fuels, or oxidizers
	•	Interagency correspondence between DOH, DEP, and the Office of the State Fire Commissioner regarding ignition hazards, cannabis flower restrictions, and public health safety concerns

Keywords: cannabis flower, ignition hazard, open flame, VOCs, methane, hydrogen sulfide, Pennsylvania medical marijuana, DEP, State Fire Marshal

Louisiana (Public Records Law)

To Louisiana Department of Health (LDH) / Louisiana State Fire Marshal’s Office / Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ)

Request:

Requesting any and all hazard assessments, inspection reports, internal communications, or technical studies concerning ignition risks associated with open-flame cannabis use (combustion of cannabis flower) in Louisiana, from 2000 to present, including contexts where hazardous materials may be co-located (residential, medical, retail, or transportation settings).

This includes:
	•	Fire safety analyses or hazard modeling involving methane, hydrogen sulfide, VOCs, or oxidizers in proximity to open-flame smoking materials
	•	Communications comparing fire risk between smokable cannabis flower and non-combustion cannabis products (tinctures, oils, edibles) allowed under Louisiana’s medical program
	•	Incident or near-miss reports involving smoking as an ignition source in medical, commercial, or public facilities with hazardous material storage
	•	Legislative or policy documents justifying the prohibition of smokable cannabis flower on safety or ignition-hazard grounds
	•	Interagency correspondence between LDH, DEQ, and the Louisiana State Fire Marshal regarding ignition risks tied to cannabis flower

Keywords: cannabis flower, ignition hazard, open flame, volatile organic compounds, methane, hydrogen sulfide, Louisiana medical marijuana, State Fire Marshal, DEQ

To National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) / National Fire Protection Association (NFPA – if filing public record) / Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA, U.S. DOT) / Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA, U.S. DOL) / Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

Request:

Requesting any and all hazard assessments, fire modeling studies, inspection reports, internal communications, or policy documents concerning ignition hazards associated with open-flame cannabis use (combustion of cannabis flower) in environments where hazardous materials (compressed gases, oxidizers, petroleum products, de-icing chemicals, or volatile organic compounds) may be present, from 2000 to present.

This includes:
	•	Technical studies or modeling conducted by NIST, NFPA, or PHMSA on ignition thresholds involving methane, hydrogen sulfide, CO₂, nitrogen, or VOCs in the presence of smoking materials
	•	OSHA or EPA inspection reports or incident data where smoking/lighters were identified as ignition sources in facilities with hazardous material storage or distribution
	•	Policy memoranda or legislative briefing materials comparing risks of cannabis flower combustion with those of non-combustion cannabis derivatives (edibles, beverages, tinctures, vapes)
	•	Interagency communications concerning cannabis flower prohibition or regulation tied to ignition risks in hazard-rich environments (airports, hospitals, retail food service, residential sites)
	•	Correspondence with state agencies (e.g., Minnesota MPCA/Fire Marshal, Pennsylvania DEP/Fire Commissioner, Louisiana DEQ/Fire Marshal) regarding cannabis flower ignition risks and mitigation policies

Keywords: cannabis flower, open flame, ignition hazard, VOC emissions, methane, hydrogen sulfide, compressed gases, oxidizers, NFPA 704, PHMSA, NIST, OSHA, EPA
