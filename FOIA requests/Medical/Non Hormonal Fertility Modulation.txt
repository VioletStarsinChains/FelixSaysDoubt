Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, contracts/grants (including SBIR/STTR), clinical trial materials, regulatory submissions, adverse event reports, interagency correspondence, or internal communications from January 1, 1990 to present referencing non‑hormonal, non‑implant fertility modulation or contraception using energy-based or cavitation-mediated mechanisms (e.g., ultrasound, HIFU, RF, microwave) in human or animal models.

This includes:
	•	Studies on ultrasound/HIFU- or RF-mediated fallopian tube occlusion (temporary or permanent), including cavitation- or microbubble‑assisted techniques
	•	Protocols for uterine fibroid or endometriosis ablation (HIFU/microbubble-assisted) where fertility or menstrual outcomes are measured endpoints
	•	Research on pelvic autonomic neuromodulation (acoustic or electromagnetic) targeting uterus, ovaries, cervix, or pelvic plexus for cycle regulation or contraception
	•	Safety thresholds, dosimetry, and targeting data for reproductive tissues; impacts on ovarian reserve/AMH, endometrium, tubal epithelium, and menstrual parameters
	•	Procurement, grant, or contractor records for bio‑inspired cavitation devices, microbubble/contrast agents, or portable/home acoustic devices with reproductive indications
	•	Regulatory communications (e.g., IDEs, 510(k)s, De Novo, PMA) for devices intended for non‑implant contraception via energy or cavitation, including classification and guidance drafts
	•	IRB/ethics materials, consent forms, and risk–benefit analyses referencing non‑hormonal, non‑implant contraception or noninvasive sterilization by ultrasound/RF
	•	Interagency or contractor communications on field‑deployable fertility control for humanitarian, public health, or operational contexts

Keywords: non‑hormonal contraception, ultrasound contraception, cavitation fertility modulation, microbubble‑assisted ultrasound, HIFU reproductive, fallopian tube occlusion, uterine fibroid ablation, endometriosis ablation, pelvic autonomic neuromodulation, noninvasive sterilization, reproductive dosimetry, NICHD/NIBIB CDRH

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, contracts, grant records, internal communications, interagency correspondence, or regulatory submissions from January 1, 1975 to present concerning the use of ultrasound, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), acoustic cavitation, or other energy-based modalities as methods of pregnancy termination or reproductive control in human or animal models.

This includes:
	•	Research on energy-based disruption of pregnancy distinct from surgical or pharmaceutical abortion methods
	•	Risk–benefit assessments, safety evaluations, or adverse event reports noting pregnancy loss associated with cavitation or acoustic exposure
	•	Ethical reviews, IRB submissions, or internal memoranda regarding pregnancy termination applications of energy-based technologies
	•	Communications between agencies, contractors, or academic researchers concerning reproductive control, population management, or “non-surgical abortion” concepts
	•	Records discussing the application of such methods in vulnerable or minority populations or within global health and humanitarian programs

Keywords: ultrasound abortion, non-surgical pregnancy termination, cavitation reproductive control, HIFU pregnancy disruption, acoustic abortion, energy-based sterilization, DARPA reproductive research, NICHD cavitation, population management, reproductive sabotage

Request:

Requesting any and all records from January 1, 1975 to present concerning the research, development, or consideration of ultrasound, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), acoustic cavitation, or other energy-based methods as mechanisms of pregnancy termination or reproductive control.

This request includes:
	•	Research proposals, grant awards, contracts, or pilot projects testing energy-based pregnancy disruption in animals or humans
	•	Internal communications, ethical reviews, or IRB materials referencing non-surgical or non-pharmaceutical abortion concepts
	•	Risk assessments, safety evaluations, or adverse event reports noting pregnancy loss linked to cavitation or acoustic exposures
	•	Interagency or contractor correspondence discussing energy-based reproductive control in the context of population management, humanitarian intervention, or operational settings
	•	Analyses of how such technologies would be perceived in relation to the history of forced sterilization and reproductive sabotage of communities of color in the United States and abroad

Keywords: ultrasound abortion, cavitation pregnancy termination, non-surgical abortion, HIFU reproductive disruption, acoustic pregnancy control, non-pharmaceutical abortion method, DARPA reproductive research, NICHD population control, reproductive sabotage, minority sterilization

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, contracts, grants, internal memoranda, interagency communications, or regulatory submissions from January 1, 1970 to present concerning embryo or zygote substitution, covert embryo transfer, or pregnancy manipulation resulting in non-paternity events (NPEs) in human or animal models.

This includes:
	•	Studies or operational testing of embryo or zygote removal and replacement in utero without maternal knowledge or consent
	•	Research on gamete mixing, donor substitution, or genetic masking designed to obscure biological parentage
	•	Communications regarding the behavioral, social, or genealogical impacts of non-paternity events arising from covert reproductive interventions
	•	Analyses of identity destabilization or population management through covert manipulation of paternity or maternity
	•	IRB/ethics reviews, contractor reports, or interagency discussions on the plausibility of embryo substitution as a covert control mechanism
	•	Records discussing genetic ancestry testing, NPE discovery, and its psychological/behavioral implications in relation to intelligence or defense programs

Keywords: non-paternity event, NPE, covert embryo transfer, embryo substitution, zygote replacement, gamete substitution, reproductive control, pregnancy manipulation, genetic masking, parentage anomaly, genealogical destabilization
