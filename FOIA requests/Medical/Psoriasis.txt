Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, internal communications, or contracts referencing the intersection of psoriasis and neurological technologies from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Studies examining neurological factors in the onset, progression, or remission of psoriasis
	•	Research into neuromodulation or brain–skin axis pathways related to psoriasis
	•	Communications or contracts involving the use of devices, implants, or external neurotechnologies in psoriasis treatment trials
	•	Reports or white papers on the role of stress, cognitive modulation, or central nervous system activity in psoriatic conditions
	•	Vendor partnerships or subcontractor agreements for technological interventions in psoriasis care

Keywords: psoriasis, brain–skin axis, neuromodulation, neuroimmune interface, psychodermatology, neurotechnology, inflammatory signaling, stress response, HPA axis, cognitive modulation

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, internal communications, vendor contracts, or subcontractor agreements relating to the use of psoriasis as a variable in neurological or behavioral modeling systems from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Studies or pilot programs exploring psoriasis flare activity as a marker of stress, compliance, or resistance in populations
	•	Research into the brain–skin axis as a pathway for behavioral entrainment or mood regulation
	•	Contracts with private vendors or defense contractors leveraging neurotech interventions (e.g., implants, wearables, signal modulation) for the purpose of monitoring or influencing psoriatic conditions
	•	Internal communications on psoriasis as a potential “visible signal” of underlying neurological or immunological stress states, useful for predictive analytics or behavioral futures markets
	•	Reports addressing the volatility of psoriasis expression in relation to environmental stressors, public health emergencies, or economic shocks

Keywords: psoriasis, behavioral futures, neurotech, brain–skin axis, psychodermatology, immune surveillance, predictive analytics, entrainment, signal volatility, stress modeling, compliance biomarker
