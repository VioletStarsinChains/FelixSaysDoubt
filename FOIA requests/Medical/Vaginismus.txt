To Department of Defense (DoD) / Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) / Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) / Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) / National Institutes of Health (NIH) / National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, communications, or research reports from January 1, 1980 to present concerning the induction, modulation, or study of vaginismus as a neurophysiological or behavioral compliance mechanism, particularly in relation to neurotechnology or neuromodulation.

This includes:
	•	Research or contracts involving neurotech-based induction of pelvic floor dysfunctions, including vaginismus, for the purpose of studying compliance under painful conditions
	•	Communications on the use of vaginismus as a behavioral model for tolerance of discomfort, risk, or pain in sexual or interpersonal contexts
	•	NIH- or NINDS-funded grants examining neurophysiological correlates of vaginismus in relation to neuromodulation or brain-computer interface studies
	•	Reports or interagency discussions connecting vaginismus to predictive modeling of compliance, sexual behavior, or reproductive outcomes
	•	Risk assessments or ethics reviews addressing intentional induction of vaginismus for research, field trials, or predictive analytics
	•	Contracts or collaborations with medical device manufacturers, NGOs, or universities exploring vaginismus in relation to neurotech or behavioral modeling research

Keywords: vaginismus, neurotechnology, DARPA compliance testing, pelvic floor dysfunction, pain entrainment, behavioral modeling, NINDS grants, neuromodulation, sexual compliance, predictive analytics

To Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) / Food and Drug Administration (FDA) / National Institutes of Health (NIH) / National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, communications, contracts, regulatory filings, or grant proposals from January 1, 1980 to present concerning private-sector development, testing, or regulation of neurotechnology or medical devices related to vaginismus, pelvic floor dysfunction, or sexual pain disorders, particularly in the context of compliance or behavioral modeling.

This includes:
	•	FDA submissions, safety reviews, or adverse event reports for neurostimulation or neuromodulation devices marketed for pelvic floor dysfunction or vaginismus treatment
	•	NIH- or NINDS-funded grants or contracts awarded to private companies (e.g., Medtronic, Boston Scientific, Abbott, Axonics, or other neurotech/device manufacturers) to study pelvic floor neuromodulation and its effects on sexual pain or compliance
	•	Communications between HHS, FDA, or NIH and pharmaceutical/device manufacturers regarding research into induced or treated vaginismus as a behavioral or compliance test
	•	Contracts or collaborative projects involving universities, NGOs, or device firms exploring the relationship between pelvic floor dysfunction and behavioral compliance models
	•	Reports or evaluations on the use of pelvic floor–focused neurotech for predictive modeling of risk tolerance, sexual behavior, or adherence to treatment
	•	Ethics reviews or internal discussions about the intentional induction, amplification, or manipulation of vaginismus in clinical or research contexts

Keywords: vaginismus, pelvic floor dysfunction, neuromodulation, neurostimulation device, FDA filings, Medtronic, Boston Scientific, Abbott, Axonics, behavioral compliance, predictive modeling
