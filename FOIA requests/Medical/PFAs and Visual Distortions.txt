Request:

Requesting any and all records, research studies, adverse event reports, contractor analyses, or interagency communications concerning neuropsychiatric, cognitive, or perceptual effects of PFAS exposure, with particular attention to visual distortions, hallucinations, or prosopometamorphopsia (face perception distortions), from January 1, 1995 to present.

This includes:
	•	Laboratory and epidemiological studies investigating PFAS neurotoxicity and its effects on visual association cortex, fusiform gyrus, and face recognition pathways
	•	Records describing or correlating PFAS exposure with hallucinatory experiences, migraine aura phenomena, seizures, or perceptual distortions
	•	Internal reports, risk assessments, or contractor analyses (including Palantir Technologies, Accenture Federal Services, Deloitte, Booz Allen Hamilton) modeling neuropsychiatric outcomes of PFAS exposure in vulnerable populations (children, neurodivergent individuals, migraineurs, seizure-prone individuals)
	•	Communications or case reports documenting PFAS-linked prosopometamorphopsia, facial distortions, or visual hallucinations in human subjects or animal models
	•	Records on PFAS interaction with calcium signaling, neurotransmitter systems, or blood–brain barrier penetration, as relevant to perceptual dysfunction
	•	Neuroimaging studies (fMRI, PET, EEG, MEG) conducted on PFAS-exposed populations or animals, especially if involving face recognition tasks
	•	Guidance documents, training materials, or briefing notes for federal staff addressing mental health or perceptual symptoms of PFAS exposure
	•	Any memoranda or data-sharing agreements with defense agencies regarding PFAS neurobehavioral effects and perceptual modulation research
