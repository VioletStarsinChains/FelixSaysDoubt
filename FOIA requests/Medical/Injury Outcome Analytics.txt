Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, contracts, interagency communications, or oversight reports from 1990 to present concerning the deliberate replication, simulation, or accelerated onset of traumatic brain injury (TBI) conditions in professional or elite athletes for the purposes of neurological or behavioral study.

This includes:
	•	Studies involving induced concussion or head impact protocols in athlete populations
	•	Correspondence with professional sports leagues, athletic commissions, or training facilities regarding experimental head injury exposure
	•	Behavioral outcome analyses linked to athlete TBI datasets, especially where results are segmented by demographic characteristics
	•	Proposals or communications on public messaging strategies for linking TBI symptoms to patterns of aggression or conduct
	•	Reviews of predictive modeling projects using athlete brain injury data for behavioral risk assessment

Keywords: athlete concussion protocol, induced head trauma, demographic behavioral analysis, neurological injury research, sports injury modeling, concussion outcome segmentation, predictive aggression modeling, professional sports health oversight

To: Department of Defense / DARPA / Department of Health and Human Services / National Institutes of Health / Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, internal communications, contracts, or interagency agreements from 1990 to present regarding the intentional induction, simulation, or controlled replication of traumatic brain injury (TBI) conditions in athletic populations, particularly those involving public figures or professional sports.

This includes:
	•	Studies or pilot programs involving TBI symptom induction for behavioral or neurological research
	•	Communications between federal agencies and private sports organizations regarding athlete brain injury protocols or experimental exposure
	•	Analysis or datasets correlating head injury incidence with behavioral outcomes in specific demographic cohorts
	•	Proposals for media or public communication strategies related to athlete TBI and behavioral risk perception
	•	Research exploring the use of neurological injury data to inform predictive modeling of aggression or criminality

Keywords: controlled concussion, neurological injury modeling, demographic risk profiling, athlete neurobehavioral study, behavioral aggression correlation, TBI induction protocol, public perception management, injury outcome analytics
