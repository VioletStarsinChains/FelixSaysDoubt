Request:

Requesting any and all reports, toxicological assessments, epidemiological studies, meeting minutes, internal communications, and contractor deliverables from 1990 to present regarding human health impacts of atrazine exposure, including but not limited to:
	•	Endocrine disruption and hormonal imbalance in adults or children
	•	Reproductive and developmental effects (fertility, pregnancy outcomes, birth defects)
	•	Neurological and neurobehavioral outcomes associated with atrazine exposure
	•	Immunological effects or increased susceptibility to disease
	•	Carcinogenic potential in relation to chronic or acute exposure
	•	Presence and persistence of atrazine in drinking water and associated health risk assessments
	•	Synergistic or combined effects of atrazine with other agricultural chemicals

Keywords: atrazine, endocrine disruption, reproductive toxicity, developmental toxicity, neurobehavioral effects, immune suppression, carcinogenicity, drinking water contamination, pesticide exposure, hormonal imbalance, aromatase activation, combined pesticide exposure

Request:

Requesting any and all reports, toxicological assessments, epidemiological studies, meeting minutes, internal communications, and contractor deliverables from 1990 to present regarding human health impacts of atrazine exposure, with particular attention to:
	•	Endocrine disruption and hormonal imbalance in adults or children, including low-dose and chronic exposure effects
	•	Reproductive and developmental impacts, such as changes in fertility, pregnancy outcomes, and congenital abnormalities
	•	Neurological and neurobehavioral outcomes, including mood regulation, attention, and cognitive function
	•	Immunological effects, including altered immune response and increased susceptibility to infectious or autoimmune disease
	•	Carcinogenic potential associated with both acute and cumulative exposure levels
	•	Presence and persistence of atrazine in public and private drinking water systems, including regional and seasonal variation in concentrations
	•	Synergistic or combined effects of atrazine with other agricultural chemicals, fertilizers, or industrial contaminants
	•	Population-specific vulnerability, including disproportionate exposure or health effects in rural agricultural communities, economically disadvantaged populations, and historically marginalized groups
	•	Intergenerational effects from prenatal or early-life exposure, including epigenetic changes and developmental programming outcomes

Keywords: atrazine, endocrine disruption, reproductive toxicity, developmental toxicity, neurobehavioral effects, immune suppression, carcinogenicity, drinking water contamination, pesticide exposure, hormonal imbalance, aromatase activation, low-dose effects, cumulative exposure, environmental justice, health disparities, combined pesticide exposure, epigenetic effects
