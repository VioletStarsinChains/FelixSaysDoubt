Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, communications, or research reports from January 1, 1980 to present concerning erectile dysfunction (ED) as a neurophysiological, pharmacological, or behavioral compliance variable in U.S. government or contractor research.

This includes:
	•	Research into the induction or modulation of erectile dysfunction via neurotechnology, neuromodulation, or pharmacological means for behavioral modeling purposes
	•	Reports or communications on ED as a compliance test (i.e., persistence or withdrawal from sexual activity under conditions of dysfunction or humiliation)
	•	NIH/NINDS grants examining neurophysiological correlates of erectile dysfunction in relation to pain, reward, or compliance frameworks
	•	Interagency communications between DoD, DARPA, CIA, and HHS regarding ED as a behavioral variable in predictive modeling of relationship dynamics, risk-taking, or adherence
	•	FDA submissions, reviews, or adverse event reports for devices or pharmaceuticals where erectile dysfunction induction/resolution was monitored as a behavioral outcome
	•	Contracts or collaborative research with pharmaceutical/device firms (e.g., Pfizer, Eli Lilly, Boston Scientific, Medtronic, etc.) linking ED data to compliance, behavioral futures modeling, or sexual performance metrics

Keywords: erectile dysfunction, ED induction, neurotechnology, DARPA behavioral modeling, neuromodulation, compliance testing, NINDS grants, Pfizer, sildenafil, predictive analytics, sexual compliance

To Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) / Food and Drug Administration (FDA) / National Institutes of Health (NIH) / National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, communications, contracts, regulatory filings, grant materials, post‑marketing studies, or research reports from January 1, 1980 to present concerning the use of erectile dysfunction (ED) data by pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers for behavioral modeling, compliance analysis, or predictive analytics beyond clinical efficacy and safety.

This includes:
	•	FDA submissions, briefing documents, meeting minutes, and review memos referencing behavioral, psychosocial, or compliance endpoints in ED drug/device applications (e.g., PDE5 inhibitors, neuromodulation, vacuum devices, implants)
	•	Post‑marketing (Phase IV), pharmacovigilance, or real‑world evidence studies where ED outcomes were analyzed alongside adherence, treatment persistence, partner dynamics, or risk‑compensation behaviors
	•	NIH/NINDS grants or cooperative agreements with private companies (e.g., Pfizer, Eli Lilly, Bayer, Boston Scientific, Medtronic, Coloplast, AMS/Endo) involving ED measures as predictors of behavior, compliance, or quality‑of‑life decision‑making
	•	Correspondence with manufacturers, CROs, or academic partners regarding the use of ED trial data to build predictive models of sexual behavior, relationship stability, or health‑seeking/commercial behaviors
	•	Contracts or data‑use agreements enabling linkage of ED clinical or registry data with claims, EHR, wearable/app telemetry, or marketing datasets for behavioral analytics
	•	Internal analyses, policy memos, or ethics reviews discussing ED as a behavioral variable or “compliance lever” in industry‑sponsored studies, registries, or market research

Keywords: erectile dysfunction, PDE5 inhibitors, sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, post‑marketing surveillance, behavioral analytics, compliance modeling, neuromodulation device, vacuum erection device, NINDS grants, FDA submissions
