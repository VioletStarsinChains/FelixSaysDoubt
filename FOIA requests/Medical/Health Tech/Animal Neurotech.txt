FOIA Request: Neurotechnology Experiments on Animal Communication

To: National Institutes of Health (NIH – National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA – Biological Technologies Office), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA – Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service), and National Science Foundation (NSF – Division of Integrative Organismal Systems)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, contracts, grant proposals, research reports, or internal communications from 2000 to present concerning neurotechnology, neural interface, or experimental communication systems used with non-human animals, particularly parrots, dogs, and cats.

This includes:
	•	Research projects involving avian subjects such as parrots, including but not limited to “Apollo the Parrot” and similar cases where vocalization or communication is enhanced through experimental methods
	•	Studies of canine and feline communication using augmentative devices such as soundboard buttons, integrated sensors, or neurotechnological feedback systems
	•	Contracts or collaborations with universities, private labs, or technology companies to explore animal–machine communication interfaces
	•	Ethical reviews, grant justifications, or risk assessments related to neural entrainment or communication augmentation in animals
	•	Internal communications referencing YouTube-documented or publicly visible cases of animals “speaking” with augmentative devices, and whether these were observed, supported, or replicated by federal programs

Keywords: animal neurotech, animal communication, neural interface, Apollo the Parrot, canine soundboard, feline communication device, DARPA BTO, augmentative communication, entrainment research
