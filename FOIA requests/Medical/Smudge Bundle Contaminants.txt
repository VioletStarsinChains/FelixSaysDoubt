Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, research proposals, interagency communications, vendor agreements, or testing results from 2000 to present concerning the presence of pesticide residues — including atrazine — in consumer smudge bundles (sage, mugwort, cedar), ritual woods (e.g., palo santo), or incense products marketed in the United States.

This includes:
	•	Laboratory analyses or toxicological studies on pesticide residues (e.g., atrazine, glyphosate, organophosphates) in ritual smoke products
	•	Import/export monitoring records or customs testing of ritual herbs and woods for pesticide contamination
	•	Contracts or cooperative agreements with vendors or distributors for product testing and chemical certification
	•	Interagency communications regarding the risk of pesticide-contaminated smudge or incense products for consumers, particularly children and immunocompromised individuals
	•	Public advisories, safety guidance, or regulatory memos concerning pesticide residues in ritual smoke products

Keywords: atrazine, pesticide residues, smudge bundle, sage, mugwort, palo santo, incense, consumer product safety, combustion exposure, EPA, FDA, CPSC, NIST

Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, research proposals, interagency communications, vendor agreements, or policy assessments from 2000 to present concerning the use of pesticide-contaminated ritual smoke products (including smudge bundles of sage, mugwort, cedar; ritual woods such as palo santo; or incense) as entrainment tools in the context of behavioral modeling, predictive analytics, or behavioral futures markets.

This includes:
	•	Research or pilot programs evaluating the behavioral and physiological impacts of atrazine and other pesticide residues delivered through ritual smoke exposure
	•	Studies testing ritualized smoke ceremonies as compliance anchors for group synchronization or student population management, particularly when pesticide residues are present
	•	Interagency communications on combining ritual entrainment with covert chemical exposures to profile compliance, arousal, or volatility
	•	Contracts or cooperative agreements with vendors, importers, or distributors to seed pesticide-contaminated ritual products into retail or institutional environments (schools, wellness programs, cultural events)
	•	Ethical reviews, risk assessments, or policy discussions concerning covert use of contaminated ritual products for predictive modeling purposes
	•	Analyses correlating pesticide exposure via ritual smoke with behavioral telemetry datasets (student performance, group cohesion, consumer loyalty, volatility profiles)
