Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, contracts, internal communications, memoranda, or reports from 1990 to present referencing breast cancer in connection with environmental contaminants, including but not limited to:
	•	Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (e.g., BPA, phthalates, parabens, alkylphenols, atrazine)
	•	Persistent organic pollutants (e.g., PCBs, dioxins, organochlorine pesticides)
	•	Heavy metals and metalloids (e.g., cadmium, arsenic, nickel, chromium compounds)
	•	Industrial or household chemical exposures (e.g., PAHs, PFAS, VOCs, benzene, styrene)
	•	Environmental radiation sources (ionizing and non-ionizing)
	•	Cross-analysis of environmental exposures with breast cancer incidence, severity, or treatment outcomes
	•	Predictive modeling, surveillance, or risk stratification efforts linking environmental contaminants to breast cancer clusters or population trends

Keywords: breast cancer, endocrine disruptor, BPA, phthalates, parabens, PFAS, PCBs, dioxins, organochlorine pesticide, cadmium, arsenic, nickel, chromium, benzene, PAH, atrazine, environmental exposure, cancer cluster, predictive modeling

To: Department of Defense (DoD) / Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) / Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) / National Institutes of Health (NIH) / Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)

Request:

Requesting any and all contracts, research proposals, internal communications, memoranda, or reports from 2000 to present referencing breast cancer or related environmental exposure syndromes in the context of behavioral futures markets. This includes but is not limited to:
	•	Use of environmental contaminants (e.g., endocrine disruptors, persistent organic pollutants, heavy metals, radiation sources) in predictive modeling of population health outcomes
	•	Exploitation of breast cancer risk or incidence as a volatility driver for health-related prediction markets
	•	Interagency or contractor communications regarding the use of cancer diagnoses or survivorship trajectories as predictive inputs for behavioral markets
	•	Deliberate or incidental engineering of environmental conditions (air, water, food chain contamination) for the purpose of creating forecastable volatility in breast cancer rates
	•	Cross-analysis of breast cancer clusters with financial or behavioral data sets to assess predictive accuracy or commercial application in futures markets

Keywords: breast cancer, behavioral futures markets, predictive modeling, volatility, population health forecasting, endocrine disruptor, PFAS, PCBs, dioxins, cadmium, cancer clusters, DARPA, DoD, synthetic exposure, environmental engineering

To: Department of Defense (DoD) / Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) / Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) / National Institutes of Health (NIH) / Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)

Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, contracts, internal communications, memoranda, or reports from 2000 to present referencing breast cancer or related environmental exposure syndromes in connection with behavioral futures markets and profit-making opportunities derived from population suffering. Specifically seeking documents that address:
	•	Deliberate or tolerated environmental contamination (endocrine disruptors, persistent organic pollutants, heavy metals, radiation) where increased breast cancer incidence created forecastable volatility in behavioral or financial markets
	•	Interagency or contractor communications on the exploitation of breast cancer as a driver of market speculation, including predictive accuracy benchmarks tied to morbidity and mortality
	•	Cross-analysis of breast cancer incidence, treatment uptake, and survivorship with consumer behavior, workforce participation, or political behavior for commercial or surveillance purposes
	•	Development of algorithms or models that explicitly monetize disease progression, recurrence, or survivorship as forecastable events
	•	Any mention of the ethical considerations, or lack thereof, in treating cancer diagnoses not as tragedies but as financial instruments in prediction markets

Keywords: breast cancer, behavioral futures markets, prediction markets, volatility, profiteering, population suffering, endocrine disruptor, PFAS, PCBs, dioxins, cadmium, cancer clusters, DARPA, DoD, market speculation, disease commodification
