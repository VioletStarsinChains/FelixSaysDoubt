Request:

Requesting any and all documents, trial protocols, internal communications, contractor agreements, or outcome reports from 2019 to present related to comparative research on U.S.-approved COVID-19 vaccine platforms, including mRNA (Pfizer, Moderna), protein subunit (Novavax), and viral vector (Johnson & Johnson) vaccines.

This includes:
	•	Comparative studies examining differences in immune response durability, inflammatory profiles, or neurological outcomes across vaccine types
	•	Behavioral or psychiatric correlates tracked alongside immunological data in trial participants
	•	Head-to-head trials evaluating platform-specific effects in subpopulations (e.g., autoimmune, neurodivergent, immunocompromised)
	•	Post-market surveillance comparing long-term physiological or behavioral impacts of each vaccine category
	•	Internal analyses or third-party audits assessing adverse event patterns by vaccine platform
	•	Communications regarding data sharing agreements between vaccine manufacturers, HHS, and AI modeling platforms
	•	Any stratification protocols or behavioral segmentation methodologies used in platform comparisons
