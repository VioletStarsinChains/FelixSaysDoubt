Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, grant files, protocols, IND/IDE submissions, adverse event reports, internal communications, or oversight reviews related to mitochondrial transfer/“three-parent” embryo techniques in the United States, from 1980 to 2005. This includes (but is not limited to) ooplasmic (cytoplasmic) transfer, mitochondrial donation/replacement therapy (MRT), spindle transfer, and pronuclear transfer, particularly in advanced maternal age or “high-risk” pregnancies and any work conducted in or affiliated with San Antonio, Texas (e.g., Brooke Army Medical Center, Fort Sam Houston, UTHSCSA) or with military medical partners.

This includes:
	•	Research proposals, funded grants, contracts, protocol amendments, IRB approvals, and OHRP correspondence for ooplasmic/cytoplasmic transfer, MRT, spindle or pronuclear transfer.
	•	IND/IDE filings, FDA review memoranda, ethics opinions, and risk assessments regarding embryo manipulation involving donor cytoplasm/mitochondria.
	•	Monitoring plans and reports on heteroplasmy, genetic parentage tracking (nuclear DNA vs. mtDNA), maternal age stratification, and outcomes follow-up (pregnancy, neonatal, developmental).
	•	Adverse event reports, safety audits, data safety monitoring board minutes, and communications about procedure halts, suspensions, or policy changes.
	•	Interagency and contractor communications with military medical centers and civilian IVF/fertility clinics regarding these techniques, including site selection in Texas and San Antonio.
	•	Guidance, policy memos, and legal analyses concerning consent/authorization, disclosure to subjects, and interstate or interagency collaboration.

Keywords: mitochondrial transfer, ooplasmic transfer, cytoplasmic donation, spindle transfer, pronuclear transfer, mitochondrial replacement therapy, heteroplasmy, three-parent embryo, advanced maternal age, IND/IDE, IVF, San Antonio

Request:

Requesting any and all records, research proposals, grant applications, clinical trial data, interagency communications, or contractor reports from 1975 to present concerning the use of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) to achieve live births in cases involving sex chromosome anomalies, particularly X–Y translocations.

This includes:
	•	Records of federally funded or university-based studies on cytoplasmic transfer, nuclear transfer, or three-parent embryo techniques applied to individuals or families with sex chromosome abnormalities (e.g., X–Y translocations, derivative chromosomes, mosaicism).
	•	Clinical trial protocols, internal reports, or case studies documenting live births from experimental ART methods used to overcome infertility caused by chromosomal rearrangements.
	•	Oversight reviews, ethical board minutes, or correspondence discussing the potential for offspring with derivative chromosomes (e.g., 47,XX,+t(X;Y)) as a result of ART interventions.
	•	Interagency communications (NIH, NICHD, NHGRI, DoD, UT Health San Antonio, and related centers) regarding experimental embryo manipulation techniques in the late 1970s through 1990s, especially involving sex chromosome–related infertility.
	•	Funding records or contractor deliverables referencing “three-parent embryo,” “nuclear transfer,” “cytoplasmic rescue,” or “embryo repair” in the context of sex chromosome anomalies.
	•	Reports on health outcomes, long-term follow-up, or immune/metabolic anomalies in children conceived via these methods.

Request:

Requesting any and all records, grant applications, research proposals, contractor reports, or interagency communications from 1990 to present concerning the use of cervical or endometrial cells (including cells collected during Pap smears, cervical biopsies, or related gynecological procedures) for the purpose of:
	•	Generating induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) or other pluripotent cell lines.
	•	Differentiating such cells into oocyte-like cells or other gamete precursors in vitro.
	•	Evaluating the feasibility of using Pap smear–derived cells as a source of reproductive material for research, therapeutic, or assisted reproduction applications.
	•	Oversight reviews or ethical assessments regarding the use of cervical or Pap smear–derived cells in reproductive or stem cell studies.
	•	Reports or correspondence involving NIH, NICHD, FDA, or affiliated contractors/universities that mention “non-ovarian sources of oocytes,” “somatic-to-gamete differentiation,” or “Pap smear–derived stem cells.”
	•	Documentation of long-term follow-up studies assessing the safety, efficacy, or public health implications of using cervical/endometrial cells for reproductive or regenerative medicine.

Request:

Requesting any and all records, grant applications, internal reports, contractor deliverables, oversight reviews, or interagency communications from 1980 to present concerning three-parent embryo research (mitochondrial replacement therapy, cytoplasmic transfer, nuclear transfer, or other multi-parent embryo construction techniques) with emphasis on non-therapeutic or non-disease-prevention applications.

This includes:
	•	Records of federally funded studies or clinical trials exploring three-parent embryos for purposes beyond mitochondrial disease prevention, such as fertility enhancement, embryo viability, or genetic/epigenetic resilience testing.
	•	Oversight reviews, bioethics board minutes, or correspondence discussing the potential dual-use applications of three-parent embryos, including demographic control, lineage manipulation, or experimental stress-testing.
	•	Interagency communications between NIH, FDA, DoD, and academic contractors regarding the strategic or security implications of three-parent embryo technologies.
	•	Documentation of contractor or university deliverables analyzing long-term health, behavioral, or metabolic outcomes in offspring conceived through three-parent or cytoplasmic transfer methods.
	•	Reports or correspondence concerning alternative rationales for three-parent embryo work (e.g., enhancing reproductive supply chains, creating test cohorts, or expanding acceptable precedent for engineered embryos).
	•	Ethical assessments or advisory memos that differentiate between therapeutic mitochondrial replacement applications and non-therapeutic embryo engineering programs.
