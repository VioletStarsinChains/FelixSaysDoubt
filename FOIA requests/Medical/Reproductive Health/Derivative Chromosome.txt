Request:

Requesting any and all records, grant applications, research proposals, contractor reports, or interagency communications from 1980 to present concerning the creation, study, or implantation of human artificial chromosomes (HACs), marker chromosomes, or derivative sex chromosomes that contain nonhuman or synthetic DNA sequences.

This includes:
	•	Records of research into the use of engineered chromosomes as carriers of viral, bacterial, synthetic, or animal DNA for the purposes of fertility interventions, embryo viability testing, or reproductive health studies.
	•	Reports on clinical trials or experimental programs where embryos were constructed with or screened for marker chromosomes containing nonhuman or synthetic material.
	•	Oversight reviews, ethics board minutes, or correspondence regarding the use of HACs or engineered derivative chromosomes in human fertility or developmental research.
	•	Interagency communications between NIH, NHGRI, NICHD, and DoD regarding the dual-use implications of implanting embryos with engineered or hybrid chromosomes.
	•	Documentation of population follow-up or health surveillance studies on individuals identified as carrying marker chromosomes or derivative X–Y chromosomes with nonhuman inserts.
	•	Funding records, grant deliverables, or contractor white papers that reference foreign DNA, chimeric chromosomes, synthetic control sequences, or hybrid reproductive systems in the context of embryo research.
