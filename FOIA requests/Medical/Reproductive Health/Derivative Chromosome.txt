Request:

Requesting any and all records, grant applications, research proposals, contractor reports, or interagency communications from 1980 to present concerning the creation, study, or implantation of human artificial chromosomes (HACs), marker chromosomes, or derivative sex chromosomes that contain nonhuman or synthetic DNA sequences.

This includes:
	•	Records of research into the use of engineered chromosomes as carriers of viral, bacterial, synthetic, or animal DNA for the purposes of fertility interventions, embryo viability testing, or reproductive health studies.
	•	Reports on clinical trials or experimental programs where embryos were constructed with or screened for marker chromosomes containing nonhuman or synthetic material.
	•	Oversight reviews, ethics board minutes, or correspondence regarding the use of HACs or engineered derivative chromosomes in human fertility or developmental research.
	•	Interagency communications between NIH, NHGRI, NICHD, and DoD regarding the dual-use implications of implanting embryos with engineered or hybrid chromosomes.
	•	Documentation of population follow-up or health surveillance studies on individuals identified as carrying marker chromosomes or derivative X–Y chromosomes with nonhuman inserts.
	•	Funding records, grant deliverables, or contractor white papers that reference foreign DNA, chimeric chromosomes, synthetic control sequences, or hybrid reproductive systems in the context of embryo research.

To Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) / Food and Drug Administration (FDA)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, surveillance reports, adverse event data, contractor deliverables, or interagency communications from 1980 to present concerning health outcomes in individuals carrying human artificial chromosomes (HACs), marker chromosomes, or derivative sex chromosomes that include nonhuman or synthetic DNA sequences.

This includes:
	•	Surveillance data, registries, or follow-up studies tracking developmental, immune, metabolic, or reproductive health outcomes in individuals identified with engineered or hybrid chromosomes.
	•	Records of adverse event reporting or unusual clinical presentations (e.g., atypical antibody production, immune dysregulation, nonstandard reproductive anatomy) linked to marker chromosomes or derivative X–Y chromosomes with foreign inserts.
	•	Oversight reviews or ethics board documents concerning the monitoring of individuals conceived through experimental ART involving engineered chromosomes.
	•	Interagency communications between CDC, FDA, and NIH/NHGRI/NICHD regarding the public health or safety implications of implanting embryos with HACs or chromosomes containing synthetic/nonhuman sequences.
	•	Documentation of long-term cohort studies or contractor analyses evaluating lifespan health effects, cancer risk, or immune/metabolic differences in such individuals.
	•	Reports of screening programs (clinical, public health, or research-based) that flagged chromosomal material inconsistent with standard human karyotypes.
