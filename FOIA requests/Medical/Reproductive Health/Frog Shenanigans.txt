To NIH / NICHD / NHGRI / FDA / Department of Defense (DoD)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, research proposals, grant applications, contractor reports, internal communications, oversight reviews, or clinical/animal study documentation from 1970 to present concerning the use of amphibian (e.g., Xenopus) DNA, RNA, proteins, or cytoplasmic extracts in human reproductive or developmental contexts, including embryo/ gamete manipulation, nuclear/cytoplasmic transfer, or insertion of amphibian genetic elements into mammalian (including human) cells or embryos.

This includes:
	•	Studies on nuclear transfer or cytoplasmic reprogramming using Xenopus oocytes/egg extracts applied to human or mammalian cells/embryos.
	•	Records of vectorized insertion (viral, transposon, artificial chromosome) of amphibian gene sequences (e.g., thyroid hormone–responsive elements, developmental enhancers, opsins/photopigments, antimicrobial peptides such as magainins) into mammalian or human systems.
	•	Documentation of safety, immune, endocrine, fertility, or oncogenicity assessments related to amphibian-derived inserts or factors in human-adjacent research.
	•	Interagency communications (NIH, NICHD, NHGRI, FDA, DoD) and correspondence with universities/CROs regarding dual-use implications of amphibian materials in human developmental or assisted reproduction research.
	•	Any pilot programs, clinical protocols, or long-term follow-ups involving human subjects or germline-adjacent tissues where amphibian factors or sequences were used.
	•	Ethics board minutes, regulatory reviews, or guidance distinguishing basic research (e.g., frog oocyte expression assays) from translational or reproductive applications in humans.
