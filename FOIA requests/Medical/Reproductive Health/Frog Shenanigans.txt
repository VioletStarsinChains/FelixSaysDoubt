To NIH / NICHD / NHGRI / FDA / Department of Defense (DoD)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, research proposals, grant applications, contractor reports, internal communications, oversight reviews, or clinical/animal study documentation from 1970 to present concerning the use of amphibian (e.g., Xenopus) DNA, RNA, proteins, or cytoplasmic extracts in human reproductive or developmental contexts, including embryo/ gamete manipulation, nuclear/cytoplasmic transfer, or insertion of amphibian genetic elements into mammalian (including human) cells or embryos.

This includes:
	•	Studies on nuclear transfer or cytoplasmic reprogramming using Xenopus oocytes/egg extracts applied to human or mammalian cells/embryos.
	•	Records of vectorized insertion (viral, transposon, artificial chromosome) of amphibian gene sequences (e.g., thyroid hormone–responsive elements, developmental enhancers, opsins/photopigments, antimicrobial peptides such as magainins) into mammalian or human systems.
	•	Documentation of safety, immune, endocrine, fertility, or oncogenicity assessments related to amphibian-derived inserts or factors in human-adjacent research.
	•	Interagency communications (NIH, NICHD, NHGRI, FDA, DoD) and correspondence with universities/CROs regarding dual-use implications of amphibian materials in human developmental or assisted reproduction research.
	•	Any pilot programs, clinical protocols, or long-term follow-ups involving human subjects or germline-adjacent tissues where amphibian factors or sequences were used.
	•	Ethics board minutes, regulatory reviews, or guidance distinguishing basic research (e.g., frog oocyte expression assays) from translational or reproductive applications in humans.

Keywords: Xenopus, frog oocyte, egg extract, nuclear transfer, cytoplasmic transfer, thyroid hormone response element, magainin, amphibian enhancer, artificial chromosome, transposon vector, germline manipulation, dual-use

To Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) / National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, surveillance data, research reports, registries, contractor deliverables, or interagency communications from 1970 to present concerning health outcomes in children conceived through assisted reproductive technologies (ART) or experimental protocols that involved amphibian-derived material (e.g., Xenopus DNA, RNA, proteins, or egg cytoplasmic extracts).

This includes:
	•	Surveillance registries or cohort studies tracking developmental, endocrine, immune, or metabolic outcomes in children conceived following use of amphibian egg cytoplasm, nuclear transfer techniques, or embryo manipulation with amphibian factors.
	•	Documentation of adverse event reports or unusual clinical presentations (e.g., thyroid-axis anomalies, fertility disorders, atypical developmental trajectories) in offspring linked to such protocols.
	•	Long-term follow-up studies funded or overseen by CDC/NCHS assessing outcomes of ART or germline research where frog or amphibian-derived sequences were inserted or used in human or mammalian embryos.
	•	Correspondence between CDC, NIH, FDA, DoD, and academic institutions regarding dual-use or public health implications of integrating amphibian DNA/proteins into reproductive research.
	•	Reports or contractor analyses of fertility, cancer incidence, or immune function in populations exposed to experimental ART involving amphibian material.
	•	Ethics board minutes or advisory memos distinguishing between basic amphibian developmental biology and translation of those techniques into human reproductive contexts.
