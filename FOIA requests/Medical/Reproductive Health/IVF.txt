To NIH / National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) / Food and Drug Administration (FDA)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, grant applications, research proposals, contractor reports, or interagency communications from 1990 to present concerning the development and regulation of novel sources of oocytes for use in assisted reproductive technologies (ART) and in vitro fertilization (IVF).

This includes:
	•	Research into the generation of oocytes from non-ovarian somatic cells, including but not limited to cervical, endometrial, or other reproductive tract cells.
	•	Records of federally funded studies evaluating the feasibility of using somatic or Pap smear–derived cells for differentiation into oocyte-like cells or gamete precursors.
	•	Oversight documents or ethical reviews regarding the collection of reproductive tract cells during routine gynecological care (e.g., Pap smears, biopsies) for potential downstream use in reproductive research.
	•	Correspondence between NIH, NICHD, FDA, and affiliated universities or contractors regarding the translation of stem cell–derived oocytes into IVF settings.
	•	Documentation of clinical trial proposals or pilot programs that sought to integrate nontraditional oocyte sources into reproductive medicine.

To Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) / National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, surveillance data, research reports, contractor deliverables, or interagency communications from 1990 to present concerning the long-term health outcomes of children conceived through assisted reproductive technologies (ART) and in vitro fertilization (IVF) involving novel oocyte sources.

This includes:
	•	Records of CDC or NCHS monitoring programs that tracked developmental, metabolic, immune, or reproductive health outcomes in children born from IVF using non-ovarian oocytes or stem cell–derived gametes.
	•	Data collection, surveillance reports, or contractor analyses on pregnancies or births resulting from cytoplasmic transfer, nuclear transfer, or three-parent embryo techniques.
	•	Oversight reviews or ethics board minutes addressing the use of cervical/endometrial cells collected during routine gynecological care (e.g., Pap smears, biopsies) as a source of oocytes for ART.
	•	Interagency communications (CDC, NIH, FDA, NICHD) regarding registries or follow-up studies for children conceived via nontraditional gamete sources.
	•	Documentation of pilot studies, case series, or adverse event reports linking novel oocyte generation techniques to long-term health monitoring of offspring.
