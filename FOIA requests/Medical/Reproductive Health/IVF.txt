To NIH / National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) / Food and Drug Administration (FDA)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, grant applications, research proposals, contractor reports, or interagency communications from 1990 to present concerning the development and regulation of novel sources of oocytes for use in assisted reproductive technologies (ART) and in vitro fertilization (IVF).

This includes:
	•	Research into the generation of oocytes from non-ovarian somatic cells, including but not limited to cervical, endometrial, or other reproductive tract cells.
	•	Records of federally funded studies evaluating the feasibility of using somatic or Pap smear–derived cells for differentiation into oocyte-like cells or gamete precursors.
	•	Oversight documents or ethical reviews regarding the collection of reproductive tract cells during routine gynecological care (e.g., Pap smears, biopsies) for potential downstream use in reproductive research.
	•	Correspondence between NIH, NICHD, FDA, and affiliated universities or contractors regarding the translation of stem cell–derived oocytes into IVF settings.
	•	Documentation of clinical trial proposals or pilot programs that sought to integrate nontraditional oocyte sources into reproductive medicine.
