To Department of Education / NIH / DARPA / DHS

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, research proposals, or internal memoranda from 1985 to present concerning the use of child-rearing simulations in high school curricula (e.g., egg assignments, baby doll programs, or digital parenting simulators) as tools for behavioral modeling or compliance testing.

This includes:
	•	Records of federally funded studies on the psychological or behavioral effects of simulated parenting assignments in adolescent populations
	•	Research on how parenting simulations shape long-term attitudes toward family planning, compliance, or responsibility
	•	Internal communications regarding child-rearing simulations as mechanisms for measuring or influencing demographic, reproductive, or behavioral outcomes
	•	Contracts with educational vendors supplying “baby simulators” or similar programs for classroom use
	•	Reports on how simulation-based parenting assignments have been used as predictive modeling inputs in public health, demographic planning, or behavioral futures markets

Keywords: child-rearing simulation, baby simulator, egg assignment, digital parenting program, behavioral modeling, compliance testing, high school curriculum, family planning education, adolescent psychology, predictive modeling

To FDA / NIH / CDC

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, studies, contracts, or internal communications from 2000 to present concerning federally funded research on fertility drug outcomes and synthetic gestation technologies.

This includes:
	•	Records evaluating the effectiveness of GLP-1 receptor agonists and related drugs on fertility outcomes in clinical or population studies
	•	Research proposals or contracts relating to synthetic gestation, assisted reproductive technologies, or biomedical simulations of pregnancy
	•	Internal communications regarding how fertility drug narratives are used in conjunction with emerging reproductive technologies
	•	Reports assessing the potential public health impacts of combining pharmaceutical fertility interventions with novel pregnancy or gestational platforms
	•	Vendor or contractor agreements with fertility clinics, biotech firms, or academic researchers studying alternative pregnancy methods

Keywords: GLP-1 fertility, synthetic gestation, assisted reproductive technologies, pregnancy simulation, fertility outcomes, public health research, reproductive biotech, clinical trials, maternal health

To FDA / NIH / CDC / DHS / DARPA

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, contracts, or interagency correspondence from 2000 to present concerning synthetic pregnancy technologies and their relationship to fertility drug narratives.

This includes:
	•	Records on the use of GLP-1 receptor agonists and related drugs as public-facing fertility interventions or cover narratives for fertility outcomes
	•	Research into synthetic gestation, hormonal entrainment, or biomedical/neurotechnological simulations of pregnancy as responses to population-level infertility
	•	Internal communications on the strategic use of fertility drug marketing to obscure or mitigate awareness of widespread infertility trends
	•	Contracts or agreements with pharmaceutical companies, fertility clinics, or biotech firms relating to the integration of synthetic pregnancies into behavioral or demographic modeling
	•	Reports assessing the role of synthetic pregnancies in sustaining compliance anchors (maternal identity, family structure) in the context of declining natural fertility rates

Keywords: synthetic pregnancy, GLP-1 fertility, infertility cover narrative, gestation simulation, behavioral futures, reproductive compliance, population modeling, fertility drug marketing, neurotech gestation, synthetic offspring
