To Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) / Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) / Minnesota Department of Public Safety – State Fire Marshal Division / Minnesota Department of Labor & Industry – MNOSHA

Request:

Requesting any and all risk assessments, policy analyses, inspection/incident reports, datasets, and internal or interagency communications addressing ignition hazards associated with open-flame cannabis use (combustion of cannabis flower) in Minnesota, from 2000 to present, with specific consideration of co-located hazardous materials in residential, retail food-service, transportation-adjacent, and other public environments.

This includes:
• Fire modeling or hazard analyses evaluating methane, hydrogen sulfide, solvent vapors/VOCs, simple asphyxiants (CO₂, N₂), or oxidizers in spaces where smoking materials (lighters/matches) may be present
• Incident and near-miss reports involving smoking materials as ignition sources in facilities storing compressed gases, petroleum products (e.g., jet fuel, propane), de-icing chemicals, or oxidizers
• Guidance memos, white papers, or legislative briefings comparing risks of smoked cannabis products vs. non-combustion THC products (edibles, beverages, vapes) in mixed-hazard environments
• Building/fire code interpretations or enforcement policies relating to NFPA 704 placarding (including “SA”), ventilation/CO₂ beverage systems, and prohibitions on open flames in retail/food service sites
• Indoor air quality or environmental monitoring data documenting flammable or oxygen-displacing gases in restaurants, airports, and similar public settings, and any linkage to open-flame restrictions
• Communications with local governments regarding airport-adjacent neighborhoods, fuel storage/transport, and open-flame risk mitigation
