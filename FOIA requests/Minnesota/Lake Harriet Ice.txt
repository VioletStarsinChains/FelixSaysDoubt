Request:

Requesting any and all records, datasets, internal analyses, and communications regarding Lake Harriet (Minneapolis, MN) related to ice phenology and water chemistry from 1980 to present.

This includes:
	•	Annual or seasonal records of ice-on and ice-off dates, ice thickness, and duration of ice cover
	•	Temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles, especially late-fall and winter data
	•	Records of chloride, specific conductance, turbidity, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and color metrics
	•	Nutrient and biological indicators (total phosphorus, nitrogen, chlorophyll-a, algal bloom reports)
	•	Remote sensing analyses or satellite-derived datasets concerning freeze/thaw timing and water color
	•	Internal reports distinguishing climate-driven phenological changes from contamination-driven changes
	•	Communications with the City of Minneapolis, Minneapolis Park & Recreation Board, or Minnesota Pollution Control Agency regarding observed or suspected contamination, salinization, or water replacement events
	•	Research proposals, pilot projects, or vendor partnerships involving experimental water treatments or monitoring at Lake Harriet

Keywords: Lake Harriet, ice-on, ice-off, freeze-thaw, chloride contamination, specific conductance, dissolved organic carbon, Secchi depth, eutrophication, water replacement, Chain of Lakes
