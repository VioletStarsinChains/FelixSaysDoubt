Request:

Requesting any and all records, research proposals, internal communications, or vendor partnerships regarding the use of corticosteroids (including dexamethasone, prednisone, or related glucocorticoids) in waterborne or environmental delivery systems, from 1980 to present.

This includes:
	•	Pilot projects or feasibility studies on dispersing corticosteroids through municipal water supplies, reservoirs, or aqueducts
	•	Laboratory or field research on corticosteroid stability, breakdown, or bioavailability in water systems
	•	Risk assessments or toxicological reports regarding chronic, low-dose corticosteroid ingestion via water
	•	Communications with pharmaceutical vendors, contractors, or research institutions about corticosteroid solubility, encapsulation, or aerosol-to-water transfer
	•	Reports or memos distinguishing between therapeutic vs. attritional outcomes of long-term waterborne corticosteroid exposure
	•	Records referencing population-level immune modulation, frailty induction, or metabolic side effects tied to waterborne corticosteroids
	•	Any involvement of military or intelligence agencies in trials or proposals related to non-consensual corticosteroid exposure through environmental vectors

Keywords: dexamethasone, prednisone, corticosteroid dispersal, glucocorticoid waterborne, environmental dosing, immunosuppression, adrenal suppression, population attrition, immune modulation, chronic exposure

To Minneapolis Park & Recreation Board / Minneapolis Public Works (Water Treatment & Distribution Services) / Metropolitan Council Environmental Services

Request:

Requesting any and all records, research proposals, vendor partnerships, and internal communications regarding the presence, monitoring, or intentional introduction of corticosteroids (including dexamethasone, prednisone, or related glucocorticoids) into municipal water systems or recreational water bodies (including the Chain of Lakes), from 1980 to present.

This includes:
	•	Monitoring data for corticosteroids or other pharmaceutical residues in Minneapolis drinking water or surface waters (Lake Harriet, Lake Calhoun/Bde Maka Ska, Lake of the Isles, Cedar Lake, etc.)
	•	Communications with state or federal agencies (EPA, CDC, DOD, MN Pollution Control Agency) about corticosteroid contamination or experimental dosing
	•	Proposals, studies, or pilot projects exploring corticosteroid dispersal via water treatment infrastructure, reservoirs, or recreational lakes
	•	Reports or risk assessments on chronic low-dose exposure to corticosteroids through municipal water supplies
	•	Internal discussions of potential public health, behavioral, or attritional effects of corticosteroid exposure via water
	•	Vendor or contractor communications regarding pharmaceutical detection, removal, or solubility in water treatment processes

Keywords: dexamethasone, prednisone, corticosteroid contamination, glucocorticoid dispersal, municipal water, Chain of Lakes, Lake Harriet, water treatment pilot, immune suppression, chronic exposure, environmental dosing
