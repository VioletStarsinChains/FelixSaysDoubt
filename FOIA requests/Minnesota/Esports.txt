This includes:
	•	Records of corporate sponsorships, event funding, or promotional partnerships involving PepsiCo (Mountain Dew), energy drink brands, and Minnesota-based gaming events, esports leagues, or school/community tournaments.

	•	Documentation of public complaints, adverse event reports, or ethics reviews relating to synthetic dyes in energy drinks or sodas promoted at Minnesota gaming/esports events.
