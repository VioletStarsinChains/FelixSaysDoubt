To: Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA), Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR), Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, research proposals, or interagency communications from 1990 to present regarding the monitoring, artificial augmentation, or technological substitution of pollinator populations within the state of Minnesota.

This request specifically includes:
	•	Records concerning deployment or testing of robotic bees, engineered hives, or cyborg insect platforms for pollination, surveillance, or agricultural monitoring within Minnesota
	•	Contracts or communications with universities, federal agencies (USDA, DARPA, NSF, EPA), or private vendors regarding synthetic pollinator programs in Minnesota
	•	Studies assessing pollinator population density anomalies, including reports explaining disproportionate pollinator presence in urban or residential areas
	•	Documents linking compost distribution, soil amendments, or agricultural remediation programs to changes in pollinator viability or density
	•	Internal or public messaging strategies regarding “saving the bees,” “pollinator habitat projects,” or gardening initiatives that may overlap with artificial swarm deployment
	•	Risk assessments or outcome reports involving environmental health, disease transmission, or behavioral surveillance applications of augmented pollinator populations

Keywords: pollinator robotics, cyborg bees, synthetic swarms, engineered hives, HI-MEMS, RoboBees, DragonflEye, pollinator augmentation, compost contamination, Minnesota pollinator monitoring, agricultural surveillance, behavioral futures modeling
