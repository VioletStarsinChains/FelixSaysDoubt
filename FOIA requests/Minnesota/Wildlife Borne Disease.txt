Request:

Requesting any and all documents, interagency communications, research proposals, surveillance reports, or environmental health assessments from January 1, 2000 to present regarding wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) populations in residential and suburban environments as potential vectors of environmental contamination or adverse health outcomes.

This includes:
	•	Studies or monitoring data on microbial pathogens spread via wild turkey feces, feathers, or carcasses in urban/suburban areas (e.g., Salmonella, Campylobacter, Listeria, Clostridium, Francisella tularensis, avian influenza, West Nile virus).
	•	Environmental testing or incident reports linking wild turkey activity to contaminated playgrounds, schoolyards, or residential parks.
	•	Risk assessments of heavy metal, pesticide, herbicide, or microplastic transfer from urban soils into turkey droppings or feathers.
	•	Evaluations of turkeys as bridging vectors for tick-borne diseases (Lyme, babesiosis) between wild habitats and residential neighborhoods.
	•	Interagency discussions on mitigation strategies, population control, or communication plans regarding wild turkey contamination risks.
	•	Contracts, cooperative research agreements, or technology pilots involving USDA Wildlife Services or DARPA on urban/suburban turkey population management.

This request should also include any reports, studies, assessments, or interagency communications regarding the role of mechanical landscaping equipment (e.g., leafblowers, lawnmowers, trimmers) in the aerosolization and environmental redistribution of contaminants derived from wild turkey populations.

Specifically:
	•	Aerosolized dispersal of microbial pathogens (e.g., Salmonella, Campylobacter, Histoplasma, avian influenza) from dried feces or feather dust
	•	Redistribution of inorganic contaminants (e.g., heavy metals, pesticides, microplastics) through dust plumes
	•	Public health risks tied to allergenic proteins, fungal spores, or parasitic vectors carried in turkey residue
	•	Potential impacts of repeated mechanical aerosolization in residential neighborhoods, schoolyards, and other child-centered environments

Keywords: wild turkey, urban wildlife, fecal contamination, feather dust, playground safety, zoonotic pathogens, heavy metals, microplastics, pesticide residues, tularemia, avian influenza, vector-borne disease, leaf blowers, wildlife services

To: Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR)
Cc: Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) / U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, reports, interagency communications, population studies, or internal assessments from January 1, 2000 to present concerning the monitoring, management, or public health impacts of wild turkeys in Minnesota, particularly in residential or suburban environments.

This includes:
	•	Population tracking data, field surveys, or geographic distribution maps documenting wild turkey presence in urban or residential areas
	•	Reports or assessments of turkey feces, dropped feathers, or scavenging behavior as vectors of microbial pathogens (e.g., Salmonella, E. coli, avian influenza), parasites, or fungi
	•	Records of chemical or inorganic contaminant spread (e.g., heavy metals, pesticides, PFAS, or other environmental toxins) linked to turkey scavenging or droppings
	•	Public complaints or incident reports regarding wild turkeys fouling residential properties, playgrounds, or urban green spaces
	•	Communications with local governments or health agencies regarding leaf blowers, lawn care equipment, or other mechanical disturbance of turkey fecal/feather dust and its aerosolization
	•	Risk assessments, mitigation strategies, or public messaging concerning exposure risks from turkeys in neighborhoods, particularly for children or immunocompromised individuals
	•	Interagency correspondence with MDH, USFWS, or USDA APHIS Wildlife Services concerning zoonotic or environmental health risks associated with wild turkeys
