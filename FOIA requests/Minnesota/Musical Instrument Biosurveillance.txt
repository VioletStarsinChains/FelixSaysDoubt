Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, contracts, internal communications, oversight reports, or ethics board reviews concerning the use of musical instrumentation or performance equipment (including but not limited to electric guitar pickups, microphones, synthesizers, percussion sensors, or other signal-transducing devices) as biometric monitoring or data collection systems, from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Research conducted or funded through the University of Minnesota, Mayo Clinic, or other Minnesota institutions involving musical instruments as potential biometric or surveillance tools
	•	Contracts or grants involving state or federal funds awarded for projects exploring the integration of biometric sensing into music or performance technology
	•	Oversight records, IRB reviews, or ethics evaluations related to studies where music performance contexts were used for physiological or neurological data capture
	•	Internal communications discussing collaborations with private companies (musical instrument or audio equipment manufacturers) concerning the dual use of performance technology for biometric monitoring
	•	Reports or presentations submitted to MDH, MinnState, or the Minnesota State Arts Board addressing music technology research with biometric or public health implications
