To Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) / Minnesota Department of Public Safety

Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, technical specifications, research proposals, pilot program reports, or interagency communications from 1990 to present concerning the design, implementation, and evaluation of roadway ridge or rumble strip patterns installed on Minnesota highways, freeways, and secondary roads.

This includes:
	•	Technical specifications and design documents for groove/ridge spacing patterns used on Minnesota highways.
	•	Internal studies or vendor research on the neurological, physiological, or behavioral effects of specific rumble strip patterns on drivers (e.g., changes in alertness, mood, compliance, or decision-making).
	•	Records of pilot programs testing nonstandard or variable ridge patterns beyond conventional safety applications.
	•	Communications with federal agencies (FHWA, DoD, DARPA) regarding the dual-use potential of rumble strip or engineered roadway vibration systems for entrainment, behavioral influence, or field effect studies.
	•	Safety evaluations or adverse event reports related to unintended cognitive or physical effects of rumble strips beyond accident prevention.
	•	Contracts or correspondence with contractors/vendors supplying customized roadway groove patterns in Minnesota.

To U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) / Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) / Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)

Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, technical specifications, pilot program reports, contracts, or interagency communications from 1990 to present concerning the design, testing, or implementation of engineered roadway ridge or rumble strip patterns and their potential impacts on human cognition, physiology, or behavior.

This includes:
	•	Records of federally funded or contractor-led studies on the neurological and physiological effects of driving over specific rumble strip groove/ridge patterns (e.g., changes in alertness, compliance, mood, decision-making).
	•	Pilot program reports evaluating nonstandard or variable ridge designs as compared to conventional road safety rumble strips.
	•	Communications between DOT/FHWA and defense or intelligence agencies (e.g., DARPA, DoD) concerning the dual-use potential of roadway vibration systems for entrainment, neuromodulation, or behavioral influence.
	•	Oversight reviews, safety assessments, or adverse event reports referencing driver disorientation, cognitive effects, or atypical responses linked to rumble strip exposure.
	•	Contracts with engineering or construction vendors specifying unique ridge spacing or vibration patterns beyond standard highway safety norms.
