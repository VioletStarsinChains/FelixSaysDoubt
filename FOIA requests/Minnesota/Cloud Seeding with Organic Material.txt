Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, laboratory analyses, interagency communications, or oversight reports from 1990 to present concerning the use of nontraditional or organic-derived particulates in cloud seeding, weather modification, or precipitation enhancement projects within the State of Minnesota.

This includes:
	•	Records describing or authorizing the use of bone ash, cremated remains, keratin fibers, or other organic-derived particles as alternatives or supplements to conventional seeding materials (e.g., silver iodide, dry ice, salt).
	•	Laboratory testing or environmental monitoring of atmospheric effects from organic particulate seeding within Minnesota’s airspace.
	•	Contracts with third-party vendors or contractors conducting cloud seeding trials involving organic remains or bio-derived particulates.
	•	Oversight reports, environmental impact assessments, or ethics reviews addressing health or ecological risks tied to deploying organic materials in weather modification programs.
	•	Communications between DNR, MPCA, MDA, or water resource districts regarding the evaluation of organic particulates as condensation nuclei for weather modification.
