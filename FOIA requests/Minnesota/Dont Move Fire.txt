To: Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) / United States Department of Agriculture – Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA APHIS) / Department of Homeland Security (DHS) / Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, communications, modeling outputs, or investigative files from January 1, 2000 to present concerning Minnesota firewood movement restrictions (including county-by-county bans, “Don’t Move Firewood” public campaigns, and enforcement actions) with specific attention to climate impact modeling and geofenced experimental design.

This includes:
	•	Internal communications, policy drafts, or technical memos discussing A/B testing, control groups, or experimental design in relation to firewood movement restrictions
	•	Modeling or simulation outputs assessing the carbon cycle, greenhouse gas emissions, soil carbon sequestration, or forest microclimate changes tied to differing levels of firewood transport compliance
	•	Reports, datasets, or GIS layers showing regional ecological differences in areas with strict enforcement vs. relaxed enforcement, particularly in relation to vegetation cover, pest/pathogen prevalence, and forest composition
	•	Contracts, statements of work, or project deliverables involving federal or private-sector contractors (including Palantir Technologies, Accenture Federal Services, Deloitte, Booz Allen Hamilton) that analyze firewood transport patterns or integrate them into climate change acceleration or mitigation models
	•	Records describing the chemical, microbial, or fungal composition of transported firewood and its potential to alter soil microbiome balance or forest ecosystem resilience
	•	Interagency communications between Minnesota DNR, USDA APHIS, DHS, and contractors regarding the dual use of invasive species prevention data for climate or environmental modeling purposes
	•	Any studies, white papers, or pilot project reports exploring the use of firewood transport restrictions as a climate intervention lever, including those that explicitly or implicitly evaluate intentional or strategic acceleration of climate change effects

Keywords: firewood movement restriction, don’t move firewood, invasive species prevention, emerald ash borer, geofenced environmental experiment, A/B testing, biomass transport, climate change acceleration, carbon sequestration, soil microbiome, Palantir Technologies, Accenture Federal Services, Deloitte, Booz Allen Hamilton

	•	Modeling or simulation outputs assessing the carbon cycle, greenhouse gas emissions, soil carbon sequestration, or forest microclimate changes tied to differing levels of firewood transport compliance
	•	Reports, datasets, or GIS layers showing regional ecological differences in areas with strict enforcement vs. relaxed enforcement, particularly in relation to vegetation cover, pest/pathogen prevalence, and forest composition
	•	Records describing the chemical, microbial, or fungal composition of transported firewood and its potential to alter soil microbiome balance or forest ecosystem resilience
	•	Deliverables, slide decks, or executive summaries describing integration of firewood movement data into climate change acceleration or mitigation models
	•	Communications or agreements with Minnesota DNR, USDA APHIS, DHS, or CISA regarding the dual use of invasive species prevention data for climate or environmental modeling purposes
