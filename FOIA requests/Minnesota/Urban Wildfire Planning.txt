Request:

Requesting any and all records from 2010 to present concerning wildfire hazard modeling and continuity planning for the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metro area and the Duluth–Superior region.

This includes:
	•	Risk assessments, hazard models, or scenario documents describing wildfire movement from Canada into Minnesota.
	•	Records of secondary hazards involving residential hazmat storage (e.g., batteries, defoliants, chemical stockpiles) and their interaction with wildfire conditions.
	•	Interagency communications referencing the Duluth–Superior bridge or surrounding infrastructure as potential nodes for fungal, mold, or biological spread following a fire event.
	•	Contracts, technical reports, or deliverables from private contractors or universities modeling wildfire smoke patterns, downwind impacts, and continuity-of-operations scenarios in the Twin Cities.
	•	After-action reports, drills, or exercises that tested urban wildfire impact scenarios for Minneapolis–Saint Paul.

Minnesota State Public Records Request

To: Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR – Division of Forestry & Fire Management), Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA), Minnesota Department of Public Safety – Homeland Security and Emergency Management (HSEM)

Pursuant to the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act, I am requesting access to any and all records from 2010 to present concerning wildfire hazard mapping and urban hazard overlays for the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metro area and the Duluth–Superior region.

This includes:
	•	GIS hazard maps, shapefiles, or overlays identifying wildfire risk zones, fuel loads, or modeled fire spread into urban areas.
	•	Records specifically showing integration of residential hazmat clusters (e.g., lithium battery storage, chemical stockpiles, defoliants) into wildfire risk assessments.
	•	Internal communications, contractor reports, or technical deliverables that reference urban wildfire scenarios involving the Twin Cities metro.
	•	Biological hazard assessments referencing the Duluth–Superior bridge or other regional infrastructure as potential nodes for fungal or spore propagation following a fire event.
	•	Continuity of operations or emergency management drills/exercises involving wildfire encroachment from Canada into Minnesota.
