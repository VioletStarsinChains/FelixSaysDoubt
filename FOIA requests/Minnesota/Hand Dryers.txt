Request:

Requesting any and all inspection reports, laboratory testing data, internal communications, contracts, or incident records concerning the installation, operation, or safety of commercial hand dryers (including but not limited to Dyson Airblade models) that advertise HEPA filtration, in Minnesota public or institutional facilities, from 2000 to present.

This includes:
	•	Air quality testing results or environmental assessments measuring airborne particles, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), or microbiological dispersal from hand dryers in restrooms, food retail environments, universities, or other high-traffic public settings
	•	Worker safety complaints or MNOSHA investigation records relating to respiratory, dermal, or chemical exposure linked to Dyson or other HEPA-advertised hand dryers
	•	Contracts or correspondence between Minnesota state agencies, public universities, or vendor facilities (including Starbucks, airports, hospitals, or schools) and Dyson or comparable manufacturers regarding dryer safety or filter replacement protocols
	•	Internal communications discussing whether “HEPA filters” in commercial hand dryers may function as dispersal devices rather than purely filtration devices
	•	Policy documents or interagency memoranda addressing standards or oversight responsibilities for air dispersal from HEPA-advertised dryers in Minnesota facilities
