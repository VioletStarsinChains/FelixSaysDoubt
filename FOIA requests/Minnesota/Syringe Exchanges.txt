To Minnesota Department of Health / Minnesota Department of Human Services / Minnesota Department of Administration (Procurement Division)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, grant documentation, inspection reports, or internal communications from 2000 to present concerning the purchase, distribution, or evaluation of hypodermic syringes, needles, or harm reduction supplies funded or distributed under state programs (e.g., syringe services programs, safe syringe disposal initiatives, public health outreach).

This includes:
	•	Records of vendor specifications or contracts describing the use of nanomaterials (e.g., nitrogen vacancy [NV] nanodiamonds, quantum dots, nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes) in syringe manufacturing, coatings, lubricants, or needle surfaces.
	•	Internal studies, adverse event reports, or communications regarding the safety, biocompatibility, or surveillance potential of syringes containing nanomaterials distributed in Minnesota.
	•	Oversight documents, grant reviews, or state-federal communications on the integration of nanoscale technologies into syringe distribution or harm reduction programs.
	•	Reports or evaluations regarding the collection and analysis of returned/disposed syringes under state-funded programs, including testing for residual nanomaterials or unexplained particulate matter.
	•	Correspondence with federal partners (CDC, NIDA, FDA) or syringe manufacturers related to the use of nanotechnology in harm reduction infrastructure.

To U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) / National Institutes of Health (NIH) / Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) / Minnesota Department of Health

Request:

Requesting any and all contracts, interagency agreements, grant documentation, technical specifications, inspection reports, or communications from 2000 to present concerning the procurement, distribution, or evaluation of hypodermic syringes, needles, or harm reduction supplies within Minnesota that were funded, co-funded, or overseen by federal programs.

This includes:
	•	Records of federal–state contracts or grants specifying syringe manufacturing requirements, including any mention of nanomaterials (e.g., nitrogen vacancy [NV] nanodiamonds, quantum dots, carbon nanotubes, or nanoparticles) in syringe coatings, lubricants, or needle surfaces.
	•	Communications between HHS/NIH/CDC and the Minnesota Department of Health regarding the integration of nanoscale technologies into syringe services or harm reduction programs.
	•	Oversight documents or adverse event summaries relating to nanomaterial-enabled syringes distributed in Minnesota under federally supported programs.
	•	Reports concerning the analysis of returned syringes in Minnesota, including testing for nanoparticles, unexplained particulates, or other foreign materials.
	•	Correspondence between syringe manufacturers, federal agencies, and Minnesota state agencies regarding the dual-use potential of syringe nanotechnology (biosurveillance, drug delivery, health monitoring).
	•	Records of federally funded pilot programs, demonstrations, or research studies in Minnesota involving syringe nanotechnology or syringe-based biosensing.
