Request:

Requesting any and all records from January 1, 1990 to present concerning the design, funding, oversight, or evaluation of public cold-exposure events such as the “Polar Plunge” in Minnesota and other states, with specific attention to their use as behavioral data collection, stress testing, or biometric capture environments.

This includes:
	•	Contracts, proposals, or research studies involving cold-water immersion and immune, neurological, or compliance responses in mass populations.
	•	Interagency communications on partnerships with nonprofit organizations (e.g., Special Olympics Minnesota) regarding Polar Plunge or similar events.
	•	Datasets collected at such events, including biometric monitoring, injury reports, or psychological outcome tracking.
	•	Funding or collaboration with private vendors supplying wearable devices, cameras, or environmental sensors during cold-exposure charity events.
	•	Predictive modeling or behavioral futures projects linking forced cold exposure to compliance, group cohesion, or stress tolerance scoring.
	•	Public communication strategies framing Polar Plunge events as charitable or team-building while simultaneously serving data collection or research functions.

Keywords: cold-exposure stress test, mass biometric capture, charity event compliance, Polar Plunge, cold immersion physiology, behavioral futures modeling, group cohesion data.
