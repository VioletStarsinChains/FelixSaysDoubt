To Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) / Minnesota Department of Revenue (DOR – Motor Fuel Tax) / Minnesota Department of Commerce (Weights & Measures Division) / Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) / Metropolitan Council (Transportation Services)

Request:

Requesting any and all technical reports, datasets, audits, contractor deliverables, and internal or interagency communications concerning anomalies, adjustments, reconciliations, or unexplained variances among vehicle miles traveled (VMT) estimates, motor fuel tax receipts/returns, fuel sales volumes, and on-road emissions/activity data in Minnesota, from 2000 to present.

This includes:
• Datasets and methods for MnDOT’s VMT estimation (ATR/WIM sensor networks, seasonal adjustment factors, imputation/smoothing procedures), including documentation of sensor outages and any synthetic data used to fill gaps
• Communications and submissions related to HPMS (Highway Performance Monitoring System) reporting to FHWA, including any feedback or flags about Minnesota VMT anomalies or revisions
• Minnesota Department of Revenue records summarizing motor fuel tax receipts by fuel type (gasoline, diesel), adjustments, refunds, and audit findings; reconciliations between filed returns and estimated statewide consumption
• Minnesota Department of Commerce Weights & Measures inspection records and calibration/audit reports for retail fuel dispensers; any analyses addressing discrepancies between measured dispenser volumes and tax/consumption figures
• MPCA transportation emissions inventories (on-road mobile sources), MOVES model inputs/outputs, and any memos reconciling emissions activity data with MnDOT VMT and DOR fuel-tax data
• Interagency memoranda or meeting notes (MnDOT, DOR, Commerce/Weights & Measures, MPCA, Metropolitan Council) addressing “data smoothing,” “imputation,” “continuity adjustments,” or other methods used to align VMT, fuel tax, sales, and emissions datasets
• Contracts, SOWs, or deliverables from third-party vendors (e.g., traffic data, probe data, or analytics providers such as INRIX, StreetLight, HERE, or similar) used to estimate or backcast VMT; any evaluations of accuracy or known bias
• Any analyses comparing Minnesota refinery/terminal throughput or pipeline receipts with reported retail fuel sales and motor fuel tax data, and documents discussing unexplained gaps
• Records or correspondence addressing population or registration-based baselines (vehicle registrations, odometer statements at title/inspection) used to validate VMT/fuel demand, including any noted inconsistencies or adjustments

Keywords: VMT, vehicle miles traveled, HPMS, ATR, WIM, data imputation, data smoothing, motor fuel tax, fuel receipts, dispenser calibration, Weights & Measures, refinery throughput, MOVES inventory, on-road emissions, reconciliation, anomaly, variance

To Metropolitan Council (Transportation Services) / Minnesota Department of Transportation – Metro District / Minnesota Department of Revenue (Motor Fuel Tax Division) / Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA)

Request:

Requesting any and all datasets, reports, audits, or internal communications concerning anomalies, adjustments, or unexplained variances between measured or estimated vehicle activity and motor fuel consumption in the Twin Cities metropolitan area, from 2000 to present.

This includes:
	•	Traffic volume data (automatic traffic recorder counts, weigh-in-motion stations, corridor-level monitoring) for the Twin Cities metro area, including documentation of imputation, smoothing, or “continuity adjustments” used to fill sensor gaps
	•	Metropolitan Council transportation demand models and reconciliation documents comparing projected vehicle miles traveled (VMT) with observed fuel sales or tax data
	•	Minnesota Department of Revenue records summarizing motor fuel tax receipts attributable to the seven-county metro region, and any memos addressing discrepancies between reported consumption and MnDOT/Met Council VMT data
	•	MPCA on-road emissions inventory data for the Twin Cities metro (MOVES model inputs and outputs) and internal correspondence regarding reconciliation with MnDOT/Met Council VMT estimates and fuel tax receipts
	•	Interagency communications or meeting notes involving MnDOT Metro District, Met Council, DOR, and MPCA regarding VMT/fuel demand inconsistencies in the metro area
	•	Contracts, deliverables, or validation reports from third-party traffic data vendors (e.g., probe data providers such as INRIX, StreetLight, HERE) used in the Twin Cities metro, and any evaluations of accuracy or anomalies

Keywords: vehicle miles traveled, VMT, Twin Cities, fuel sales, motor fuel tax, data imputation, data smoothing, ATR counts, WIM stations, probe data, MOVES inventory, reconciliation, variance, anomaly

⸻ 

To Metropolitan Council (Metro Transit Division) / Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) / Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) / Minnesota Department of Public Safety – State Fire Marshal Division

Request:

Requesting any and all contracts, internal communications, operational records, or oversight reports concerning the use of Metro Transit buses, light rail, or support vehicles for the transport of non-passenger cargo, hazardous materials, or other “inventory,” from 2000 to present.

This includes:
	•	Contracts or subcontracts for Metro Transit vehicles to move freight, cargo, or hazardous substances under arrangements with other state or federal agencies
	•	Fuel allocation records, bulk fuel purchase summaries, and reconciliation documents showing Metro Transit fleet fuel consumption vs. reported passenger miles
	•	Internal memoranda or meeting notes discussing use of buses, trains, or support vehicles for covert or dual-use transport (including terms such as “special cargo,” “non-passenger load,” or “inventory”)
	•	Safety audits, incident reports, or MPCA/Fire Marshal inspection records referencing storage or carriage of hazardous materials on Metro Transit property or within fleet vehicles
	•	Interagency correspondence (Met Council, MnDOT, MPCA, DPS) concerning reconciliation of Metro Transit fleet mileage/fuel use with observed ridership trends
	•	Vendor or contractor records for outfitting Metro Transit vehicles with storage, containment, or air handling modifications inconsistent with normal passenger service

Keywords: Metro Transit, Metropolitan Council, non-passenger cargo, hazardous materials, dual-use vehicle, bulk fuel allocation, ridership reconciliation, special cargo, inventory transport
