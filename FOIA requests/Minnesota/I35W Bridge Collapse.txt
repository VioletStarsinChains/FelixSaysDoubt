To DHS / FEMA / NTSB / DARPA

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, internal communications, or contractor reports referencing the I-35W bridge collapse in Minneapolis, Minnesota (August 1, 2007) in connection with behavioral modeling, population response analysis, or cognitive resilience research, from 2006 to present.

This includes:
	•	Post-incident studies on crowd behavior, evacuation patterns, and public panic during the collapse
	•	Research into communication dynamics, rumor propagation, and information control following the event
	•	Use of the I-35W bridge collapse as a case study for predictive modeling of human behavior in disasters
	•	Contractor or university projects funded under DHS, FEMA, or DARPA programs analyzing the collapse from a behavioral or cognitive standpoint
	•	Interagency communications regarding behavioral telemetry collection during the incident, including applications to resilience, compliance, or predictive analytics
	•	Any reports tying the collapse into broader behavioral futures markets or infrastructure-based behavioral modeling programs

Keywords: I-35W bridge collapse, Minneapolis, behavioral modeling, crowd behavior, evacuation, panic response, resilience metrics, disaster psychology, predictive analytics, behavioral futures

To Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) / Minnesota Department of Public Safety (DPS)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, internal communications, research proposals, or contractor reports referencing the I-35W bridge collapse in Minneapolis, Minnesota (August 1, 2007) in connection with behavioral modeling, public response analysis, or cognitive resilience research, from 2006 to present.

This includes:
	•	State or contractor studies on crowd behavior, evacuation, and public panic during or after the collapse
	•	Analyses of communication dynamics, rumor propagation, and information control in the immediate aftermath
	•	Reports using the I-35W collapse as a behavioral case study for predictive modeling, resilience, or disaster psychology
	•	Internal communications between MnDOT, DPS, and federal agencies (DHS, FEMA, NTSB, DARPA) concerning behavioral modeling linked to the incident
	•	Any collaboration with academic institutions or private contractors on behavioral telemetry or predictive analytics tied to the bridge collapse
	•	Assessments of policy, emergency planning, or public safety training influenced by behavioral findings from the collapse

To University of Minnesota (Office of the Vice President for Research / Institutional Review Board / School of Public Health / Department of Psychology)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, grant proposals, research studies, internal communications, or contractor reports referencing the I-35W bridge collapse in Minneapolis, Minnesota (August 1, 2007) in connection with behavioral modeling, public response, or cognitive resilience research, from 2006 to present.

This includes:
	•	Research projects examining crowd behavior, evacuation patterns, panic responses, or resilience during and after the collapse
	•	Public health or psychology studies analyzing trauma, rumor propagation, or communication dynamics in affected populations
	•	Engineering, transportation, or emergency management studies that incorporated behavioral modeling or predictive analytics alongside structural failure analysis
	•	Internal communications or collaborations between the University of Minnesota and MnDOT, DPS, DHS, FEMA, NTSB, DARPA, or other federal agencies regarding behavioral research tied to the collapse
	•	Records of federal or state grants awarded for behavioral, psychological, or neurocognitive research using the I-35W bridge collapse as a case study
	•	Reports addressing how behavioral findings influenced subsequent policy, disaster preparedness, or resilience training programs
