Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, contracts, inspection reports, internal communications, or interagency memoranda concerning the use of large-scale solar panel arrays, solar thermal systems, or concentrated solar facilities for organic desiccation, waste drying, or mortality management in Minnesota, from 2000 to present.

This includes:
	•	MPCA or Commerce-funded studies evaluating the use of solar energy for drying or processing agricultural waste, biosolids, or livestock mortalities
	•	Contracts or pilot projects with private solar developers or waste management firms regarding the co-location of solar farms and organic waste treatment/drying systems
	•	Internal communications or oversight documents discussing potential dual-use applications of solar infrastructure for organic material desiccation or accelerated decomposition
	•	Environmental assessments or public health reviews by MDH concerning emissions, odors, or biohazard risks associated with solar-powered drying of organic matter
	•	Interagency correspondence between MPCA, Commerce, MDA, and MDH on the feasibility or risks of solar-based drying of animal mortalities, biosolids, or similar organic waste streams
