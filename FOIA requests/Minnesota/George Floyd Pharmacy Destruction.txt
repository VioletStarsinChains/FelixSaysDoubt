This includes:
	•	Records of DEA or FDA oversight of controlled substances storage or diversion at affected pharmacies
	•	Incident reports on compounding pharmacies that were damaged or destroyed
	•	Compliance audits or insurance claims submitted in relation to lost pharmaceutical inventory
	•	Communications regarding the safeguarding, loss, or tracking of controlled substances during the civil unrest

To Department of Defense / Department of Justice / Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, communications, research proposals, or interagency assessments concerning the destruction of pharmacies and compounding facilities in the Twin Cities metropolitan area (Minneapolis–Saint Paul, MN) during the George Floyd protests in 2020, particularly in relation to risk assessment modeling and behavioral futures markets.

This includes:
	•	Analyses of how civil unrest and targeted infrastructure damage (including pharmacies) were used as data points for attrition simulations
	•	Records referencing pharmaceutical inventories (cromolyn sodium, ketamine, or related compounds) and their potential role in covert medical experimentation or suppression of evidence
	•	Contracts, pilot programs, or vendor communications exploring the use of civil unrest events as compliance stress-tests for communities dependent on critical medical supply chains
	•	Interagency discussions on how destruction of health infrastructure during protests impacted predictive modeling of population resilience and medical vulnerability

Keywords: Twin Cities pharmacy fire, George Floyd protests, behavioral futures, attrition simulation, cromolyn, ketamine, compounding pharmacy, Lloyd's Pharmacy, compliance anchors, risk assessment, health infrastructure sabotage

To Department of Justice (DOJ) / Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) / Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)

Request:

Requesting any and all investigative records, internal communications, and compliance reviews related to the destruction of pharmacies, compounding facilities, or other health-related infrastructure in the Twin Cities metropolitan area (Minneapolis–Saint Paul, MN) during the civil unrest following the death of George Floyd in May 2020.

This includes:
	•	Damage and loss reports involving pharmaceutical inventories, particularly controlled substances or compounded medications
	•	Oversight documents regarding compliance failures or diversion risks arising from destroyed or compromised facilities
	•	Records discussing possible patterns of targeted attacks on health infrastructure during the protests
	•	Interagency communications assessing the impact of such losses on public safety and medical continuity of care

Keywords: Twin Cities pharmacy fire, compounding facility, George Floyd protests, controlled substances diversion, DEA compliance, FBI investigations, infrastructure targeting, public safety

To Department of Defense / Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) / Department of Homeland Security (DHS)

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, assessments, contractor communications, or research proposals regarding the use of the Twin Cities civil unrest of 2020 as cover for the destruction of health-related facilities, including pharmacies and compounding operations, with particular attention to the potential elimination of evidence relevant to covert medical experimentation or behavioral futures markets.

This includes:
	•	Analyses of whether certain facilities were strategically targeted rather than incidentally damaged during unrest
	•	Interagency discussions on the potential dual use of civil unrest events as both behavioral stress tests and opportunities for evidence suppression
	•	Contracts or pilot studies involving the exploitation of urban unrest for risk assessment modeling, attrition simulations, or compliance testing
	•	Records of inventories (including cromolyn sodium, ketamine, or related compounds) destroyed during these incidents, and how those losses factored into predictive modeling or liability forecasting
