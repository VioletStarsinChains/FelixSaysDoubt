Request:

Pursuant to the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act, Minn. Stat. Ch. 13, I am requesting access to and copies of any and all records, reports, contracts, audits, communications, or compliance reviews concerning the use of incentive-responsiveness as a variable or marker in predictive modeling, behavioral analytics, anomaly classification, or related systems from 2008 to present.

This includes:
	•	Documents describing how responsiveness to food rewards, financial incentives, consumer opportunities, or social rewards was measured, tracked, or weighted in classification systems.
	•	Records evaluating whether lack of incentive-responsiveness could result from disability, chronic illness, fatigue-related conditions, or medical barriers.
	•	Contracts, correspondence, or agreements with contractors (including but not limited to Palantir Technologies Inc.) referencing incentive-responsiveness in data models.
	•	Internal or external reviews addressing whether incentive-responsiveness modeling complies with ADA, civil rights, or disability-protection obligations.
	•	Risk assessments, policy documents, or whistleblower reports concerning the disparate impact of using incentive-responsiveness in benefit eligibility, anomaly classification, or digital twin modeling.
