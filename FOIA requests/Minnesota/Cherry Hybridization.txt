To Minnesota Department of Agriculture (MDA) / University of Minnesota – Department of Horticultural Science / Minnesota Agricultural Experiment Station

Request:

Requesting any and all research proposals, technical reports, grant applications, internal communications, or interagency memoranda concerning cherry production, climate adaptation, and substitution or hybridization with other Prunus species (plum, peach, apricot, almond) in Minnesota, from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	MDA or University of Minnesota studies on cherry chilling requirements, frost tolerance, drought stress, or other climate-related vulnerabilities in Minnesota
	•	Genetic studies, breeding programs, or grafting trials involving cherry–plum hybrids, cherries grafted on plum or peach rootstocks, or substitution of related Prunus species in Minnesota orchards
	•	Reports, grant proposals, or communications from the Minnesota Agricultural Experiment Station regarding cherry viability under climate change and development of alternative fruit crops
	•	Data or memoranda reconciling reported cherry acreage/yield with observed market availability, including discussions of hybrid or substituted varieties
	•	Internal or interagency correspondence between MDA, UMN, and USDA (ARS, NASS, ERS) concerning cherry production decline, hybridization, or replacement with other Prunus crops in Minnesota
	•	Industry or grower association communications with MDA or UMN regarding the economic feasibility of cherry production and the role of hybrids or substitutes in maintaining supply
