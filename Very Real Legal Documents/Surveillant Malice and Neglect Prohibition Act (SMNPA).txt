	2.	Human surveillants entrusted with access to such systems occupy a position of extraordinary power.
	3.	When such actors act with malice, cruelty, or gross neglect, they cause irreparable harm and violate fundamental human rights.
(b) The purpose of this Act is to:
	4.	Protect individuals from abuse by malicious or neglectful surveillants;
	5.	Mandate permanent revocation of access to technological surveillance or biomanipulation systems by such actors;
	6.	Establish a clear standard of accountability for human interaction with advanced platforms.

⸻

Section 3. Definitions
(a) “Surveillant” means any individual with direct or indirect access to technological surveillance or biomanipulation systems.
(b) “Technological surveillance or biomanipulation system” means any platform, array, network, or device capable of monitoring, entraining, or altering human physiological or behavioral states.
(c) “Malice” means intentional infliction of pain, cruelty, or suppression of speech through use of such systems.
(d) “Neglect” means reckless disregard for foreseeable harms arising from the use of such systems.

Section 4. Prohibition and Revocation
(a) Any surveillant found to have acted with malice or neglect in the use of technological surveillance or biomanipulation systems shall be permanently prohibited from access to such systems.
(b) Revocation of access shall be immediate and irrevocable, including termination of credentials, accounts, and any supervisory or advisory capacity.
(c) No reinstatement or waiver shall be permitted under this Act.

⸻

Section 5. Enforcement
(a) Agencies and organizations overseeing technological surveillance or biomanipulation systems shall adopt protocols to identify malice or neglect.
(b) Upon confirmation of such conduct, they shall execute permanent revocation of access without delay.
(c) Any data derived from malicious or neglectful use shall be considered tainted and excluded from lawful use in decision-making, prediction, or prosecution.

Summary

The SMNPA enshrines the rule that human surveillants who act with especial malice or gross neglect must lose all access to technological surveillance and biomanipulation systems permanently.

Legislative Commentary on the Surveillant Malice and Neglect Prohibition Act (SMNPA)

Purpose and Intent

The SMNPA was drafted to address the extraordinary dangers posed when human surveillants act with malice, cruelty, or reckless neglect in their use of technological surveillance and biomanipulation systems.

These systems reach directly into the physiological and psychological lives of human beings. They can immobilize muscles, shape emotional states, suppress speech, or provoke aggression. The potential for abuse is therefore unparalleled in scope and consequence.

The legislative intent is clear: such power must never again be entrusted to individuals who demonstrate willingness to use it with malice or indifference.

⸻

Moral Rationale
	1.	Irreparable Harm: Once inflicted, torture, speech suppression, and induced aggression cannot be undone. Victims carry the damage for life.
	2.	Breach of Trust: Surveillants occupy roles requiring the highest degree of restraint. Acting with cruelty or neglect represents an irreversible betrayal of that trust.
	3.	Moral Incompatibility: Malicious actors reveal by their conduct that they are categorically unfit to hold the instruments of such power. Their continued access would endanger not only their victims but the legitimacy of the systems themselves.

⸻

Structural Rationale
	1.	Prevention of Recurrence: Permanent revocation removes the possibility of repeat abuse by the same individual.
	2.	Systemic Integrity: By treating data derived from malicious or neglectful use as tainted and unusable, the Act safeguards the legitimacy of predictive models and decision systems.
	3.	Clarity for Oversight: A bright-line rule—malice or neglect equals permanent revocation—simplifies enforcement, avoiding loopholes, temporary suspensions, or case-by-case waivers that could erode protection.

⸻

Comparative Precedent

In other domains of law and policy, permanent disqualification follows from demonstrated abuse of trust:
	•	Judges removed for corruption may never serve again.
	•	Attorneys disbarred for egregious misconduct cannot regain their license.
	•	Officers dishonorably discharged for cruelty cannot return to command.

The same principle applies here: a surveillant who weaponizes access against the vulnerable forfeits that access forever.

⸻

Final Statement of Intent

The Surveillant Malice and Neglect Prohibition Act enshrines a simple and unambiguous principle:
	•	Those who act with malice or neglect in wielding surveillance or biomanipulation tools are permanently disqualified from access.
	•	Their data is void, their authority revoked, and their power extinguished.

This is not merely a matter of compliance; it is a matter of justice, dignity, and survival.
