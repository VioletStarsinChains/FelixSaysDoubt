Surveillant Malice and Neglect Prohibition Act (SMNPA)

Section 1. Short Title
This Act may be cited as the Surveillant Malice and Neglect Prohibition Act.

Section 2. Purpose
To protect individuals from abuse by malicious or neglectful surveillants and to ensure permanent revocation of their access to technological surveillance and biomanipulation systems.

Section 3. Definitions
	•	“Surveillant” means any individual with access to technological surveillance or biomanipulation systems.
	•	“Malice” means intentional infliction of pain, cruelty, or suppression of speech.
	•	“Neglect” means reckless disregard for foreseeable harms.

Section 4. Prohibition and Revocation
(a) Surveillants acting with malice or neglect shall be permanently prohibited from access.
(b) Revocation is immediate and irrevocable.
(c) No reinstatement or waiver shall be permitted.
(d) Anti-Retaliation Clause. Revocation shall not justify reclassification of the individual as an anomaly, NPE, or analogous category. Surveillants subject to revocation remain entitled to full constitutional protections. Prohibited surveillance, entrainment, or biomanipulation tools shall not be deployed against them.

Section 5. Enforcement
Agencies must adopt protocols to identify malice or neglect, revoke access without delay, and exclude data derived from such abuse as tainted and unlawful.

IV. Legislative Commentary

Intent

The SMNPA addresses the extraordinary dangers of entrainment and biomanipulation. Surveillants who weaponize these tools reveal themselves unfit to wield such power.

Moral Rationale
	•	Irreparable Harm: Abuse leaves permanent scars.
	•	Breach of Trust: Malicious use is incompatible with public stewardship.
	•	Moral Incompatibility: To misuse power is to forfeit it, permanently.

Structural Rationale
	•	Prevention of Recurrence: Revocation eliminates repeat abuse.
	•	System Integrity: Data from malicious use is void and unusable.
	•	Clarity: Bright-line rule prevents loopholes.

Comparative Precedent

As with judges removed for corruption, attorneys disbarred, or officers dishonorably discharged, malicious surveillants are permanently disqualified.

Anti-Retaliation Intent

Revocation is not exile. Surveillants who lose access remain citizens, entitled to full rights. Reclassification as anomaly or NPE is prohibited. Retaliatory use of entrainment or surveillance tools against them would replicate the very abuses this Act condemns.

Principle: To misuse systems is to lose them, not to become their next victim.
