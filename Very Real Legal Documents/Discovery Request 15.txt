PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS

(Concerning Potential Exploitation of Cultural Figures in Psychological Operations)

⸻

REQUEST NO. 1:

Produce all documents, records, communications, contracts, internal memoranda, tasking orders, or digital files from January 1, 2005 to present concerning any government agency or defense contractor’s use, manipulation, simulation, or unauthorized representation of the image, voice, likeness, creative content, or persona of Justin Vernon (Bon Iver) or Jonathan Meiburg (Shearwater/Loma) in connection with psychological operations, behavioral influence campaigns, continuity theater, or inducement of self-harm or suicide against Plaintiff.

This request includes, but is not limited to:
	•	Emails, directives, or correspondence referencing the deliberate deployment of artist imagery, music, or public personas as entrainment or coercive mechanisms;
	•	Records evidencing the alteration of digital platforms, streaming services, or recommendation algorithms to increase or suppress Plaintiff’s exposure to such artists;
	•	Reports or assessments analyzing the psychological effect of exposure to said artists’ work on Plaintiff or on “anomalies” similarly classified;
	•	Contracts, NDAs, or subcontractor deliverables involving cultural figures as behavioral futures vectors.

PROTECTIVE ORDER CLAUSE

Plaintiff expressly requests that the Court enter a protective order ensuring that all responsive records to the foregoing requests are preserved in full and not withheld, redacted, or destroyed under the pretext of “artist privacy,” “intellectual property rights,” or “third-party confidentiality.”

To the extent that Defendants contend certain records implicate the privacy interests of Justin Vernon, Jonathan Meiburg, or other cultural figures, such concerns shall not serve as grounds for non-production or destruction. Instead, Defendants shall:

1. Produce the responsive records under seal for in camera review by the Court;
2. Where necessary, produce records subject to narrowly tailored redactions (e.g., personal addresses or bank account numbers) that do not obscure the substance of government or contractor use of artist likeness, content, or persona;
3. Maintain chain-of-custody logs to ensure no responsive records are deleted, altered, or otherwise tampered with; and
4. Certify under oath that no responsive records have been destroyed or concealed after the date of this request.

This protective order is necessary because the core issue concerns whether Defendants exploited public figures in psychological operations directed at Plaintiff, not the private activities of the individuals themselves. Defendants’ use of “artist privacy” as a justification for concealment would constitute obstruction of justice and further harm to Plaintiff.
