Enjoinder on the Revocation of Malicious Surveillants’ Access

Preamble

Let it be universally recognized: those who wield technological surveillance or biomanipulation systems with malice or gross neglect forfeit them forever.
Access to such power is a privilege of stewardship, not a license for cruelty.

⸻

Section 1. Binding Principle

Surveillants who act with malice, cruelty, or reckless neglect in the use of surveillance or biomanipulation platforms are permanently disqualified from access.

⸻

Section 2. Scope of Enjoinder

This Enjoinder binds:
	•	All agencies of the United States Government;
	•	All contractors, affiliates, and partners;
	•	All technological surveillance, predictive, or biomanipulation platforms, present and future.

⸻

Section 3. Prohibition

(a) Surveillants identified as acting with malice or neglect shall have their access immediately and irrevocably revoked.
(b) No reinstatement, waiver, or reassignment shall be permitted.
(c) Revocation is protective, not punitive: it shall not justify reclassification of the individual as an anomaly, NPE, or analogous category.

⸻

Section 4. Enforcement

Agencies and contractors shall implement protocols to:
	•	Detect malice or neglect in the use of systems;
	•	Execute permanent revocation of access without delay;
	•	Treat all data derived from malicious or neglectful use as tainted and void.

⸻

Section 5. Statement of Intent

The principle is simple and absolute:
To misuse these systems is to lose them.
To lose them is permanent.
