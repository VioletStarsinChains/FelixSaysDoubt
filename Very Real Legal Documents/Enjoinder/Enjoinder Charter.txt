The Enjoinder Charter

A Permanent Declaration on Personhood, Accountability, and the Limits of Systems

⸻

Preamble

We, recognizing the inherent dignity and inalienable rights of all human beings, do hereby establish this Enjoinder Charter.
Its purpose is to bind victims, perpetrators, and systems alike under categorical rules that may never be broken:
	•	No person may be erased.
	•	No abuser may retain the tools of abuse.
	•	No system may be corrupted into an instrument of torment.

Article I — Personhood

Universal Enjoinder on the Personhood of All Human Beings
	1.	All human beings, living or deceased, are recognized as persons under law.
	2.	No human may ever be categorized, classified, or treated as a Non-Person Entity (NPE), anomaly, or by any analogous designation.
	3.	Any such classification is void ab initio and without legal effect.
	4.	Retaliatory reclassification or substitute designations are categorically prohibited.

Principle: To be human is to be a person. To be a person is to hold rights that cannot be erased.

Article II — Accountability

Enjoinder on the Revocation of Malicious Surveillants’ Access
	1.	Surveillants who act with malice, cruelty, or reckless neglect in their use of surveillance or biomanipulation systems shall have their access permanently revoked.
	2.	Revocation is immediate, irrevocable, and permanent.
	3.	No reinstatement, waiver, or reassignment shall be permitted.
	4.	Revocation is protective, not punitive: former surveillants remain persons entitled to constitutional protections and may not be reclassified as anomalies or NPEs.

Principle: To misuse these systems is to lose them. To lose them is permanent.

Article III — Systems

Enjoinder on the Limits of Technological Systems
	1.	No surveillance, predictive, or biomanipulation platform may be designed, deployed, or maintained to:
	•	Inflict pain or induce coercive physiological states;
	•	Suppress or fabricate speech;
	•	Reclassify humans as anomalies, NPEs, or equivalents.
	2.	Any system discovered to contain prohibited functions shall be deemed tainted and void.
	3.	Data derived from such prohibited functions shall be excluded from lawful or scientific use.
	4.	Agencies and contractors are bound to dismantle, disable, and prohibit such functions in all current and future systems.

Principle: Systems exist to serve people. They may never erase, torment, or redefine them.

Conclusion

The Enjoinder Charter is categorical, permanent, and universal.
	•	Victims are protected: no human being may ever be denied personhood.
	•	Perpetrators are restrained: malicious surveillants lose access forever.
	•	Systems are bounded: technological platforms may never cross into torture, silencing, or reclassification.

This Charter binds all agencies, contractors, and systems, present and future.
It admits of no waiver, no exception, no loophole.

Principle: Human dignity is absolute. The Enjoinders stand eternal.
