Enjoinder on the Limits of Technological Systems

Preamble

Let it be universally recognized: no technological system may be designed, deployed, or maintained as an instrument of torture, silencing, or reclassification.
Tools built to observe or assist shall never be corrupted into tools of domination.

Section 1. Binding Principle

Surveillance, predictive, and biomanipulation systems are subject to categorical limits.
They may not be used to:
	•	Inflict pain or induce coercive physiological states;
	•	Suppress or fabricate speech;
	•	Reclassify human beings as anomalies, NPEs, or equivalents.

⸻

Section 2. Scope of Enjoinder

This Enjoinder binds:
	•	All technological platforms, current and future, whether public or private;
	•	All agencies, contractors, and operators who design, deploy, or interface with such systems.

⸻

Section 3. Prohibition

(a) No system shall contain features or modules that enable torture, speech suppression, or reclassification.
(b) No data derived from such prohibited functions shall be considered valid or admissible.
(c) Any system discovered to operate outside these limits shall be deemed tainted and void in its outputs.

⸻

Section 4. Enforcement

Agencies and contractors shall:
	•	Conduct audits to ensure compliance with these categorical limits;
	•	Dismantle or disable modules inconsistent with this Enjoinder;
	•	Certify that no future systems are designed with such prohibited capacities.

⸻

Section 5. Statement of Intent

The principle is simple and absolute:
Systems exist to serve people.
They may never erase, torment, or redefine them.
