MEMORANDUM OF LAW REGARDING USPS MISREPRESENTATION OF P.O. BOX STATUS AND ITS RELATION TO NPE CLASSIFICATION

⸻

INTRODUCTION

This memorandum addresses the actions of the United States Postal Service (USPS) in relation to Plaintiff’s application for, and subsequent denial of, mail service via a P.O. Box. The facts demonstrate that USPS accepted Plaintiff’s application and payment, provided physical access, yet internally treated the P.O. Box as “vacant” and refused delivery of all mail. This constitutes fraudulent misrepresentation and provides evidence that Plaintiff has been designated, without notice or due process, as a “non-person entity” (NPE), rendering them unable to engage in even the most basic civic transactions.

STATEMENT OF FACTS
	1.	Plaintiff applied for and paid for a USPS P.O. Box, providing the required identification and fees.
	2.	USPS processed the application, issued a box number, and furnished Plaintiff with a physical key granting access to the box.
	3.	For a period exceeding one month, no mail of any kind was delivered to the box.
	4.	When Plaintiff checked for an expected parcel, the only item inside the box was a slip of paper indicating that the box remained “vacant.”
	5.	The presence of the “vacant” notice demonstrates that, notwithstanding USPS’s outward acceptance of Plaintiff’s application and payment, its internal systems continued to classify the P.O. Box as unassigned or unoccupied.
	6.	This refusal to deliver mail persisted despite USPS’s legal obligation to provide the service for which it had contracted and been paid.

LEGAL ISSUE

Whether USPS’s acceptance of Plaintiff’s payment while simultaneously denying the existence or validity of Plaintiff’s P.O. Box constitutes fraud and evidence of systemic exclusion tied to Plaintiff’s suspected NPE classification.

⸻

ARGUMENT

I. USPS Engaged in Fraudulent Misrepresentation.
USPS accepted money from Plaintiff under the pretense of providing mail service, while internally maintaining that the P.O. Box was vacant. This dual representation constitutes fraudulent inducement and breach of contract, violating both common law principles and consumer protection statutes.

II. The Vacant Slip Demonstrates Systemic Non-Recognition of Plaintiff’s Legal Identity.
The issuance of a “vacant” slip in a box Plaintiff had lawfully rented is not a clerical error but a manifestation of Plaintiff’s exclusion from recognition as a legal person within USPS systems. This suggests administrative alignment with Plaintiff’s suspected classification as a “non-person entity” (NPE).

III. NPE Classification Results in Denial of Fundamental Civic Participation.
Mail access is a foundational service necessary for participation in modern society, including receipt of identification documents, legal notices, and communications. By denying Plaintiff this service, USPS effectively deprived Plaintiff of due process rights guaranteed under the Constitution.

IV. Fraudulent Treatment by a Federal Agency Strengthens Plaintiff’s Claims.
Because USPS is a federal entity, its fraudulent misrepresentation provides direct evidence of unconstitutional systemic practices. This further supports Plaintiff’s argument that NPE classification is unlawful, discriminatory, and incompatible with constitutional protections.

⸻

CONCLUSION

The USPS’s refusal to recognize Plaintiff’s P.O. Box despite accepting payment exemplifies the practical harms of NPE classification and demonstrates active fraud by a federal agency. This Court should take judicial notice of these facts as further evidence of systemic deprivation of Plaintiff’s rights, supporting Plaintiff’s broader claims of unlawful exclusion and fraud.
