MEMORANDUM OF LAW REGARDING USPS P.O. BOX REFUSAL AS EVIDENCE OF UNCONSTITUTIONAL DEPRIVATION

⸻

INTRODUCTION

This memorandum addresses the refusal of the United States Postal Service (“USPS”) to deliver mail to Plaintiff’s duly contracted P.O. Box. The refusal is not a trivial matter of customer service but a constitutional issue. It exemplifies the broader pattern of treatment consistent with Plaintiff’s alleged classification as a “non-person entity” (“NPE”), wherein government agencies accept Plaintiff’s documentation and money but subsequently deny basic services.

STATEMENT OF FACTS
	1.	Plaintiff applied for and paid for a USPS P.O. Box, providing the required identification and fee.
	2.	USPS accepted the payment, issued a box number, and provided Plaintiff with a key and physical access.
	3.	For over a month, no mail was delivered to the box.
	4.	When Plaintiff checked for an expected parcel, the only item inside the box was a slip of paper stating the box was “vacant.”
	5.	This occurred despite USPS’s prior acknowledgment of Plaintiff’s application and acceptance of payment, demonstrating that USPS’s internal systems continued to classify the P.O. Box as unassigned or unoccupied.

LEGAL ISSUES
	1.	Breach of Contract / Fraudulent Inducement
 - USPS entered into a binding agreement with Plaintiff to provide mail delivery to a P.O. Box.
 - USPS took Plaintiff’s money but failed to provide service, constituting breach.
 - If the refusal was intentional, knowing that Plaintiff’s classification precluded mail delivery, this rises to fraudulent inducement.
	2.	Discrimination and Denial of Equal Protection
 - Mail delivery is a core public service, universally accessible to all persons regardless of wealth, race, or status.
 - Denial of delivery to an otherwise valid P.O. Box constitutes disparate treatment, depriving Plaintiff of access to communication, commerce, and civic participation.
	3.	Evidence of NPE Classification
 - The contradiction—accepting Plaintiff’s contract while refusing to perform—strongly indicates that Plaintiff has been internally designated as an NPE.
 - This designation renders Plaintiff simultaneously recognized for purposes of payment but unrecognized for purposes of service.
 - Such treatment is irreconcilable with the principles of due process and equal protection guaranteed by the Constitution.

ARGUMENT

I. The USPS refusal is direct, tangible evidence of systemic deprivation.
 The P.O. Box denial is not theoretical—it is a documented, observable instance in which Plaintiff’s rights were curtailed in practice. Unlike abstract anomalies, this is a concrete example of constitutional deprivation manifesting in everyday life.

II. NPE status cannot lawfully void contracts or personhood.
 By law, USPS cannot pick and choose whom it serves absent statutory authority. To deny mail delivery based on secret anomaly or NPE classification amounts to an unconstitutional abridgment of civil rights.

III. Denial of mail delivery undermines core constitutional guarantees.
 Mail access underpins fundamental rights: to contract, to receive notice, to engage in commerce, and to participate in civic life. Stripping Plaintiff of this access constitutes functional civil death—a state long recognized as unconstitutional when imposed without due process.

CONCLUSION

The USPS’s refusal to deliver mail to Plaintiff’s P.O. Box, despite accepting Plaintiff’s application and fee, is evidence of systemic fraud, unconstitutional discrimination, and the functional denial of personhood. This conduct supports Plaintiff’s claim that NPE classification is being used as a covert mechanism to strip individuals of their rights while simultaneously exploiting them financially.
