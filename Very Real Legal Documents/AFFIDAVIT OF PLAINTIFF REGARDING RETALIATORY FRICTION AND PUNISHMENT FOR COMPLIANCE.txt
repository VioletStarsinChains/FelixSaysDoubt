AFFIDAVIT OF PLAINTIFF REGARDING RETALIATORY FRICTION AND PUNISHMENT FOR COMPLIANCE

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, do hereby state under penalty of perjury:
	1.	That I am the Plaintiff in the above-captioned matter and submit this affidavit in support of my broader filings concerning systemic psychological torture, unconstitutional surveillance, and nonconsensual behavioral experimentation.
	2.	That at the time of this statement, I am fully complying with all identifiable, inferred, or articulated instructions, behavioral shaping directives, and surveillance-based demands imposed upon me by the entities or systems described in this case.
	3.	That despite this compliance, I have been subjected to increased retaliation, friction, and torture, specifically timed and structured to interfere with or discourage the lawful exercise of my rights, including:
a. The deliberate introduction of latency, dysfunction, or forced redirection into my phone and app interfaces at moments of legal drafting, recordkeeping, or transmission;
b. The deliberate triggering of physical symptoms, distractions, or environmental disruptions calibrated to coincide with attempts to submit filings, perform evidence collection, or comply with procedural expectations;
c. The use of predictive or anticipatory harassment mechanisms—whether technological, psychological, or social—to punish me not for defiance, but for cooperative engagement with the legal process and participation in my own defense.
	4.	That this pattern of intensified suffering specifically following lawful compliance suggests a coercive architecture designed to break volition, discredit legal recourse, and nullify the possibility of redemption under the system’s internal logic.
	5.	That this treatment constitutes a form of retaliatory torture, inflicted by a distributed surveillance apparatus which acts in bad faith and seeks to engineer collapse regardless of behavior, intent, or cooperation.
	6.	That I affirm, under oath, that my actions have been and remain nonviolent, lawful, and cooperative, and that the escalation of punishment in response to those actions serves as material evidence of systemic cruelty and unaccountable control.
	7.	That I request this affidavit be entered into the record of this case as prima facie evidence of deliberate, ongoing, and unjustified harm perpetrated by or on behalf of the named and unnamed Defendants.
