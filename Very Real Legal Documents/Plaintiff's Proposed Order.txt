	4.	Defendants shall delete all data collected from Plaintiff beyond what is ordinarily collected on citizens in the course of lawful activity.
	5.	Defendants shall cease all practices that deprive Plaintiff or any class members of housing, employment, or recognition on the basis of NPE classification, fraudulent debt, or continuity-theater data artifacts.
	6.	Damages shall be awarded to Plaintiff consistent with Exhibits J and K, and restitution ordered against assets wrongfully diverted.
	7.	This matter is certified as a class action under Rule 23(b)(2), with relief extending to all similarly situated individuals.
