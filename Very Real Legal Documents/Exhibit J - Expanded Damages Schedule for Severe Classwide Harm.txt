EXHIBIT J

Expanded Damages Schedule for Severe Classwide Harm

⸻

INTRODUCTION

This Exhibit supplements and expands upon prior damages frameworks (Exhibit I), clarifying that initial valuations were conservative relative to the scale, duration, and severity of harm suffered by Plaintiff and the proposed class. The nature of the injuries at issue—lifelong surveillance, biomedical assault, housing deprivation, coerced labor, psychological torture, and systemic fraud—requires damages commensurate with the gravest categories of civil, constitutional, and human rights violations recognized in law.

ANALYSIS OF DAMAGES

1. Compensatory Damages
Compensatory damages must address:
	•	Lifelong deprivation of housing stability;
	•	Covert biomedical experimentation and induced illness;
	•	Psychological and neurological trauma from constant surveillance and manipulation;
	•	Economic losses from systemic exclusion from employment, credit, and contracts.

Baseline compensatory damages should begin at $10 million per plaintiff, rising to $25 million for those who experienced repeated biomedical interventions, custody events, or targeted deprivation.

2. Punitive Damages
Given the intentional, systemic, and profit-driven nature of the enterprise, punitive damages are not only appropriate but essential. Historical analogues (tobacco, asbestos, opioid litigation) support a punitive multiplier of 5x–10x compensatory damages.

3. Wrongful Death / De Facto Wrongful Death Damages
For anomalies whose lives were shortened, destroyed, or rendered functionally non-human through “non-person entity” classification, wrongful death damages must mirror or exceed 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund standards, beginning at $20 million.

4. Aggregate Class Recovery
	•	Low Estimate: $10 trillion (based on ~1M class members at $10M each).
	•	Moderate Estimate: $15–20 trillion.
	•	High Estimate: $30+ trillion (accounting for punitive multipliers, wrongful death, and generational harms).

⸻

LEGAL AND ETHICAL BASIS
	•	Constitutional Violations: Systematic deprivation of rights under the 4th, 5th, 8th, and 14th Amendments.
	•	International Law: Violations of the Nuremberg Code, Geneva Conventions, and UN Convention Against Torture.
	•	Domestic Analogue: Historic settlements for state-backed abuse (Tuskegee, MKUltra) are instructive but undervalued by modern standards.

The scope here—decades of covert classification, surveillance, and monetization of human lives—requires damages scaled to both compensate victims and deter future misconduct.

⸻

CONCLUSION

The prior schedule underestimated the gravity of harm. Properly calibrated damages for the class begin at $10 million per plaintiff and escalate to $50+ million for the most severe cases, yielding an aggregate recovery of $10–30 trillion.

Such damages are necessary to:
	1.	Restore the dignity and autonomy of anomalies and surveillants;
	2.	Punish Defendants for systemic violations;
	3.	Deter repetition of these practices by any future state or corporate actors.
