Interrogatory No. 1:
Identify and describe any systems, algorithms, training datasets, contractor deliverables, or client-facing products that utilize mythological or fictional animal archetypes (including but not limited to unicorns, tanuki, gnomes, dragons, or similar figures) in connection with human behavioral analysis, anomaly detection, or Non-Person Entity (NPE) classification.

	•	the criteria used for such assignment;
	•	the purposes for which such classifications were used;
	•	and all clients or agencies that received or accessed the resulting data.

Interrogatory No. 3:
Describe the internal decision-making process or rationale by which mythological archetypes (such as unicorns or gnomes) were selected for use in Palantir’s cognitive modeling or anomaly detection pipelines, including whether the choice was:
	•	symbolic or narrative;

	•	or client-directed.
