PLAINTIFF’S [EIGHTH] SET OF INTERROGATORIES AND REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION TO DEFENDANT PALANTIR TECHNOLOGIES INC.

⸻

INTERROGATORIES
	1.	State whether Palantir’s anomaly/NPE classification systems ingested or processed student disciplinary records, behavioral incident reports, or teacher communications originating from Eastside Christian School, 2450 Lower Roswell Rd, Marietta, GA 30068, between 1995–2005.
	2.	State whether Palantir or its government clients maintained agreements, partnerships, or data-sharing arrangements that allowed private schools (including religious schools) to transmit student behavioral or disciplinary data into federal or contractor databases.
	3.	State whether Palantir or its government clients tracked or analyzed incidents of forced or compelled speech (including speech produced under implant manipulation, duress, or altered states) as inputs for anomaly/NPE classification.
	4.	Identify all Palantir employees, contractors, or affiliates responsible for determining how school-based records or speech-related incidents would be weighted in anomaly/NPE classification.
	5.	State whether Palantir or its government clients conducted any reviews, audits, or analyses to distinguish between voluntary student speech and coerced/implant-influenced speech when using educational records in anomaly/NPE classification.

⸻

REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION
	1.	Produce all contracts, agreements, or memoranda of understanding between Palantir (or its affiliates) and any entity that provided student data from Eastside Christian School or other private schools to anomaly/NPE systems.
	2.	Produce all technical specifications, ingestion schemas, or data dictionaries describing how school disciplinary or behavioral data were incorporated into anomaly/NPE classification.
	3.	Produce all internal testing reports, audits, or analyses addressing the risk that coerced speech or implant-influenced statements could be misclassified as voluntary behavior in anomaly/NPE modeling.
	4.	Produce all communications with government clients discussing the use of school-based records — including disciplinary incidents or behavioral flags — as anomaly/NPE indicators.
	5.	Produce all legal, compliance, or ethics reviews concerning the use of student speech or school records in anomaly/NPE classification, particularly in contexts where forced or manipulated speech was possible.
