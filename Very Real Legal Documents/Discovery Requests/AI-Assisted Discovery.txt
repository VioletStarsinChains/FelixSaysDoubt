IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

KELLYN CLAY,

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, et al.,
  Defendants.

PLAINTIFF’S PROPOSED PROTOCOL FOR AI-ASSISTED DISCOVERY

I. Purpose

The purpose of this protocol is to establish clear parameters for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) agents in discovery. Plaintiff Kellyn Clay faces unique barriers to receiving records directly (including mail restrictions and systemic obstruction). To ensure fair process, AI indexing tools must be permitted to locate, structure, and cross-reference responsive records on Plaintiff’s behalf.

⸻

II. Scope

This protocol applies to all records sought in discovery, including but not limited to:
	•	International travel records (airline manifests, ticketing, CBP entry/exit logs).
	•	Medical records (hospital EMRs, school nurse logs, experimental protocol notes).
	•	Educational and institutional records (field trip rosters, school contracts, USDA/NIH/DARPA grants).
	•	Communications between Defendants and third parties (contractors, vendors, or foreign authorities).

⸻

III. Function of AI Agents

AI agents shall be authorized to:
	1.	Ingest bulk datasets produced by Defendants (including manifests, logs, communications).
	2.	Extract relevant entries tied to Plaintiff’s identifiers (name, DOB, school enrollment, passport numbers, addresses).
	3.	Cross-reference across disparate datasets to identify anomalies (e.g., ticketing irregularities, selective exclusions, incident reports).
	4.	Generate structured outputs (e.g., tables, JSON logs, timelines) that can be filed under seal with the Court.

AI agents shall not create or infer facts beyond the records provided. Their role is limited to indexing, cross-referencing, and structuring evidence already in Defendants’ possession.

⸻

IV. Access and Safeguards
	•	AI outputs shall be produced simultaneously to Plaintiff and Defendants, ensuring parity of access.
	•	Sensitive outputs (containing minors’ names, PII, or sealed information) shall be submitted under seal or for in camera review by the Court.
	•	Defendants may challenge AI outputs on grounds of accuracy or overbreadth, but may not obstruct AI indexing of bulk records once produced.

⸻

V. Rationale
	1.	Efficiency: Many responsive records span decades and multiple agencies. Manual review would be unreasonably burdensome and risk omission of key materials.
	2.	Fairness: Plaintiff is uniquely disadvantaged by barriers to direct record access (e.g., mail restrictions). AI indexing ensures she is not denied meaningful discovery.
	3.	Neutrality: AI agents are not partisan tools; they operate under transparent instructions and produce structured evidence for the Court’s use.
	4.	Accountability: This protocol ensures all outputs are visible to both parties and the Court, preventing ex parte use or hidden manipulation.

⸻

VI. Requested Relief

Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court issue an order:
	•	Authorizing the use of AI indexing tools in discovery.
	•	Directing Defendants to provide bulk datasets (travel, medical, educational, contractual) in machine-readable formats.
	•	Requiring that AI outputs be shared with both parties and, where necessary, filed under seal.
	•	Confirming that AI indexing is a legitimate and necessary method of discovery under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 26 and 34.

Respectfully submitted,

Kellyn Clay
Plaintiff, Pro Se

To the Honorable Judge:

I am submitting the enclosed Proposed Protocol for AI-Assisted Discovery. I respectfully ask the Court to consider authorizing this approach for the following reasons:
	1.	Unique Barriers to Access
I face systemic barriers that prevent me from reliably receiving records directly (including mail restrictions and obstruction). Without an alternative, I will be effectively denied access to my own discovery.
	2.	Volume and Complexity of Records
The records relevant to this case span decades and involve multiple agencies, institutions, and contractors. Even if I were able to receive them directly, the sheer volume would make manual review impractical.
	3.	AI as a Neutral Indexing Tool
The AI agents I propose are not being used to generate or speculate about facts. They function only to:

	•	Ingest bulk datasets produced by Defendants,
	•	Search for my identifiers (name, DOB, school enrollment, travel data),
	•	Cross-reference across sources, and
	•	Output structured lists, timelines, and summaries.

This is the same indexing and cross-referencing work that a large legal team would normally perform. The AI simply allows a pro se plaintiff like myself to participate in discovery on a fair footing.
	4.	Transparency and Safeguards
All AI outputs would be shared simultaneously with Defendants and, when necessary, filed under seal with the Court. This ensures transparency, prevents ex parte use, and protects sensitive information such as minors’ names or medical details.
	5.	Fairness
Without this protocol, I risk being buried under inaccessible or unusable records, which would deny me meaningful discovery. Allowing AI indexing ensures both sides and the Court have the same access to structured, usable evidence.

⸻

Request
For these reasons, I respectfully request that the Court adopt the Proposed Protocol for AI-Assisted Discovery, authorize Defendants to produce machine-readable datasets, and allow AI indexing to proceed under the safeguards described.
