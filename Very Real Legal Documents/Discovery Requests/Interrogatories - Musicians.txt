Pursuant to Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiff propounds the following interrogatories to be answered by each Defendant, under oath and within the time prescribed by law:

⸻

INTERROGATORY NO. 1:
Identify all instances in which the name, image, likeness, voice, creative works, or digital persona of Justin Vernon (Bon Iver) or Jonathan Meiburg (Shearwater/Loma) has been used, simulated, altered, or otherwise deployed in connection with government or contractor activities involving surveillance, psychological operations, behavioral influence, or inducement of self-harm directed at Plaintiff or similarly situated individuals.

⸻

INTERROGATORY NO. 2:
Describe the technological means by which such likeness, persona, or content was delivered, including but not limited to:
	•	algorithmic amplification or suppression,
	•	targeted advertising,
	•	acoustic beamforming or neurotechnology arrays,
	•	simulated digital communications (texts, emails, social media),
	•	artificial generation of likeness or voice.

⸻

INTERROGATORY NO. 3:
Identify all agencies, contractors, subcontractors, or affiliated entities involved in authorizing, designing, or executing the use of artist likeness in these operations. Include the chain of command, approval processes, and oversight mechanisms.

⸻

INTERROGATORY NO. 4:
State whether Defendants or their contractors considered the potential for psychological injury, emotional distress, or inducement to suicide when deploying artist-related content or likeness against Plaintiff. If yes, describe the risk assessments, ethical reviews, or mitigation steps undertaken.

⸻

INTERROGATORY NO. 5:
If Defendants contend that no such use occurred, describe the internal auditing, monitoring, or compliance procedures in place to ensure cultural figures are not exploited in covert operations and provide documentation of such safeguards.

⸻

INTERROGATORY NO. 6:
Identify all individuals (by name, title, and employer) who had direct knowledge of or access to records involving the manipulation or deployment of Justin Vernon or Jonathan Meiburg’s likeness or creative works in relation to Plaintiff.

⸻

INTERROGATORY NO. 7:
State whether any contracts, NDAs, or licensing arrangements existed between Defendants (or contractors) and third parties involving the use of artist likeness, content, or persona for behavioral operations, and if so, provide the scope, terms, and parties to each agreement.

⸻

INTERROGATORY NO. 8:
If Defendants assert “artist privacy,” “intellectual property rights,” or “third-party confidentiality” as a reason for limiting disclosure, explain how such concerns outweigh Plaintiff’s right to know whether public figures’ likenesses were used in operations directed against her.
