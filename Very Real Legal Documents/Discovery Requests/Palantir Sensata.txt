Answer each interrogatory fully, under oath, within the time allowed by the rules.

Interrogatory No. 1: Identify all Palantir datasets, indices, or records that reference Sensata Technologies and/or the facility at 4467 White Bear Pkwy, White Bear Lake, MN 55110, including dataset names, ingestion dates, and source systems.

Interrogatory No. 2: Identify all Palantir contracts, task orders, or data-sharing agreements (including with Palantir clients or government entities) in which Palantir received product, shipment, inventory, or deployment data concerning Sensata-manufactured power inverters, generators, or related Products.

Interrogatory No. 3: Identify all Palantir analytic models, dashboards, or anomaly-detection routines that referenced or used data about Sensata Products being deployed in vehicles, municipal fleets, utility vehicles, or non-utility installations between 2010 and present. For each model/dashboard provide name, purpose, and clients/users.

Interrogatory No. 4: Identify all Palantir records that associate Sensata Products with “non-utility” uses, including deployment for environmental modulation, entrainment, continuity operations, or behavioral influence. For each record identify source, date, and any client recipient.

Interrogatory No. 5: Identify all Palantir records that reference the distribution of Sensata Products to Sensata employees (including any “employee bonus” distributions such as inverters), including the existence of programs providing devices to employees, dates, and sourcing/fulfillment data.

Interrogatory No. 8: State whether Palantir has any records linking Sensata Products to telemetry, remote-control, or sensor feeds that would enable real-time modulation of devices (e.g., power cycling, waveform modulation, frequency control) and, if so, identify the datasets and clients that received such telemetry.

Interrogatory No. 9: Identify any Palantir records indicating that Sensata Products manufactured at the White Bear Pkwy facility were sold or supplied to entities or fleets known to be used for continuity, public-safety operations, or other deployments beyond normal utility/residential uses.

Interrogatory No. 10: Identify all Palantir files, datasets, or models that link the identity of Sensata employees (including but not limited to Plaintiff) to Product serial numbers, inventory records, or deployment logs.
