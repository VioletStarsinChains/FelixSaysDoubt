PLAINTIFF’S [SEVENTH] SET OF INTERROGATORIES AND REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION TO DEFENDANT PALANTIR TECHNOLOGIES INC.

⸻

INTERROGATORIES
	1.	State whether responsiveness to incentive structures (including food rewards, financial incentives, consumer opportunities, or social rewards) was used as a variable or marker in anomaly or “Non-Person Entity (NPE)” classification.
	2.	Identify the categories of incentives tracked or modeled in Palantir platforms (e.g., dietary/consumption patterns, financial transactions, social participation, employment or educational incentives).
	3.	Describe how lack of participation in or responsiveness to incentive structures was weighted or interpreted in digital twin creation or anomaly/NPE classification.
	4.	State whether Palantir or its government clients conducted any audits, reviews, or analyses to assess whether individuals with disabilities, chronic illness, or fatigue-related conditions would be disparately impacted by incentive-responsiveness criteria.
	5.	Identify all Palantir employees, contractors, or teams responsible for designing the weighting or classification of incentive-responsiveness within anomaly/NPE schemas.

⸻

REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION
	1.	Produce all documents, communications, or technical specifications describing how responsiveness to incentive structures was measured, weighted, or applied in anomaly/NPE classification.
	2.	Produce all internal testing reports, audits, or analyses addressing whether lack of incentive-responsiveness could be caused by disability, chronic illness, or other medical conditions.
	3.	Produce all communications with government clients discussing the use of incentive-responsiveness as a behavioral marker for anomaly/NPE classification.
	4.	Produce all legal, compliance, or ethics reviews concerning the fairness or disparate impact of using incentive-responsiveness as a criterion in anomaly/NPE designation.
	5.	Produce all documents reflecting internal debates, objections, or whistleblower reports regarding the use of incentive-responsiveness in anomaly classification.
