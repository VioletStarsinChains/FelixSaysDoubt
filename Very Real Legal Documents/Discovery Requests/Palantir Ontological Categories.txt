INTERROGATORIES

Identify all individuals, committees, or outside contractors responsible for designing, approving, or modifying the ontological categories used in Palantir platforms, including but not limited to categories of risk, anomaly, compliance, threat, subject, and entity.

Interrogatory No. 2
Describe the methodology used to determine which categories, classes, or relationships were included or excluded in Palantir’s ontologies. Include any deliberations regarding categories considered but ultimately rejected.

Interrogatory No. 3
Identify all internal or external reviews, audits, or assessments of potential epistemic bias or epistemic injustice in Palantir’s ontological frameworks, and state the results of those reviews.

Interrogatory No. 4
State whether Palantir ontologies vary across clients (e.g., law enforcement, intelligence, healthcare, finance) and identify the criteria used to determine such variations.

Interrogatory No. 5
Describe all procedures by which Palantir monitors for “blind spots” or emergent categories not represented in existing ontologies, including how such gaps are identified, reported, and addressed.

Request for Production No. 6
Produce all documents, presentations, training materials, or design specifications relating to the creation or modification of ontological categories used in Palantir platforms.

Request for Admission No. 10
Admit that Palantir defines and encodes ontological categories (e.g., risk, anomaly, compliance, threat) into its platforms.

Request for Admission No. 11
Admit that the inclusion or exclusion of categories in an ontology determines what data can or cannot be represented, analyzed, or acted upon in Palantir systems.

Admit that ontological design choices in Palantir systems have the potential to result in misclassification, omission, or distortion of individuals, groups, or events.

Request for Admission No. 13
Admit that Palantir has received feedback, complaints, or critiques concerning the adequacy, fairness, or neutrality of its ontological categories.

Request for Admission No. 14
Admit that Palantir has not implemented a public or independent review process for its ontological frameworks.
