For each program identify program name, purpose, dates, project leads, and participating stores.

Interrogatory No. 2: Identify all Starbucks personnel, contractors, or third-party vendors who executed, managed, or had operational access to systems or datasets that could be used to correlate purchase events with social-media identifiers (examples: CRM teams, mobile-app analytics, loyalty program teams, Wi-Fi analytics, CCTV ops, POS/data integrations). For each person provide name, title, role, and custodial systems accessed.

Interrogatory No. 4: Describe all technical or procedural methods Starbucks has used to correlate customers’ social-media handles, posts, or profile data with beverage purchase events (e.g., matching loyalty emails to social-media accounts, device MAC address matching, Wi-Fi probe-request correlation, point-of-sale text/phone lookups, geotag/time correlation, social-listening enrichment). For each method identify the vendors, software, or libraries used, the dates used, and sample code or algorithms where not privileged.

Interrogatory No. 5: State whether Starbucks has ever searched for, collected, or stored any social-media identifiers or specific user handles (including @dysautonomian) and linked them to purchase records, loyalty accounts, mobile-app identifiers, Wi-Fi logs, or CCTV timestamps.

Interrogatory No. 6: Identify all agreements, contracts, statements of work, or data-sharing arrangements between Starbucks and any third-party analytics vendors (including Palantir, CRM/data brokers, social-listening vendors) that permitted the vendor to receive or analyze Starbucks data that could be used to correlate beverage purchases with social-media activity.

Interrogatory No. 8: State whether Starbucks has any policy, written guideline, training, or legal review (internal or external) concerning the ethical limits, privacy risks, or legal compliance for correlating purchase activity with social-media identifiers. If so, produce the policies and identify the custodians who maintain them.
