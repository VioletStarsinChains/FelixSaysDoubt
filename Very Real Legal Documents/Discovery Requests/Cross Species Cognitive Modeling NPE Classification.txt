PLAINTIFF’S FIRST REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION

To: United States of America, by and through its agencies including but not limited to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Department of Defense (DoD), Department of Justice (DOJ), and contractors such as Palantir Technologies Inc.

Request No. 1:
Produce any and all documents, communications, research proposals, technical manuals, or contractor deliverables referencing “theriomorphological modeling,” “cross-species cognitive modeling,” “parapolitical classification,” or “animal proxies” used in connection with human behavioral analysis, anomaly detection, or predictive modeling.

Request No. 2:
Produce any records, guidelines, or training materials defining or explaining the use of animal-based cognitive baselines for the classification of humans as “Non-Person Entities” (NPEs), “anomalies,” or “out-of-distribution subjects.”

Request No. 3:
Produce any risk assessments, policy memoranda, or oversight reports regarding the use of cross-species behavioral analogues in human experimentation, surveillance, or classification systems.

Request No. 4:
Produce any contractor invoices, deliverables, or internal communications referencing “enchiridion” or “handbook”-style manuals related to animal cognition as applied to human anomaly modeling.

Request No. 5:
Produce any communications between the United States and Palantir Technologies Inc., or any other private contractor, discussing the integration of cross-species datasets into anomaly detection or behavioral futures markets.

Request No. 6:
Produce any documents, datasets, model specifications, validation studies, or update protocols that reference or reflect the progressive narrowing of “typical” behavioral baselines in anomaly or NPE classification systems, including but not limited to:
	•	records of successive model updates showing changes in what qualifies as “typical”;
	•	documents explaining or justifying the exclusion of previously included individuals or groups;
	•	internal analyses of feedback loops, circular reasoning, or self-reinforcing exclusion in predictive modeling;
	•	oversight reports, audits, or contractor communications acknowledging that such narrowing increases the likelihood of additional humans being classified as anomalies or NPEs.

Respectfully submitted,
Kellyn Clay, Plaintiff, pro se
