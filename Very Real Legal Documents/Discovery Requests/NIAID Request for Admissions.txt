PLAINTIFF’S FIRST REQUESTS FOR ADMISSIONS TO DEFENDANT NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES (NIAID)

TO: Defendant National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), by and through its counsel of record.

FROM: Plaintiff, Kellyn Clay.

Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 36, Plaintiff requests that Defendant admit or deny the following statements within thirty (30) days of service:
	1.	Admit that NIAID has been aware since at least the 1980s that silicone breast implants are associated with systemic immune dysfunction, mast cell activation, and autoimmune-like syndromes.
	2.	Admit that systemic implantation of foreign materials (including silicone, metals, polymers, and nanoscale sensors) can provoke chronic immune activation.
	3.	Admit that mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) can be triggered by exposure to implanted biomedical devices.
	4.	Admit that placement of implants in or near major organs or nerve centers poses an increased risk of systemic immune dysregulation.
	5.	Admit that NIAID has funded or been aware of research exploring the use of implants to monitor immune function or allergic response.
	6.	Admit that NIAID has received reports of adverse immune reactions caused by biomedical implants other than breast implants.
	7.	Admit that NIAID has collaborated with other federal agencies (including DoD, DARPA, HHS, or CDC) in projects involving implants or nanosensors for data collection on human immune function.
	8.	Admit that NIAID has shared data or research findings with private contractors (including Palantir, Deloitte, Accenture, Booz Allen, or Oura Health) regarding implant-based monitoring of immune or allergic conditions.
	9.	Admit that implant-derived data has been discussed or applied in contexts involving predictive modeling, digital twin construction, or behavioral futures markets.
	10.	Admit that widespread implantation across multiple organ systems could foreseeably cause MCAS, idiopathic anaphylaxis, or histamine intolerance.

Respectfully submitted,
Kellyn Clay, Plaintiff, pro se
