Rule 34 Request for Inspection

PLAINTIFF’S FIRST REQUEST FOR INSPECTION TO DEFENDANTS

Pursuant to Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiff Kellyn Clay hereby requests that Defendants permit the inspection, testing, and analysis of the following tangible item in Plaintiff’s possession:
	1.	Stuffed Animal Obtained During Employment-Related Activity
	•	The item is a stuffed animal acquired by Plaintiff while working in Minnesota in door-to-door employment where routes were chosen by the employer and movements were tracked through a location-based application. On one such route, Plaintiff encountered a stuffed animal placed on a porch with a sign indicating it was free and brought the item into their possession.
	•	From the first time Plaintiff handled it, the object has been associated with episodes of tachycardia (abnormally rapid heart rate), which recur whenever Plaintiff comes into contact with it.
	•	Plaintiff seeks inspection to determine whether the object contains hidden electronics, transmitters, chemical agents, or other devices traceable to Defendants or their affiliates.

Scope of Inspection:
	•	Non-destructive forensic imaging and scanning (X-ray, RF spectrum analysis, chemical swab tests).
	•	Chain-of-custody documentation for all testing procedures.
	•	Production of all inspection results, reports, and expert findings to Plaintiff.

Respectfully submitted,
Kellyn Clay, Plaintiff, pro se
