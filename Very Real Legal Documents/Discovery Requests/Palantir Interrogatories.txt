INTERROGATORIES
	1.	Identify all officers, directors, or employees of Palantir who, at any time from 2008 to present, were responsible for the design, testing, or oversight of anomaly-classification schemas, including but not limited to designations of “Non-Person Entity” (NPE).
	2.

	3.	Identify the individuals or teams responsible for ontology design and data-modeling decisions regarding anomaly classification.
	4.	State whether any internal testing or evaluation revealed false positives or context-stripped anomaly labels, and if so, identify the employees or contractors who reviewed or approved the continued deployment of those systems.
	5.	Identify all program managers or liaisons between Palantir and U.S. government agencies (CIA, DoD, DOJ, or other contracting entities) who were aware of anomaly or NPE designations being provided as outputs.
	6.	Describe the role of Palantir’s legal, compliance, or risk management personnel in reviewing anomaly classification practices, and identify any officers or employees who provided written or oral guidance on civil rights, due process, or benefit-access implications.
	7.	Identify any Palantir employees or executives who raised concerns regarding anomaly/NPE classification practices, and describe how those concerns were addressed or dismissed.

REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION
	1.	Produce all documents, communications, or presentations reflecting internal knowledge that externally induced transient states (e.g., chemical exposures, environmental triggers, narrative overlays) were being logged as permanent anomaly traits.

	3.	Produce all internal testing reports, error analyses, or quality-control documents referencing false positives, misclassifications, or context-stripped labels.
	4.	Produce all communications with government clients in which Palantir personnel explained, qualified, or concealed the nature of anomaly/NPE classifications.
	5.	Produce all internal or external legal, compliance, or ethics reviews concerning anomaly classifications, NPE labels, or deprivation of access to Social Security or other benefits.
