Certification
These requests are made in good faith, within the scope of Rule 26, and are directly relevant to Plaintiff’s claim that the Mayfield + Lost Sea field trip (1999–2001) constituted a structured exposure of minors to environments of nutritional entrainment and autonomic stress testing. Plaintiff experienced autonomic collapse during the trip, while peer Ashley Wilson was selectively excluded for “medical reasons,” indicating foreknowledge of risk and deliberate selection criteria.
