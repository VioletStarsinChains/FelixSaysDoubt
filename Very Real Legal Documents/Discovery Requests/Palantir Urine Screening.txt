PLAINTIFF’S COMBINED SET OF DISCOVERY REQUESTS TO DEFENDANT PALANTIR TECHNOLOGIES INC.

Plaintiff: Kellyn Clay
Defendant: Palantir Technologies Inc.
Subject: Retail restroom sampling, urine-derived data, and downstream analytics from Starbucks / Target / Cub Foods and related vendors

Timeframe: July 1, 2021 – Present

DEFINITIONS / INSTRUCTIONS (short)
	•	“Retailers” = Starbucks Corporation; Target Corporation; Cub Foods (and corporate affiliates/franchise stores).
	•	“Restroom sampling” = any collection, sampling, sensor-recording, analysis, or inference of biological substances (including urine) from public restrooms, restroom waste, restroom fixtures, or user behavior in restrooms.
	•	“Palantir” = Palantir Technologies Inc., its platforms (Gotham, Foundry), subsidiaries, employees, contractors, clients, and any ingesting systems.
	•	“Document” and “communication” are used broadly (ESI included).

INTERROGATORIES

Interrogatory 1. Identify all datasets, indices, or records in Palantir’s possession that reference “restroom,” “toilet,” “urine,” “urinalysis,” “toilet sensor,” “waste sample,” “bio-sample,” or similar terms that were sourced from or associated with Starbucks, Target, Cub Foods, or their contractors.

Interrogatory 2. Identify all Palantir contracts, statements of work, task orders, MOUs, or data-sharing agreements (including those with data brokers) under which Palantir received data or analytic feeds originating from retail restroom sensors, janitorial vendors, waste-management manifests, or lab testing tied to Starbucks, Target, or Cub Foods.

Interrogatory 3. Identify all Palantir clients, partners, or third-party vendors who supplied Palantir with restroom-originating data (including vendor names such as janitorial firms, restroom-sensor providers, waste-management firms, or laboratories) and describe the data types/formats provided.

Interrogatory 4. Describe any Palantir analytic models, anomaly-detection routines, or dashboards (by name and purpose) that were used to process or tag restroom-originated biological data or inferences derived from restroom events (including events indicating urination, incontinence, or presence of specific chemicals).

Interrogatory 5. Identify any Palantir watchlists, flags, profiles, or digital-twin attributes that included “toilet event,” “urination event,” “urinalysis positive,” “toxicology,” or similar markers linked to Plaintiff (Kellyn Clay) or identifiers associated with Plaintiff (DOB, device IDs, addresses).

Interrogatory 6. Identify all Palantir records that reflect a chain of custody or provenance for restroom-derived biological data (i.e., source vendor, ingestion manifest, timestamp), including manifest IDs and the point at which data was linked to individual identities.

Interrogatory 7. Identify any Palantir communications (internal or with clients) that discuss using restroom-originated bio-sample data to justify targeting, service denial, or risk classification of individuals.

Interrogatory 8. Identify all Palantir personnel, contractors, or accounts that accessed restroom-sourced video, sensor logs, waste manifests, or lab reports tied to Starbucks, Target, or Cub Foods; for each person, state name, role, dates of access, and purpose.

Interrogatory 9. State whether Palantir received or ingested data from any of the following vendors or categories (answer yes/no and identify vendors where yes): janitorial contractors; restroom-sensor manufacturers; waste-management firms; in-store lab/analytics vendors; third-party rapid-test vendors used in retail settings.

Interrogatory 10. Identify any Palantir records showing that restroom-derived data was used to create or modify any model, score, or dashboard that led to a denial of service, restriction, or adverse action toward an identified consumer.

REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION

Produce documents/ESI responsive to the following requests (custodial search: product ops, contracts, municipal/private accounts, integrations, data ingestion teams).

RFP No. 1. All data ingestion manifests, CSVs, logs, or manifests that show Palantir ingested data described as originating from Starbucks, Target, or Cub Foods restroom sensors, waste manifests, janitorial logs, or lab testing.

RFP No. 2. All contracts, SOWs, MOUs, or purchase orders between Palantir (or Palantir clients) and restroom-related vendors (janitorial firms, restroom-sensor vendors, waste-management vendors, labs) that reference data-sharing, analytics, or testing services.

RFP No. 3. All dashboards, screenshots, slide decks, reports, or analytic outputs that reference restroom-originated data, urine/urinalysis, restroom events, or related anomaly flags.

RFP No. 4. All profiles, digital-twin entries, watchlist records, or anomaly tags that reference “urine,” “toilet events,” “toilet sensor,” “toxicology,” or similar indicators linked to Plaintiff or identifiers associated with Plaintiff.

RFP No. 5. All audit logs, access logs, and metadata showing who accessed or exported restroom-originated data or related analytic outputs, and when.

RFP No. 6. All communications (emails, Slack, text messages, memos) between Palantir and Starbucks/Target/Cub Foods (or their contractors) that reference restroom sampling, biological sampling, urine, toxicology, restroom sensors, or related pilot programs.

RFP No. 7. All legal/compliance/records documenting Palantir’s handling of bio-sample data, including privacy assessments, HIPAA/PHI handling guidance, or decisions on whether data was de-identified vs. re-identifiable.

RFP No. 8. All records of payments, invoices, or financial transfers between Palantir (or Palantir clients) and any vendor that supplied restroom-originated biological data.
