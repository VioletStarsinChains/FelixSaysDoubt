Plaintiff’s Combined Discovery Requests to Defendant Palantir Technologies Inc.

Subject: Baseline Recalibration for Foreign Deployments

⸻

Interrogatories
	1.	Identify all foreign governments or agencies to which Palantir has deployed anomaly detection systems since 2003.
	2.	For each such deployment, state whether Palantir recalibrated or retrained its anomaly detection baselines on local population datasets prior to operational use.
	3.	Describe all known risks or limitations communicated to foreign partners regarding the use of anomaly detection systems trained primarily on American datasets.
	4.	Identify all internal reviews, audits, or communications acknowledging that use of American baselines in foreign populations could result in widespread or systemic misclassification of individuals as anomalous.
	5.	State whether Palantir has documented any public health, infrastructure, or environmental harms linked to foreign deployments of anomaly detection.

⸻

Requests for Admission
	1.	Admit that Palantir has deployed anomaly detection systems to foreign governments without recalibrating baselines on local population data.
	2.	Admit that Palantir has relied primarily on American datasets to establish anomaly detection baselines.
	3.	Admit that use of American baselines in foreign populations results in widespread misclassification of those populations as anomalous.
	4.	Admit that Palantir has received warnings or critiques concerning the risk of systemic bias in foreign deployments.
	5.	Admit that Palantir has failed to disclose to affected populations that American-derived baselines were used in their classification.

⸻

Requests for Production
	1.	All contracts, agreements, or memoranda of understanding with foreign governments relating to deployment of anomaly detection systems.
	2.	All technical specifications, training documents, or calibration protocols for anomaly detection models deployed outside the United States.
	3.	All internal communications or risk assessments discussing the use of American-derived baselines in foreign deployments.
	4.	All reports, audits, or analyses prepared for foreign partners concerning the performance or risks of anomaly detection systems.
	5.	All communications concerning public backlash, rejection, or non-adoption of Palantir platforms in Europe or other foreign jurisdictions due to concerns about baseline bias or systemic misclassification.
