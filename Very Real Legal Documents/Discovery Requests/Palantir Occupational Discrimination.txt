PLAINTIFF’S THIRD COMBINED DISCOVERY REQUESTS TO DEFENDANT PALANTIR TECHNOLOGIES INC. AND SUBCONTRACTORS

Interrogatories
	1.	State whether Palantir’s anomaly or NPE classification systems incorporated consumer purchase history, media consumption, or hobby/interest shifts as classification criteria.
	2.	Identify whether occupational factors — including exposure to abnormally high volumes of information (e.g., professional closed captioning) — were analyzed or flagged as anomalous behaviors.
	3.	State whether Palantir or its government clients ever assessed the risk of occupational bias in anomaly classification, particularly where employment itself requires atypical information exposure or consumer patterns.
	4.	Identify whether Palantir Technologies Inc., or any of its subcontractors or affiliates, entered into a data-sharing agreement, partnership, or contract with Rev.com, Inc. or its affiliates, at any time from 2008 to present.
	5.	If such an agreement existed, describe in detail:
a. The scope of data shared (e.g., transcripts, captions, metadata, worker performance data, consumer purchase or interest data).
b. The purposes for which the data were used.
c. The Palantir platforms (e.g., Gotham, Foundry, Apollo) that ingested or processed such data.
d. Whether data from captioners or transcriptionists (including Plaintiff) were analyzed or modeled.
	6.	Identify all Palantir employees, contractors, or program managers who negotiated, executed, or oversaw any data-sharing agreement with Rev.com.
	7.	State whether anomaly or NPE classification schemas incorporated data originating from Rev.com, including worker behavioral data, occupational performance patterns, or transcript-derived metadata.
	8.	State whether Palantir or its government clients evaluated the risk that data from Rev.com could introduce occupational bias into anomaly/NPE classification, particularly affecting closed captioners or transcriptionists.

Requests for Production
	1.	Produce all documents, models, or schemas referencing purchase history, interest changes, or hobby shifts as indicators of anomaly/NPE status.
	2.	Produce any audits, testing reports, or analyses addressing the disparate impact of anomaly classification on individuals in occupations involving unusually high information exposure (e.g., captioners, journalists, researchers).
	3.	Produce all communications with government clients regarding the use of consumer purchase history, media consumption, or hobby shifts in anomaly/NPE classification.
  4.	Produce all agreements, contracts, memoranda of understanding, or data-sharing agreements between Palantir Technologies Inc. (or its affiliates) and Rev.com, Inc.
	5.	Produce all internal or external communications discussing the scope, purpose, or implementation of data-sharing between Palantir and Rev.com.
	6.	Produce all technical specifications, data dictionaries, or ingestion schemas describing how Rev.com data were incorporated into Palantir platforms.
	7.	Produce all testing reports, audits, or analyses addressing the use of Rev.com data in anomaly/NPE classification or other predictive modeling.
	8.	Produce all communications with government clients referencing Rev.com data, including explanations of how such data were used in anomaly/NPE outputs.
