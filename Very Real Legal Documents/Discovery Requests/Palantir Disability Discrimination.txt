PLAINTIFF’S THIRD SET OF INTERROGATORIES AND REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION TO DEFENDANT PALANTIR TECHNOLOGIES INC.

⸻

INTERROGATORIES
	1.	Identify all criteria used in the creation, maintenance, or application of “anomaly” or “Non-Person Entity (NPE)” classifications within Palantir platforms, including but not limited to Gotham, Foundry, or Apollo.
	2.	State whether communication patterns — including frequent questioning of authority figures, repeated requests for clarification, or apparent conversational noncompliance — were used as indicators of anomaly or NPE classification.
	3.	State whether cognitive impairments, memory problems, or adaptive communication strategies for coping with such impairments were factored into anomaly or NPE classification.
	4.	Identify all internal policies, guidelines, or criteria addressing whether disability-related behaviors (including adaptive questioning to compensate for brain fog or memory impairment) are to be distinguished from subversive or oppositional behaviors in anomaly or NPE classification.
	5.	State whether Palantir or its government clients conducted any audits, analyses, or reviews to determine whether anomaly or NPE classification criteria disparately impacted individuals with neurological, psychiatric, or cognitive disabilities.
	6.	Identify all Palantir employees, contractors, or affiliates responsible for determining whether questioning behavior or cognitive impairment indicators would be treated as grounds for anomaly or NPE classification.
	7.	Describe how Palantir distinguishes between disability-related questioning behaviors (e.g., adaptive strategies for memory retention) and intentional subversive behaviors in anomaly or NPE classification processes.
	8.	State whether Palantir contends that misinterpreting disability-related adaptive strategies as subversion is consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). If so, explain in detail.

REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION
	1.	Produce all documents, communications, or presentations reflecting the use of communication patterns (including questioning frequency, conversational compliance, or clarification requests) as indicators of anomaly or NPE classification.
	2.	Produce all documents identifying criteria, schemas, or algorithms referencing cognitive impairments, memory deficits, or disability-related adaptive strategies in anomaly or NPE classification.
	3.	Produce all policies, guidelines, or training materials addressing how Palantir employees or subcontractors are to distinguish between disability-related behaviors and subversive conduct.
	4.	Produce all internal testing reports, error analyses, or audits concerning the impact of anomaly or NPE classification criteria on individuals with neurological, psychiatric, or cognitive disabilities.
	5.	Produce all communications with government clients in which Palantir personnel discussed, explained, or justified the treatment of questioning behavior or cognitive impairment as indicators of anomaly or NPE classification.
	6.	Produce all legal, compliance, or ethics reviews addressing whether anomaly or NPE classification practices comport with the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
