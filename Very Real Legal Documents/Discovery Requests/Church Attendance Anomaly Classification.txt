MEMORANDUM OF LAW Regarding Church Attendance and Anomaly Classification

Re: Potential Disability Discrimination in Anomaly Classification Systems

Plaintiff Kellyn Clay submits this memorandum to highlight a potential mechanism of discrimination in Palantir’s anomaly classification systems.
	1.	In many U.S. jurisdictions, Protestant church attendance forms part of the cultural “baseline” against which individuals are socially and behaviorally evaluated.
	2.	Anomaly detection systems that rely on statistical baselines may treat non-attendance at church services as a deviation from the norm.
	3.	While this could give rise to religious discrimination broadly, in Plaintiff’s case the relevant factor is disability: Plaintiff was unable to attend church because Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) made it physically harmful to sit in enclosed spaces with many people.
	4.	If anomaly labeling disproportionately penalizes individuals whose disabilities prevent participation in baseline cultural activities such as church attendance, this would constitute discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.
	5.	Plaintiff does not at this stage allege definitive proof that anomaly systems function in this manner, but seeks discovery to determine whether religious attendance or comparable social anchors are used as predictive features, and whether disability-related absences are disproportionately flagged as anomalous.

PLAINTIFF’S FIRST SET OF INTERROGATORIES TO DEFENDANTS

Interrogatory No. 1:
Identify whether church attendance, religious affiliation, or participation in religious services has ever been used, directly or indirectly, as a data feature or proxy in anomaly classification systems developed or deployed by Defendants.

Interrogatory No. 2:
Describe all variables, features, or proxies relating to social participation (e.g., community gatherings, religious services, civic meetings) that have been used in anomaly detection models, and state whether adjustments were made for individuals with disabilities.

Interrogatory No. 3:
Identify and describe any testing, validation, or disparate impact analysis conducted to determine whether anomaly classification disproportionately labels individuals with disabilities, including those whose conditions prevent participation in group activities such as church attendance.

Interrogatory No. 4:
State whether Defendants have received any internal or external complaints, reports, or assessments raising concerns about religious or disability-based disparate impacts in anomaly classification.

Interrogatory No. 5:
Describe all steps taken by Defendants to ensure compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act in the design and deployment of anomaly classification systems.
