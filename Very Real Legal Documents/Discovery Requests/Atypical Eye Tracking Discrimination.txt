PLAINTIFF’S FIRST SET OF INTERROGATORIES TO DEFENDANTS

Interrogatory No. 6:
Identify whether eye tracking, gaze direction, blink rate, saccade patterns, or pupil response have ever been used, directly or indirectly, as features in anomaly classification systems developed or deployed by Defendants.

Interrogatory No. 7:
