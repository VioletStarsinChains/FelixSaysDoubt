PLAINTIFF’S COMBINED SET OF DISCOVERY REQUESTS TO DEFENDANT AMAZON

Preamble (Relevance Statement)
Plaintiff Kellyn Clay alleges that Defendants, including Amazon, engaged in retaliatory medical sabotage designed to impair Plaintiff’s ability to speak out loud. Amazon’s roles in supplement distribution, cloud-based health surveillance, and contractual relationships with government agencies make it a relevant party. These interrogatories seek information regarding Amazon’s knowledge of, or participation in, supplement adulteration, speech-impairing medical protocols, and coordination with federal and state entities.

Interrogatories
	1.	Supplement Distribution Oversight
Identify all Amazon programs, partnerships, or compliance systems since 2000 designed to monitor or regulate the distribution of dietary supplements, including vitamin D3, testosterone, or related compounds, and describe whether known risks to vocal capacity were documented.
	2.	Speech-Related Health Data
State whether Amazon Web Services or affiliated cloud services have stored, processed, or analyzed health or biometric data related to Plaintiff’s vocal capacity, speech impairments, or anaphylactic reactions, and identify all government or contractor clients with access to that data.
	3.	Retaliatory Targeting
Describe whether Plaintiff’s expressive activities (speech, writing, online posting, whistleblowing) were ever flagged, reported, or analyzed within Amazon systems, and whether such analysis informed or coincided with medical or supplement interventions.
	4.	Coordination with Government and Contractors
Identify all communications, contracts, or collaborations between Amazon and Palantir Technologies, the Minnesota Department of Health, or federal agencies that involved supplement distribution, biometric surveillance, or speech suppression initiatives.
	5.	Knowledge of Adverse Effects
State whether Amazon possessed knowledge that combined or high-dose administration of vitamin D3, testosterone, or similar products could contribute to vocal cord calcification, muscle mineralization, or other impairments to speech, and describe how that knowledge was applied to product warnings or distribution.
	6.	Narrative Management
Identify whether Amazon communications, policies, or public messaging addressed speech-related side effects of supplements or pharmaceuticals, and describe whether such messaging was influenced by coordination with government or private contractors.

Requests for Production

All consumer complaints, incident reports, or internal studies referencing speech impairment, throat constriction, or anaphylaxis in connection with supplements distributed through Amazon’s platforms.

All documents reflecting monitoring, analysis, or reporting of Plaintiff’s expressive activity (including online postings, speech, or dissenting activity), particularly where such analysis coincided with medical or supplement interventions.
	5.	Government and Contractor Coordination
All contracts, memoranda of understanding, or communications between Amazon and (a) Palantir Technologies, (b) the Minnesota Department of Health, or (c) federal agencies, regarding supplement distribution, health surveillance, or initiatives relating to speech, behavior, or expression.
	6.	Knowledge of Speech-Suppressing Effects
All internal research, risk assessments, or external correspondence that mention or evaluate the potential for vitamin D3, testosterone, or related compounds to contribute to vocal cord calcification, mineralization of muscle/fascia, or impairment of speech.
	7.	Narrative and Messaging
All communications, public-relations materials, or talking points concerning adverse effects of supplements that could impair speech, particularly where messaging was coordinated with government agencies, contractors, or Palantir Technologies.
