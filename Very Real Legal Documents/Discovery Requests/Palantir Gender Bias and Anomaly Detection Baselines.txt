Plaintiff’s Combined Discovery Requests to Defendant Palantir Technologies Inc.

Subject: Gender Bias and Anomaly Detection Baselines

⸻

Interrogatories
	1.	Identify all primary datasets used to establish baseline profiles in Palantir’s anomaly detection systems, including the institutional source (e.g., military, corporate, financial, health).
	2.	State the percentage composition of male and female individuals in each baseline dataset Palantir used for anomaly modeling.
	3.	Describe whether Palantir adjusted, normalized, or otherwise corrected its anomaly detection systems to account for known gender imbalances in baseline data.
	4.	Identify all projects in which Palantir deployed anomaly detection models trained on military-derived data into civilian applications.
	5.	State whether Palantir conducted or received any internal or external warnings, audits, or risk assessments concerning gender bias in anomaly labeling.

⸻

Requests for Admission
	1.	Admit that Palantir has used military datasets to train or inform anomaly detection baselines.
	2.	Admit that such military datasets are overwhelmingly male in composition.
	3.	Admit that Palantir deployed anomaly detection models trained on such datasets into civilian environments without fully correcting for gender imbalance.
	4.	Admit that Palantir’s anomaly detection systems have disproportionately flagged women as anomalies compared to men.
	5.	Admit that Palantir did not adequately warn downstream clients or consumers about the risk of gender-based disparate impact from anomaly detection.

⸻

Requests for Production
	1.	All documents identifying or describing baseline datasets used in Palantir anomaly detection systems.
	2.	All demographic breakdowns (including gender) of individuals represented in such datasets.
	3.	All internal risk assessments, audits, or communications regarding gender bias in anomaly detection.
	4.	All communications between Palantir and government or corporate partners regarding the transfer of military-trained models into civilian applications.
	5.	All reports, presentations, or analyses acknowledging the foreseeable risk of systemic misclassification of women as anomalies.
