REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION
	1.	Admit that Palantir’s anomaly-classification schemas included designations of “Non-Person Entity” (NPE).
	2.	Admit that Palantir’s anomaly-classification schemas did not distinguish between transient, externally induced states (e.g., environmental, chemical, or narrative exposures) and intrinsic, baseline traits.
	3.	Admit that Palantir employees, contractors, or agents were aware that externally induced transient states were being treated as permanent anomaly traits.
	4.	Admit that Palantir’s ontology and data-modeling teams were responsible for defining the parameters of anomaly and NPE classifications.
	5.	Admit that Palantir conducted internal testing or evaluation that revealed false positives or context-stripped anomaly/NPE labels.
	6.	Admit that despite awareness of such false positives, Palantir continued to deliver anomaly/NPE classification outputs to U.S. government clients.
	7.	Admit that Palantir’s program managers or government liaisons were aware that anomaly/NPE classifications were being used operationally by client agencies.
	8.	Admit that Palantir’s legal, compliance, or risk management personnel reviewed anomaly/NPE classification practices.
	9.	Admit that Palantir’s legal, compliance, or risk management personnel were made aware of the due-process implications of anomaly/NPE classifications.
	10.	Admit that Palantir received federal funds under contracts that relied upon anomaly-classification or NPE outputs.
	11.	Admit that Palantir retained such funds despite knowing that anomaly/NPE classifications were derived from context-stripped or distorted data.
	12.	Admit that at least one Palantir employee or executive raised internal concerns about anomaly/NPE classification practices.
	13.	Admit that Palantir did not implement a safeguard or protocol equivalent to the Distortion Quotient (DQ) rule requiring suspension of anomaly/NPE labels when distortion exceeded threshold.
