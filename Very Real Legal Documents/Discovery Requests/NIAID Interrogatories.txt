	2.	State whether NIAID has ever received reports, complaints, or findings that implantable devices (micro/nano or otherwise) can trigger or exacerbate mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) or related histamine disorders.
	3.	Describe in detail any collaborations between NIAID and other federal agencies (including DoD, DARPA, DHS, CDC, or HHS) or private contractors (including Palantir, Deloitte, Booz Allen, Accenture, Oura Health, etc.) involving the use of implant data for predictive modeling, digital twin construction, or behavioral analysis.
	4.	Identify all ethics reviews, Institutional Review Board (IRB) proceedings, or advisory committee discussions convened by NIAID regarding the use of implants in pediatric or neonatal populations.
