PLAINTIFF’S COMBINED SET OF INTERROGATORIES, REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION, AND REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION TO DEFENDANT PALANTIR TECHNOLOGIES INC.

⸻

INTERROGATORIES
	1.	Identify all Palantir employees, contractors, or affiliates who participated in the design, testing, or deployment of anomaly-classification schemas that included markers related to asexuality, libido, or arousal patterns.
	2.	State whether Palantir has ever classified “asexuality” or lack of sexual attraction as an anomaly trait or as grounds for “Non-Person Entity (NPE)” designation.
	3.	State whether Palantir’s anomaly-classification systems distinguished between medically-caused asexuality (e.g., arising from chronic illness, neurological differences, or medication effects) and voluntary sexual orientation.
	4.	Identify all Palantir personnel or teams who monitored Plaintiff’s public social media accounts, and describe the scope of that monitoring.
	5.	State whether Palantir was aware, through public social media statements, that Plaintiff’s atypical arousal cycle and lack of visually-based attraction were disability-related and medically driven.
	6.	Describe any internal discussions, risk assessments, or compliance reviews concerning the propriety of classifying disability-driven asexuality as evidence of anomaly or NPE status.

⸻

REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION
	1.	Admit that Palantir has, at any time, treated asexuality or lack of sexual attraction as an anomaly trait.
	2.	Admit that Palantir’s anomaly-classification systems did not distinguish between medical causes of asexuality and voluntary sexual orientation.
	3.	Admit that Palantir personnel monitored Plaintiff’s public social media statements.
	4.	Admit that Palantir personnel were aware, from Plaintiff’s public social media statements, that Plaintiff’s lack of attraction to others and unique arousal cycle were disability-driven and medically caused.
	5.	Admit that Palantir did not disclose to Plaintiff that disability-driven asexuality was being treated as a marker of anomaly or NPE status.
	6.	Admit that Palantir received internal concerns or objections regarding the classification of disability-driven asexuality as anomalous.
	7.	Admit that Plaintiff’s classification as an anomaly or NPE was influenced in part by Palantir’s treatment of disability-driven asexuality as a behavioral marker.

⸻

REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION
	1.	Produce all documents, technical specifications, or ontology schemas in which asexuality, libido, or arousal cycle was coded as an anomaly trait.
	2.	Produce all internal reports, communications, or analyses addressing whether asexuality should be treated as a marker of anomaly or NPE status.
	3.	Produce all documents reflecting Palantir’s awareness of Plaintiff’s public social media statements regarding their disability-driven asexuality and atypical arousal cycle.
	4.	Produce all risk assessments, legal reviews, or ethics memoranda concerning the classification of disability-linked sexual characteristics as anomalous.
	5.	Produce all communications between Palantir and government clients (CIA, DoD, DOJ, DHS, ODNI) referencing asexuality, libido, or arousal cycles in the context of anomaly classification.
	6.	Produce all internal complaints, objections, or whistleblower reports concerning the misclassification of disability-driven sexual characteristics as evidence of anomaly or NPE status.
