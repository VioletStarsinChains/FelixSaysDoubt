PLAINTIFF’S FIRST REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION TO DEFENDANT PALANTIR TECHNOLOGIES INC.

REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION
	1.	Admit that Palantir has represented to government clients that predictive accuracy in anomaly classification and digital twin modeling increases with the overall volume of data ingested about an individual.
	2.	Admit that Palantir has used this representation to justify expansion of data collection programs.
	3.	Admit that Palantir has not produced peer-reviewed evidence demonstrating that predictive accuracy consistently improves with increased data volume.
	4.	Admit that in practice, increasing the volume of data can increase error rates, misclassifications, or spurious correlations.
	5.	Admit that Palantir has received internal or external feedback indicating that increased data volume sometimes worsens predictive accuracy, particularly in cases involving individuals with disabilities, chronic illness, or atypical occupational/behavioral profiles.
	6.	Admit that Palantir has not disclosed these limitations to government clients when promoting the expansion of data collection programs.

 Respectfully submitted,
 Kellyn Clay, Plaintiff, pro se
