PLAINTIFF’S FIRST SET OF REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION
(to Defendant Palantir Technologies Inc. and associated contracting agencies)

Preamble (Relevance Statement)
Plaintiff Kellyn Clay experienced a targeted incident in Houston in which artificially induced infrasound was perceived, accompanied by a cavitation-like “pop” within the seat of Plaintiff’s vehicle. This sensation was consistent with prior cavitation exposures in medical contexts and suggests the potential use of infrastructure or localized material manipulation to create destructive force without conventional explosives. As Plaintiff has alleged a racketeering enterprise involving covert testing of nontraditional force applications, documents concerning such methods are directly relevant to establishing the scope and mechanisms of Defendants’ enterprise.

Requests for Production
	1.	Weapons Procurement and Testing:
All contracts, subcontracts, invoices, and line-item budgets from 2008 to present concerning the development, acquisition, or testing of weapons systems or force-delivery methods that relied on nontraditional mechanisms, including but not limited to infrasound, pressure-wave induction, or cavitation events.
	2.	Damage and Yield Discrepancies:
All reports, studies, or assessments comparing expected versus observed damage where conventional blast signatures did not match the effects observed in the field, including cases where damage was localized to infrastructure, vehicles, or enclosed spaces.
	3.	Localized Cavitation Applications:
Any internal communications, technical studies, or field reports referencing the induction of cavitation within vehicles, infrastructure, or personal environments for the purpose of creating localized destructive or disruptive effects.
	4.	Infrasound Delivery Systems:
Any documents describing or evaluating the use of infrasound or subsonic wave generators, including methods of amplifying effects by leveraging surrounding materials (e.g., foam seats, building materials, hydraulic fluids, or groundwater).
	5.	Narrative and Cover Mechanisms:
All communications between Palantir, government agencies, or contractors regarding the classification of such methods as “dummy,” “decoy,” or “non-explosive” systems for procurement, accounting, or public-facing reporting purposes.
