PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS

Re: Data Collected During Plaintiff’s Minority (1988–2006)

⸻

REQUEST:
Produce all documents, records, files, communications, databases, contracts, analyses, logs, or derivative materials, whether held directly or indirectly, reflecting any collection, storage, processing, sharing, sale, or exploitation of data pertaining to Plaintiff between June 4, 1988 and June 4, 2006, including but not limited to:
	1.	Biometric or physiological data (e.g., genetic samples, neurophysiological signals, imaging, biometric identifiers).
	2.	Behavioral or psychological data (e.g., test results, school records shared with contractors, personality profiles, surveillance footage, or digital behavior models).
	3.	Neurotechnology or biomedical research data collected covertly or indirectly, including through experimental interventions or stress-testing protocols.
	4.	Commercial surveillance records generated via contracts with data brokers, advertisers, or third-party vendors.
	5.	Any designation, classification, or categorization of Plaintiff as an “anomaly,” “non-person entity (NPE),” or equivalent during this period.
	6.	Communications or agreements between federal agencies and private contractors (including but not limited to Deloitte, Acxiom, Palantir, or their predecessors) pertaining to Plaintiff’s data during this timeframe.

⸻

PURPOSE
This request is necessary to determine the extent of covert data collection and classification activities conducted during Plaintiff’s minority. Federal and international law provides heightened protections for children and minors, rendering any such collection without consent especially unlawful. Plaintiff requires these records to assess whether agencies or contractors violated statutory protections (e.g., COPPA, FERPA, GDPR analogues) or constitutional rights by surveilling or classifying Plaintiff during childhood.
