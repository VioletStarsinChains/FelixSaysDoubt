	2.	NPE Notifications
All documents or communications, internal or external, referencing Plaintiff’s classification, designation, or status as an “anomaly,” “NPE,” or equivalent, prior to or during the period in which her degree was conferred.
	3.	Interagency Communications
Any correspondence, directives, or memoranda between the University and federal agencies (CIA, DoD, DHS, ODNI, Palantir Technologies, or affiliated contractors) relating to:

	•	student classification systems,
	•	restrictions or conditions placed on Plaintiff’s enrollment, academic record, or graduation status.

	6.	Board and Legal Counsel Records

PURPOSE

These requests are intended to determine whether the University knowingly or unknowingly participated in systemic fraud by issuing official documents (including Plaintiff’s diploma) while Plaintiff was covertly classified as a non-person entity (NPE). Such records will reveal whether institutional actors were complicit in or victims of the federal government’s contradictory classification scheme.
