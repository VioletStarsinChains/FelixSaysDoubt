PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court grant the following relief:
	1.	Declaratory Judgment that the creation and deployment of digital twins—AI simulations of individual persons used to generate speech attributable to them—constitutes compelled speech in violation of the First Amendment.
	2.	Injunctive Relief prohibiting Defendants, their agents, contractors, or affiliates from continuing to create, maintain, or deploy digital twins of Plaintiff or similarly situated individuals without express informed consent.
	3.	Data Deletion Order requiring the permanent deletion of all data, outputs, or derivative products generated by any digital twin attributed to Plaintiff, as well as any enhanced surveillance data collected beyond that gathered from an average citizen.
	4.	Protective Order forbidding Defendants from using digital twin outputs as justification for continued or escalated surveillance, targeting, or classification of Plaintiff or others.
	5.	Recognition of Class Applicability extending relief to all individuals whose speech has been compelled through digital twin construction, ensuring that the practice is ended system-wide rather than only with respect to Plaintiff.
	6.	Further Relief as the Court deems just and proper, including material restitution for harms suffered, housing access free from digital twin-based risk scoring, and compensation for any reputational damage caused by false or coerced speech.

Respectfully submitted,
Kellyn Clay, pro se
