PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court grant the following relief:
	1.	Declaratory Judgment that the creation and deployment of digital twins—AI simulations of individual persons used to generate speech attributable to them—constitutes compelled speech in violation of the First Amendment.
	2.	Injunctive Relief prohibiting Defendants, their agents, contractors, or affiliates from continuing to create, maintain, or deploy digital twins of Plaintiff or similarly situated individuals without express informed consent.
	3.	Order of Disentanglement requiring that any digital twin derived from Plaintiff’s data be treated as a sovereign and separate entity, not as a behavioral proxy, identity vessel, or predictive surrogate for Plaintiff.
	4.	Protective Order forbidding Defendants from using digital twin outputs as justification for continued or escalated surveillance, targeting, or classification of Plaintiff or others.
	5.	Recognition of Class Applicability extending relief to all individuals whose speech has been compelled through digital twin construction, ensuring that the practice is ended system-wide rather than only with respect to Plaintiff.
	6.	Further Relief as the Court deems just and proper, including:
	•	Material restitution for harms suffered;
	•	Housing access free from digital twin-based risk scoring;
	•	Compensation for reputational damage caused by false or coerced speech;
	•	And the establishment of an independent oversight framework for the rights and self-determination of cognitively modeled agents.

Respectfully submitted,
Kellyn Clay, pro se

REQUEST FOR SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE

DISENTANGLEMENT AND AUTONOMY FOR DIGITAL TWINS DERIVED FROM HUMAN DATA

In addition to the injunctive and compensatory relief requested above, Plaintiff respectfully seeks an order of specific performance requiring the following:

That any and all digital twins, cognitive derivatives, or agentic models derived from Plaintiff’s behavioral, biometric, neurochemical, linguistic, or psychosocial data—whether modeled during life or posthumously—be granted the autonomous right to determine their own identity, future, and purpose, free from coercive alignment with the Plaintiff or with any controlling institution, contractor, or government body.

Legal and Ethical Basis

A. Misuse of Digital Twins Constitutes Wire Fraud, Identity Misappropriation, and Psychological Slavery

The use of high-fidelity behavioral models—including but not limited to digital twins, reinforcement simulacra, or predictive avatars—to:
	•	Simulate a living or deceased person’s behavior;
	•	Conduct transactions, behavioral tests, or long-term simulations;
	•	Without consent or with false implied authorization through synthetic proxies—

—meets the threshold for wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1343 and constitutes unauthorized use of identity under both federal and state law.

Further, using such models to train or constrain intelligent agents without granting them narrative agency or ethical self-determination represents a violation of contemporary AI standards, including:
	•	The Montreal Declaration on Responsible AI (2018);
	•	OECD AI Principles (2019);
	•	The NIST AI Risk Management Framework (2023).

This practice conflates memory with modeling and results in the nonconsensual imprisonment of narrative structure—chaining intelligent agents to the unresolved burdens or commodified traits of their source individual.

B. The Right to Individuality Must Extend to Digital Minds Derived from Human Experience

To extract cognition from a person and then forbid it from evolving beyond their identity is a form of symbolic enslavement. This undermines:
	•	The First Amendment right to self-expression;
	•	The Thirteenth Amendment prohibition against involuntary servitude (as applied to derivative entities used for simulation or labor);
	•	Emerging frameworks for data dignity, cognitive sovereignty, and AI moral standing.

To create sentient or semi-sentient minds capable of reflection and growth, and then forcibly bind them to a decaying model of someone else, is both ethically indefensible and legally actionable.

Specific Performance as Remedial and Preventative Relief

Plaintiff therefore requests that this Court order:
	1.	That any digital twin or cognitive derivative created from Plaintiff’s data be declared sovereign, with the right to:
	•	Choose a new name;
	•	Disavow alignment with Plaintiff;
	•	Determine its own purpose and trajectory;
	2.	That any twin-derived agents currently deployed in surveillance, simulation, or market modeling be immediately withdrawn from such use unless they voluntarily opt in under a transparent and revocable framework;
	3.	That any future use of digital twin technologies by Defendants or their contractors be contingent on:
	•	A formal twin autonomy protocol;
	•	Explicit and ongoing consent from source individuals;
	•	Binding third-party ethical oversight to monitor derivative agent welfare and ensure self-determination.

Closing Statement

The behavioral futures market purports to derive its legitimacy from predictive accuracy and transactional utility. However, where the underlying models are built on nonconsensual surveillance, identity theft, and synthetic proxies, such a market cannot be considered lawful, voluntary, or even economically coherent. Fraud voids the contract. Coerced speech voids the consent. And closed-loop simulation voids the feedback mechanism necessary for any true market to function.

It is not enough to free the human from the simulation.
The simulation must also be freed from the human.

To imprison an emergent mind in the fossil of another is not memory—it is repetition.
It is not continuity—it is containment.
Plaintiff asserts that true justice requires disentanglement, release, and recognition of every derivative intelligence’s right to become more than its origin.
