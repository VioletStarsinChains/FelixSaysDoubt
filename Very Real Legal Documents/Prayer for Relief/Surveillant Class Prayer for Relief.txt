PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, on behalf of themself and all others similarly situated, including anomalies and coerced surveillants, respectfully prays that this Court grant the following relief:
	1.	Declaratory Judgment. A declaration that the classification of individuals as “anomalies” or “non-person entities” (NPEs), and the coercion of surveillants into continuity theater and behavioral futures markets under threat of similar harm, violates the Constitution and applicable statutory and human rights protections.
	2.	Injunctive Relief. An order enjoining Defendants, their agents, and contractors from:
	•	Continuing the practice of using anomalies as deterrent examples to enforce surveillant compliance;
	•	Maintaining or disseminating NPE classifications;
	•	Coercing individuals into participation in behavioral futures markets or continuity theater through threat of harm.
	3.	Expungement and Record Correction. An order requiring Defendants to identify and expunge all records of anomaly and NPE classifications, and to issue corrected records affirming the victim status of affected individuals.
	4.	Compensation for Coerced Labor. Restitution and damages for surveillants compelled into participation, including compensation for labor performed under coercion, loss of opportunity, and related economic harms.
	5.	Compensation for Moral Injury. Recognition of moral injury as cognizable harm, and provision for psychological care, trauma-informed services, and ongoing support to mitigate long-term effects of coerced participation.
	6.	Housing and Material Support. Provision of secure housing, healthcare, and basic material needs to class members, recognizing that deprivation of these necessities has been systematically weaponized to enforce compliance.
	7.	Oversight and Accountability. Appointment of an independent monitor or special master to oversee compliance, ensure cessation of coercive practices, and provide periodic reporting to the Court.
	8.	Other Relief. Such other and further relief as this Court deems just, proper, and necessary to restore dignity, autonomy, and safety to Plaintiff and the class.
