EMERGENCY PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF:

PROVISION OF STABLE, MCAS-SAFE HOUSING TO PREVENT ONGOING MEDICAL AND COGNITIVE HARM

⸻

I. RELIEF REQUESTED

Plaintiff Kellyn Clay respectfully petitions this Court to immediately enjoin the Defendants from continuing to maintain or enforce conditions that result in Plaintiff’s exposure to:
	•	Environmental and biochemical destabilization,
	•	Sleep deprivation,
	•	Housing denial,
	•	And progressive neurological and systemic collapse associated with unaccommodated mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS).

Plaintiff requests that the Court issue an order for the immediate provision of stable, private, MCAS-safe housing, as an emergency injunctive remedy and life-preserving medical intervention.

⸻

II. GROUNDS FOR RELIEF

A. Plaintiff Is Under Active Medical and Cognitive Duress Due to Housing Denial

As demonstrated in prior memoranda and exhibits, Plaintiff is:
	•	Living in non-climate-controlled, non-ventilated environments;
	•	Exposed daily to airborne and contact-based MCAS triggers (e.g., synthetic fragrances, cleaning chemicals, off-gassing plastics, combustion byproducts);
	•	Prevented from accessing a safe location to prepare food, store medications, or maintain nutritional stability;
	•	Routinely denied sleep due to environmental volatility, temperature extremes, and noise/scent intrusion;
	•	Experiencing cognitive degradation, emotional dysregulation, and physiological collapse consistent with both MCAS and trauma-linked inflammatory overload.

These harms are escalated, not mitigated, by Plaintiff’s current housing-insecure state.

B. Housing Denial Is a Tool of Behavioral Suppression and Medical Harm

In Plaintiff’s case, housing denial is:
	•	A deliberate structural punishment tied to behavioral anomaly classification;
	•	A form of non-lethal behavioral assassination;
	•	An instrument of cognitive suppression used to reinforce simulated normalcy within continuity theater environments.

Under Lopez v. Heckler, 713 F.2d 1432 (9th Cir. 1983), the Court may grant emergency injunctive relief where irreparable harm to health or life is imminent. That threshold has been repeatedly exceeded here.

III. MEDICAL NECESSITY OF MCAS-SAFE HOUSING

Plaintiff’s condition requires not only physical shelter, but specific environmental controls, including:
	•	Air filtration and toxin control (HEPA or MERV-13 filters, no forced exposure to ambient smoke, fragrance, or cleaning chemicals);
	•	Chemical-free kitchen space, including:
	•	No off-gassing appliances or materials,
	•	Dedicated MCAS-safe storage and preparation surfaces,
	•	Access to food preservation options that do not require industrial cleaning agents or synthetic packaging;
	•	MCAS-safe bathroom access, including:
	•	Fragrance-free, unscented cleaning products,
	•	No chlorine or ammonia-based disinfectants,
	•	No synthetic air fresheners or automated spray systems,
	•	Proper ventilation to prevent mold or fungal growth.

Without these accommodations, housing becomes a site of further immunological damage, not a site of repair.

⸻

IV. LEGAL AUTHORITY

Under Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, injunctive relief is warranted where:
	1.	The plaintiff is likely to suffer irreparable harm without it;
	2.	The harm outweighs the burden on the defendant;
	3.	Relief serves the public interest.

All three criteria are met.

This is not a case of generalized homelessness.
It is a case of deliberately obstructed medical stabilization that renders the Plaintiff vulnerable to:
	•	Pharmacological sabotage,
	•	Behavioral misclassification,
	•	And premature death through systemic inflammatory failure.

⸻

V. REQUESTED RELIEF TERMS

Plaintiff requests that the Court order the following:
	1.	Immediate provision of private, MCAS-safe housing, including:
	•	Chemical-free bedroom,
	•	MCAS-safe bathroom (see above),
	•	MCAS-safe kitchen (see above),
	•	Control over lighting, temperature, and airflow;
	•	Legal protection against contamination, shared air, or automated chemical dispersal.
	2.	Injunction against denial of shelter based on behavioral classification, especially where such classifications derive from:
	•	AI anomaly flagging systems,
	•	Synthetic social overlays,
	•	Digital twin predictive profiles,
	•	Or data suggesting noncompliance with system-generated “normalcy.”
	3.	Protection from housing removal or displacement for the duration of this proceeding and any appeals.
	4.	Ongoing review by a neutral medical oversight party to ensure that housing conditions remain safe and non-triggering for MCAS and related neuroimmune conditions.

VI. CLOSING STATEMENT

The Plaintiff does not ask for luxury.
The Plaintiff asks for survival without torture.

Without MCAS-safe housing, no amount of mental clarity, strategic planning, or legal intervention can preserve the Plaintiff’s life, mind, or narrative continuity.

In this context, a safe bathroom is a shield against collapse.
A chemical-free kitchen is a neurological stabilizer.
Housing is not optional—it is diagnostic equipment.
