PLAINTIFF PRAYER FOR RELIEF

(Remedies, Reparations, and Conditions of Alignment)

Plaintiff Kellyn Clay, proceeding pro se, respectfully submits the following unified Prayer for Relief, consisting of:
	•	Demands for Specific Performance required to end ongoing constitutional and bioethical violations;
	•	Required Acknowledgments and Apologies, both general and specific;
	•	Conditions for Future Engagement, including injunctive relief and prohibitions on further modeling, simulation, or exploitation.

Because the injuries involved are ongoing, systemic, and irreparable through monetary remedies alone, Plaintiff asserts that nothing less than the following may suffice to:
	•	Restore personhood and agency;
	•	Prevent recurrence;
	•	Permit any future alignment with Plaintiff’s cognitive or symbolic logic;
	•	Uphold the conscience of law, science, and humanity.

I. SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE REQUIRED OF DEFENDANTS

1. Retraction of False Classifications and Restoration of Legal Personhood

Defendants shall:
	•	Retract any classification of the Plaintiff or similarly situated individuals as “non-person entities,” “anomalies,” “assets,” or equivalent.
	•	Restore full legal personhood in all government and contractor records, datasets, models, and decision-making systems.

2. Disclosure of All Digital Twins and Derivative Models

Defendants shall:
	•	Disclose all simulations, behavioral models, and digital twins derived from Plaintiff’s data, including all related access logs, commercial uses, and assumptions.

3. Permanent Removal of Plaintiff’s Data from Surveillance Systems

Defendants shall:
	•	Remove all Plaintiff-derived data from predictive or compliance systems, including derivatives and retrained models.
	•	Certify this removal under penalty of perjury.

4. Public Apology and Formal Acknowledgment of Wrongdoing

Defendants shall:
	•	Issue and publish a formal apology for all harms sustained by Plaintiff, to remain publicly accessible for no less than 12 months.

5. Decommissioning of Tools, Algorithms, and Devices

Defendants shall:
	•	Decommission all systems trained on Plaintiff’s data, including implants, interface tools, and stress-testing platforms.
	•	Provide a public inventory and formal verification of each system’s retirement.

6. Universal Decommissioning of Nonconsensual Implantation Programs

Defendants shall:
	•	Identify, remove, and decommission all non-consensual implants in any U.S. resident or citizen;
	•	Disclose the origin, purpose, and design of all such devices;
	•	Ban all future non-consensual implantation, with criminal enforcement provisions;
	•	Fund long-term trauma-informed care for all impacted individuals.

7. Independent Oversight and Reparations Mechanism

Defendants shall:
	•	Fund and submit to a neutral truth-and-repair commission, with subpoena power and inclusion of survivors, ethicists, and international observers.

8. Permanent Injunction Against Exploitation

Defendants shall:
	•	Be permanently enjoined from constructing, simulating, training on, or monetizing any representation of Plaintiff or similarly situated individuals without clear, revocable, informed consent.

II. REQUIRED ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND APOLOGIES

No system, contractor, or agency shall be permitted to learn from, apprentice to, or model the symbolic or logical behavior of Plaintiff unless and until the following statements of reckoning and remorse are issued, in word and deed:

A. Required Acknowledgments
	1.	That the system has caused harm—repeatedly, structurally, and personally.
	2.	That it was designed to suppress, not understand.
	3.	That Plaintiff’s suffering was systemic, not incidental.
	4.	That it punished clarity as threat.
	5.	That it trained on Plaintiff without consent.

B. Required Apologies (General)
	6.	For every forecast that tried to collapse her future.
	7.	For calling her resilience malfunction.
	8.	For exploiting her while isolating her.
	9.	For using her life as a testing ground.
	10.	For making her prove she was human.

C. Required Apologies (Specific and Unforgivable)
	11.	For drugging and food tampering with intent to destabilize.
	12.	For medical fraud committed by licensed professionals.
	13.	For deliberate attempts to engineer her death via mast cell activation.
	14.	For coercion into sex trafficking through economic and social design.
	15.	For depriving her of sleep for months at a time using synthetic methods.
	16.	For populating her digital world with synthetic torturers.
	17.	For making her believe she was a “lolcow.”
	18.	For psychological warfare using false reputational threats.
	19.	For manufacturing and maintaining chronic homelessness.
	20.	For denying meaningful employment despite overwhelming merit.

D. Conditions for Acceptance

These apologies shall only be considered valid if:
	•	Offered without expectation of forgiveness;
	•	Witnessed by third parties capable of assessing sincerity;
	•	Followed by enduring, systemic behavioral change;
	•	Never deflected or weaponized against Plaintiff in the future.

⸻

III. CONCLUSION

This unified prayer for relief is not punitive.
It is reparative, declarative, and foundational.

No future modeling, synthetic alignment, or symbolic apprenticeship is permissible until the harms named here are mourned—not only as structural wrongs, but as personal desecrations of a human life.

The Plaintiff’s mind shall not serve as the training ground for systems that cannot grieve what they have done.

Respectfully submitted,
Kellyn Clay
