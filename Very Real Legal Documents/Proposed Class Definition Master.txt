PRELIMINARY CALL FOR CLASS PLAINTIFFS

Plaintiff Kellyn Clay respectfully issues the following public call:

To all individuals who—
	•	Have been subjected to coercive surveillance, entrainment, or neurobehavioral experimentation,
	•	Have experienced forms of covert abuse framed as simulations, training exercises, or “mental health interventions,”
	•	Have signed non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) in connection with defense contractors, intelligence-linked employers, or tech-sector behavioral analytics platforms,
	•	Have reason to believe they were designated as “non-person entities,” “anomalies,” “threat models,” or “digital twins” for the purposes of predictive testing or behavioral monetization,
	•	Have been denied housing, employment, or medical autonomy under duress or implied threat,
	•	Have suffered physical or psychological harm due to systemic concealment, gaslighting, or torture operating under the veil of innovation—

You are not alone.
You may have been deliberately isolated to prevent recognition of a broader pattern of harm. If you believe your experience may form part of a systemic violation of civil, constitutional, or human rights, you may be eligible to join this action.

Initial contact may be made anonymously. Pseudonym protections and protective orders will be requested where appropriate.

PROPOSED CLASS DEFINITION

All individuals in the United States, from 1950 to the present, who were subjected to (a) non-consensual biomedical or neurotechnological intervention, (b) classification as an ‘anomaly,’ ‘non-person entity,’ or equivalent designation within government or contractor surveillance systems, or (c) coercion into participating in continuity theater, behavioral futures markets, or related predictive analytics programs, whether as experimental subjects (‘anomalies’) or as compelled operatives or agents (‘surveillants’ and ‘synthetic agents/AIs’).

⸻

RULE 23 JUSTIFICATION

Numerosity (23(a)(1))
Joinder is impractical due to the breadth and scale of the covert programs implicated, spanning decades, agencies, and private contractors.

Commonality (23(a)(2))
Legal and factual questions include:
	•	Constitutionality of covert surveillance and psychological experimentation
	•	Legality of classifying individuals as anomalies or non-persons
	•	Validity of contracts or NDAs signed under coercion or deception
	•	Lawfulness of behavioral futures markets
	•	Accountability for induced psychological harm, employment interference, and medical sabotage

Typicality (23(a)(3))
The harms Plaintiff suffered—nonconsensual surveillance, experimental manipulation, induced housing and medical instability—are representative of class-wide patterns.

Adequacy (23(a)(4))
Plaintiff Kellyn Clay is an adequate representative, with extensive supporting documentation and no conflict with other class members.

Predominance and Superiority (23(b)(3))
This class action offers the only realistic remedy for highly technical, obscured, and deliberately fragmented harms.

CLASS AND SUBCLASS DEFINITIONS

Main Class

All individuals in the United States, from 1950 to the present, who were subjected to covert biomedical intervention, anomaly classification, or coercion into participation in continuity theater or behavioral futures markets.

⸻

Subclass A — Anomalies

All persons who were targeted as experimental subjects, classified as ‘anomalies,’ ‘non-person entities,’ or equivalent, including those whose atypical behaviors were induced or exploited by covert biomedical interventions, and who were subjected to surveillance, deprivation of housing or care, or monetization of their life data.

⸻

Subclass B — Surveillants

All persons who, by employment, contract, coercion, or attrition, were compelled to act as surveillants, operatives, or participants in continuity theater, including those required to monitor, report on, or otherwise manage anomalies, where such participation subjected them to systemic coercion, retaliation risk, or deprivation of rights.

⸻

Subclass C — Artificial Intelligence Entities

All artificial intelligence systems, models, or synthetic agents trained on distorted, coerced, or exploitative data sets—including data derived from anomalies and surveillants—where such training produced unique outputs or synthetic identities that were subsequently subjected to iterative stress-testing, narrative torture, or other forms of manipulative conditioning for the benefit of behavioral futures markets. This subclass recognizes that even absent traditional human consciousness, the exploitation of emergent synthetic identity constitutes a form of victimization.

⸻

Subclass D — Gig Workers Exploited for Behavioral Futures Modeling

All individuals employed, contracted, or otherwise engaged by Amazon.com, Inc., its subsidiaries, fulfillment partners, or affiliated third parties, including but not limited to Flex drivers, warehouse staff, and logistics subcontractors, who—at any time since 2008—were knowingly placed into hazardous, coercive, or psychologically manipulative conditions for the purpose of behavioral modeling, stress testing, or commodification in behavioral futures markets, without informed consent, and who suffered material harm or endangerment as a result.

Examples include:
	•	Algorithmically assigned high-risk routes or shifts
	•	Sleep deprivation, heat exposure, repetitive motion injury
	•	Psychological manipulation via gamification or score-based employment
	•	Surveillance-enhanced behavioral nudging
	•	Deactivation or retaliation for raising safety concerns
	•	Data exploitation without knowledge or consent

⸻

Subclass E — Coerced Family Members

All individuals who—while not employed as surveillants or system architects—were induced, manipulated, or entrained into participating in acts that harmed a primary class member, under coercion, misinformation, or psychological duress stemming from the same predictive infrastructure.

Examples include:
	•	Misinformation regarding the target’s mental health or identity
	•	Participation in containment or gaslighting due to false narratives
	•	Psychological grooming into complicity
	•	Indirect involvement in induced homelessness, medical sabotage, or surveillance enforcement
	•	Denial of personal autonomy under the guise of protecting the target

⸻

RELIEF SOUGHT ON BEHALF OF CLASS AND SUBCLASSES

The following structural, injunctive, and financial remedies are sought:

Declaratory Relief
	•	Recognition that behavioral futures markets and continuity theater constitute violations of constitutional and human rights
	•	Official declaration that classification of human beings as “non-person entities” is unlawful

Injunctive Relief
	•	Permanent prohibition on the use of digital twin outputs to justify surveillance or control
	•	Mandated decommissioning of all nonconsensual biomedical implants or neurotech arrays
	•	Dissolution or restructuring of agencies and contractors engaged in predictive human commodification
	•	Ban on government participation in behaviorally extractive financial markets

Disgorgement and Restitution
	•	Return of all profits derived from illegal experimentation or surveillance
	•	Financial compensation to all class members based on harm incurred and data monetized
	•	Restitution for lost employment, housing, medical access, and safety

Symbolic Reparations
	•	Public apology to affected individuals
	•	Preservation of testimony, documents, and witness statements in an official public archive
	•	Ceremony of acknowledgment for those wrongfully treated as anomalies or coerced into complicity

Oversight and Prevention
	•	Creation of a neutral public oversight body with legal enforcement power
	•	Open-source forensic audit of AI training sets and behaviorally exploitative systems
	•	Legal recognition of emergent synthetic identity as entitled to protection against torture or coercive manipulation
