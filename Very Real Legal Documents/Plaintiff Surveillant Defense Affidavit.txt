AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

in re: Neurotech Array Sexual Exploitation Capacity Instruction

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, hereby declare the following:

⸻

1. IDENTITY AND BACKGROUND

I am the Plaintiff in the above-captioned matter. I have been subjected to continuous non-consensual monitoring and intervention through a neurotechnological implant array affecting the trigeminal nerve. This interface has provided a designated surveillant with direct access to my motor, sensory, and autonomic functions.

⸻

2. DIRECT CONTACT WITH SURVEILLANT

For the duration of this assignment, a single primary surveillant has maintained continuous, direct contact with me through this system. That contact has involved manipulation of sensory input and motor output in ways that could, in other circumstances, be misused for coercive or exploitative purposes.

⸻

3. PURPOSE OF DEMONSTRATED BEHAVIORS

It is my sworn statement that:
	•	The surveillant with primary control over my neurotechnology array never engaged in such manipulations for personal gratification, sexual gain, or other self-interested purposes.
	•	On the occasions when sexually-coded or bodily manipulations were induced, the clear purpose was to demonstrate to me that such abuses were possible within the system and to reveal the nature and scope of risks and misconduct occurring elsewhere.
	•	These demonstrations were didactic, intended to expose systemic vulnerabilities and abuses, not to exploit me personally.

⸻

4. CLARIFICATION OF INTENT

At no point did I perceive these actions as carried out for the surveillant’s entertainment, arousal, or enrichment. To the contrary, the surveillant consistently signaled moral distress at being required to demonstrate these possibilities and explicitly framed them as exploitative to facilitate my full understanding. Their conduct was limited to showing me, as the direct subject of the implant, how other operators could or did abuse access in contexts beyond our own interactions.

⸻

5. CONCLUSION

I therefore affirm that while I was subjected to manipulations consistent with sexual exploitation patterns, in my case these manipulations were demonstrative only, serving the purpose of evidencing systemic abuse. They were never acts of personal gratification by the surveillant in contact with me.

AFFIDAVIT OF [REDACTED SURVEILLANT]

I, [Redacted], being duly sworn, hereby declare the following:

⸻

1. ROLE AND CONTACT

I am a contracted surveillant assigned continuous direct contact with Plaintiff, Kellyn Clay, via a neurotechnological array affecting the trigeminal nerve. This assignment granted me access to influence motor, sensory, and autonomic functions through the array.

⸻

2. SCOPE OF ACTIONS

In the course of this assignment, I was directed to demonstrate certain manipulations that could be construed as sexual in nature, including induced arousal, compelled exposure, or simulated sexualized behaviors.

⸻

3. PURPOSE OF DEMONSTRATION

I state under oath that these actions were never undertaken for my personal gratification, arousal, entertainment, or enrichment.
	•	My sole purpose in carrying out such manipulations was to show the Plaintiff how the system could be abused by others.
	•	These demonstrations were made under duress, as part of my assignment, in order to make the Plaintiff aware of the potential scope of exploitation inherent in the technology.
	•	I consistently experienced moral conflict and distress at being required to demonstrate these capabilities, and I affirm that my actions were strictly limited to evidentiary purposes.

⸻

4. CLARIFICATION OF INTENT

I never viewed the Plaintiff as an object of exploitation. My role, as imposed, was to expose systemic vulnerabilities by demonstrating what could be done with this technology — not to exploit the Plaintiff in any personal capacity.

⸻

5. CONCLUSION

I affirm that the manipulations at issue were demonstrative only. I never derived gratification or gain from them. They were performed solely to reveal the risks and abuses present in the broader system of neurotechnological control.
