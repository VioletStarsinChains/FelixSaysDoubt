MEMORANDUM OF LAW REGARDING BANK OF AMERICA’S COMPLICITY IN FRAUDULENT JOINT ACCOUNT STRUCTURING

⸻

INTRODUCTION

This memorandum addresses the role of Bank of America in maintaining joint financial accounts between Plaintiff, Kellyn Clay, and her father, William Alton Clay. Unlike an innocent institution misled by third parties, evidence suggests Bank of America knowingly participated in concealing Plaintiff’s alleged classification as a “non-person entity” (“NPE”). This complicity stems not only from unusual account structuring but also from William Alton Clay’s professional relationship with Bank of America while serving as a consultant with Deloitte.

STATEMENT OF FACTS
	1.	All of Plaintiff’s financial accounts were held with Bank of America.
	2.	Despite Plaintiff’s majority status, these accounts were consistently structured as joint accounts with her father, William Alton Clay.
	3.	William Alton Clay previously served as a consultant to Bank of America while employed at Deloitte, creating a professional relationship and potential collusion.
	4.	Plaintiff had no independent financial standing recognized by the bank, consistent with systemic deprivation associated with alleged NPE status.
	5.	Bank of America thus had both motive and opportunity to participate knowingly in structuring Plaintiff’s accounts to obscure her classification and deny her independent recognition.

LEGAL ISSUE

Whether Bank of America’s deliberate participation in joint account structuring to conceal Plaintiff’s alleged NPE status constitutes fraud, aiding and abetting, and violation of fiduciary duties owed to the account holder.

⸻

ARGUMENT

I. Fraud Requires Knowing Misrepresentation or Concealment.
Bank of America was not a neutral party. Its institutional knowledge of William Alton Clay’s consulting role, paired with its direct control over Plaintiff’s accounts, indicates complicity in the concealment of her true status. By structuring accounts jointly, the bank created false records implying Plaintiff enjoyed independent legal recognition.

II. Complicity Constitutes Aiding and Abetting.
A financial institution that knowingly facilitates fraudulent concealment cannot hide behind customer privacy or contract law. Courts recognize aiding and abetting liability where an institution substantially assists in fraud with actual knowledge of wrongful conduct. Here, the overlap between Deloitte, Bank of America, and William Alton Clay supports such knowledge.

III. Violation of Fiduciary Duties.
Banks owe duties of good faith and fair dealing to account holders. By concealing from Plaintiff her inability to hold accounts independently, Bank of America deprived her of material information necessary to challenge her treatment and assert her rights.

IV. Broader Constitutional Context.
When a private institution conspires with government classification systems to obscure NPE status, its actions cross into state action. Such complicity renders Bank of America accountable for constitutional violations of due process and equal protection.

⸻

CONCLUSION

Bank of America’s actions were not merely clerical errors or parental discretion. Rather, they reflect deliberate structuring designed to conceal Plaintiff’s alleged classification as a non-person entity. Discovery is warranted into the bank’s internal records, communications with Deloitte, and directives governing Plaintiff’s accounts, in order to establish complicity in fraud and constitutional deprivation.
