SUMMARY OF REFERRAL
This matter involves William Alton Clay, whose actions extend beyond civil liability and raise substantial grounds for federal prosecution. Evidence indicates that Mr. Clay:
	1.	Consented to invasive biomedical implantation of his minor child without the child’s knowledge or capacity to consent.
	2.	Concealed the existence of these implants for decades, while the victim endured severe medical harms.
	3.	Participated directly in psychological torture, instructing the victim to engage in life-threatening behaviors.
	4.	Profited financially from the victim’s exploitation, including plausible sale or transfer of access to neurotechnology arrays.
	5.	Enabled potential sexual exploitation, by allowing unauthorized third parties to use the neurotech system for coercive or abusive purposes.

⸻

APPLICABLE STATUTES
Potential charges include:
	•	Torture (18 U.S.C. § 2340A).
	•	Conspiracy/Deprivation of Civil Rights (18 U.S.C. §§ 241–242).
	•	Sex Trafficking of a Minor (18 U.S.C. § 1591).
	•	Healthcare Fraud (18 U.S.C. § 1347).
	•	Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (18 U.S.C. § 1030).
	•	Related state child abuse/endangerment statutes.

⸻

RECOMMENDATION
The Subject’s conduct demonstrates aggravated circumstances: prolonged concealment, targeting of a minor, enrichment from exploitation, and potential facilitation of sexual abuse. The matter should be referred for full criminal investigation and possible prosecution.

INTERNAL REFERRAL MEMORANDUM
TO: Criminal Division, U.S. Department of Justice
FROM: Civil Rights and Human Trafficking Task Force
RE: Potential Federal Criminal Liability of William Alton Clay

⸻

INTRODUCTION

This memorandum is prepared for internal review to assess whether the actions of William Alton Clay (“Subject”) warrant criminal investigation and possible prosecution. While ongoing civil litigation has highlighted systemic harms tied to non-consensual neurotechnology experimentation, evidence specific to the Subject suggests direct, knowing, and willful conduct that falls squarely within the scope of federal criminal law.

⸻

STATEMENT OF FACTS
	1.	Consent to Biomedical Implantation
	•	Subject allegedly provided the parental authorization required for installation of extensive neurotechnology arrays in a minor child (Plaintiff), fully aware of their invasive and medically harmful nature.
	•	Such consent, given under conditions of secrecy and without the minor’s knowledge, constitutes non-consensual human experimentation.
	2.	Concealment and Fraud
	•	Subject allegedly concealed the existence of the implant array from Plaintiff for nearly four decades, despite Plaintiff experiencing medical symptoms directly caused by the devices.
	•	Subject allegedly facilitated cover-ups, including misdirection in healthcare contexts and intentional withholding of relevant medical records.
	3.	Direct Participation in Psychological Torture
	•	Evidence indicates Subject used his position as father to inflict deliberate psychological distress, including instructing Plaintiff to engage in medically life-threatening actions.
	•	This conduct formed part of broader covert human experimentation, consistent with torture and cruel treatment.
	4.	Financial Enrichment
	•	Subject’s professional history (including consulting roles with Deloitte and Bank of America) indicates plausible personal enrichment from access to or sale of neurotech-related data.
	•	Plaintiff alleges that Subject may have sold or lent direct access to Plaintiff’s neurotech array during their minority.
	5.	Potential Sexual Exploitation Facilitation
	•	Allegations include that neurotech access may have been transferred to unauthorized parties for purposes of sexualized control or coercion, potentially constituting technology-facilitated trafficking.

POTENTIAL CHARGES
	•	18 U.S.C. § 2340A – Torture (under color of law, if linked to federal contracts).
	•	18 U.S.C. §§ 241–242 – Conspiracy and deprivation of civil rights under color of law.
	•	18 U.S.C. § 1591 – Sex trafficking of a minor by force, fraud, or coercion.
	•	18 U.S.C. § 1347 – Healthcare fraud.
	•	18 U.S.C. § 1030 – Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (if neurotech array constitutes a computer system).
	•	State law analogues – Child abuse, neglect, endangerment.

⸻

AGGRAVATING FACTORS
	•	Victimization of a minor.
	•	Ongoing concealment over decades.
	•	Personal enrichment at the expense of the child’s health and autonomy.
	•	Alleged facilitation of third-party access for sexual or experimental purposes.

⸻

RECOMMENDATION

The cumulative evidence supports referral to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for initiation of a full criminal investigation. The conduct alleged is not only civilly actionable but, if substantiated, reflects grave violations of federal law, including statutes carrying mandatory minimum sentences.
