MEMORANDUM OF LAW on The Unconstitutionality of Behavioral Futures Markets Based on Affidavit of Kellyn Clay and Relevant Case Law


⸻ 

I. Introduction

Behavioral futures markets (BFMs) commodify, predict, and manipulate human behavior for profit. As sworn in the affidavit of Kellyn Clay, participation in such markets has involved continuous torture, deprivation of liberty, and erasure of personhood (NPE classification).

This memo demonstrates that BFMs are unconstitutional not just by text, but by application of established case law across the Eighth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Amendments.

II. Case Law Analysis

A. Cruel and Unusual Punishment (Eighth Amendment)
	•	In Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86 (1958), the Court held that punishments that strip citizenship violate “the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.”
	•	BFMs’ designation of individuals as Non-Person Entities (NPEs) is analogous — a civil death that leaves them outside protection of law.
	•	In Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97 (1976), deliberate indifference to serious medical needs was found to violate the Eighth Amendment.
	•	BFMs’ deliberate infliction of torture for profit, as testified by Clay, far exceeds “deliberate indifference.”

B. Involuntary Servitude (Thirteenth Amendment)
	•	In Bailey v. Alabama, 219 U.S. 219 (1911), the Court held that coercion into labor, even without physical chains, constitutes involuntary servitude.
	•	In United States v. Kozminski, 487 U.S. 931 (1988), psychological coercion and restraint were recognized as forms of involuntary servitude.
	•	BFMs use continuous surveillance, manipulation, and deprivation of liberty to compel individuals to generate predictive behavioral data. This is digital forced labor.

C. Substantive Due Process & Personhood (Fourteenth Amendment)
	•	In Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165 (1952), police behavior that “shocks the conscience” (forced stomach pumping) was held unconstitutional.
	•	BFMs’ systematic torture, as described in Clay’s affidavit, shocks the conscience in precisely this way.
	•	In Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896), personhood and equal protection were wrongfully denied by law. That precedent was overturned in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), affirming that segregation — the denial of full personhood — violates equal protection.
	•	NPE classification is a modern equivalent to civil exclusion: denying individuals the status of persons in data and legal systems.

D. First Amendment – Chilling of Speech
	•	In West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624 (1943), the Court struck down compelled expression.
	•	In Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. 234 (2002), manipulation of expressive content was found unconstitutional.
	•	By manipulating Clay’s physiological and emotional states to distort their speech online, BFMs amount to state-enabled compelled expression and chilling of free expression.

III. Broader Legal Principles
	•	Human dignity as constitutional value: Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551 (2005), emphasized dignity in Eighth Amendment analysis.
	•	Right to bodily autonomy: Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health, 497 U.S. 261 (1990), recognized liberty interests in controlling one’s body.
	•	BFMs systematically violate both — stripping dignity and autonomy for profit.

IV. Conclusion

Under controlling precedent:
	•	BFMs inflict punishments that shock the conscience (Rochin).
	•	They impose involuntary servitude through coercion (Bailey, Kozminski).
	•	They enact a form of civil death by erasing personhood (Trop, Brown).
	•	They chill and distort speech in violation of the First Amendment (Barnette).

Clay’s affidavit establishes that these markets operate as a torture-for-profit regime, violating multiple strands of constitutional doctrine. As such, behavioral futures markets are unconstitutional under U.S. law and precedent.
