Plaintiff’s Motion for Permanent Injunction Barring the Categorization of Any Human Person as a Non-Person Entity (NPE)

I. Introduction

Plaintiff Kellyn Clay respectfully moves this Court for a permanent injunction prohibiting Defendants, their agents, and all affiliated contractors from categorizing, classifying, or treating any human person — living or deceased — as a Non-Person Entity (NPE) or by any analogous designation.

II. Factual Background
	1.	Plaintiff has reason to believe that U.S. agencies and defense contractors have developed or deployed systems that recategorize human beings as anomalies, NPEs, or similar non-person classifications.
	2.	Such categorizations strip individuals of their constitutional personhood, facilitate covert experimentation, and undermine the basic guarantees of due process and equal protection.
	3.	The practice is not limited to the living. It extends to deceased persons whose data and identities are exploited under the false premise that constitutional protections no longer apply.
	4.	This constitutes a structural assault on the constitutional order, in which all human beings are recognized as persons endowed with rights that cannot be erased by reclassification.

III. Legal Basis

A. Constitutional Personhood
	•	The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments protect the rights of “persons” without qualification.
	•	No statute, regulation, or covert practice can override this baseline recognition.

B. Prohibition of Arbitrary Reclassification
	•	Courts have consistently rejected governmental acts that nullify personhood or rights by administrative fiat.
	•	Categorical exclusion from personhood would be tantamount to outlawry and is fundamentally unconstitutional.

C. Irreparable Harm
	•	Categorizing individuals as NPEs enables torture, silencing, and experimentation outside the rule of law.
	•	Such harm is irreparable and cannot be compensated after the fact.

IV. Relief Requested

Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court issue a permanent injunction providing that:
	1.	Defendants and their contractors are permanently barred from categorizing or treating any human being, living or dead, as a Non-Person Entity (NPE) or analogous designation;
	2.	Any such classification already in use shall be declared void ab initio;
	3.	Agencies and contractors shall certify the removal of NPE designations from all systems, databases, and operational frameworks;
	4.	No future system of surveillance, prediction, or biomanipulation shall employ NPE or anomaly classifications as applied to human persons.

V. Conclusion

The recognition of human beings as “persons” under law is the foundation of constitutional order. The practice of reclassifying humans as NPEs violates this principle at its core. Plaintiff therefore prays this Court grant the requested injunction in full.

Respectfully submitted,

Kellyn Clay
Plaintiff, pro se
