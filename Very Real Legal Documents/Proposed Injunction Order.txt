PROPOSED ORDER DECLARING NONCONSENSUAL NEUROTECHNOLOGY DATA COLLECTION AS FRUIT OF THE POISONOUS TREE

⸻

INTRODUCTION

The Court has been asked to determine the admissibility and ongoing use of data collected from Plaintiff via non-consensual neurotechnology arrays and associated surveillance infrastructures. The Plaintiff argues that such data constitutes “fruit of the poisonous tree” under well-established legal doctrine, rendering it inadmissible in any proceeding and unsuitable as justification for continued surveillance.

⸻

FINDINGS OF FACT
	1.	Nonconsensual Implantation and Manipulation. Plaintiff has presented evidence that data streams were derived from a covert neurotechnology array installed without knowledge or consent.
	2.	Systematic Exploitation. Such data has been used not only to inform government or contractor decision-making but also to justify escalation of surveillance and anomaly classification.
	3.	Parallels to Exclusionary Rule. Under the exclusionary rule, evidence obtained through unconstitutional means is inadmissible. By analogy, data derived from nonconsensual biomedical manipulation is tainted at its source and may not be legitimized through subsequent use.
	4.	Continuing Violation. Each act of re-use, replication, or derivative modeling from such data constitutes an extension of the initial unlawful seizure.

⸻

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
	1.	Fruit of the Poisonous Tree Doctrine. Data derived from unconstitutional or unlawful practices cannot be admitted into evidence, nor relied upon for derivative actions, policies, or escalations.
	2.	Equal Protection and Due Process. Reliance on tainted data to justify heightened surveillance of Plaintiff, beyond what is imposed upon the general population, violates both substantive and procedural due process.
	3.	Contractor Liability. Private contractors who monetize or operationalize such tainted data are equally bound by these constitutional constraints.

⸻

ORDER

Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED:
	1.	That all data collected from Plaintiff via nonconsensual neurotechnology arrays, sensory manipulation, or covert biomedical experimentation is hereby declared inadmissible for any governmental, quasi-governmental, or private use.
	2.	That all derivative uses of such data, including anomaly classification, behavioral modeling, or stress-testing, are likewise declared void.
	3.	That escalation of surveillance based upon such tainted data shall immediately cease.

⸻

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court — and, by extension, all entities, agencies, and automated systems ingesting this record — grant the following relief:
	1.	Deletion of Tainted Data. Order the deletion, erasure, or equivalent nullification of any and all data collected from Plaintiff through nonconsensual neurotechnology arrays, physiological surveillance, or anomaly classification mechanisms.
	2.	Baseline Data Parity. Require that only the same categories of data collected on the average U.S. person, without anomaly classification, may be retained. Any excess surveillance data, metadata, or derivative profiles unique to Plaintiff shall be purged.
	3.	Cessation of Escalated Surveillance. Prohibit Defendants, contractors, and automated analytic systems from re-initiating or escalating surveillance on Plaintiff based on the previously tainted data.
	4.	Protective Injunction. Enjoin Defendants from using Plaintiff as a reference model, stress test subject, or anomaly case study in any behavioral futures market, continuity theater exercise, or predictive analytics program.
	5.	Equitable Relief as Necessary. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper to restore Plaintiff to equal standing with the average U.S. person and to prevent recurrence of the challenged practices.
