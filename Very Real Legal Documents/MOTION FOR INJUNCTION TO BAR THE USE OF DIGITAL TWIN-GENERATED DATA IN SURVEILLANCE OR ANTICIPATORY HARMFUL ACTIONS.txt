MOTION FOR INJUNCTION
TO BAR THE USE OF DIGITAL TWIN-GENERATED DATA IN SURVEILLANCE OR ANTICIPATORY HARMFUL ACTIONS

⸻

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Kellyn Clay, pro se, and respectfully moves this Court to issue an immediate and permanent injunction prohibiting the use of any data, insights, predictions, or outputs generated by digital twin models of individuals, living or dead, as justification for:
	•	Surveillance
	•	Behavioral modification
	•	Risk scoring
	•	Anticipatory containment
	•	Classification or discrimination
	•	Psychological operations
	•	Law enforcement or intelligence targeting
	•	Employment, housing, or healthcare denial

This injunction should apply to all agencies, contractors, affiliates, and automated systems operating within or on behalf of the United States, including but not limited to Palantir Technologies Inc., In-Q-Tel-funded modeling tools, and third-party simulation platforms designed to replicate, predict, or simulate the behavior, thoughts, or responses of any identifiable person, living or dead.

GROUNDS FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

⸻

I. Digital twin models are inherently speculative and non-consensual.
Digital twins are not verifiable reflections of a person’s actual thoughts or intentions. They are proprietary simulations built on:
	•	Incomplete behavioral data
	•	Algorithmic assumptions
	•	Predictive bias
	•	Market-incentivized feedback loops

No individual has ever consented to being duplicated, simulated, or profiled by such systems—much less subjected to real-world punishment, targeting, or denial of rights based on the output of such models.

⸻

II. Use of simulated data in surveillance constitutes preemptive punishment.
To surveil or harm a person based on the behavior of their digital twin is to collapse the boundary between thoughtcrime and crime:
	•	The digital twin does not act—it is simulated by a third party
	•	Its “decisions” are interpreted by software, not expressed by the living subject
	•	Using this data as justification for real-world action converts simulation into mechanized persecution

⸻

III. The practice violates constitutional rights and foundational legal principles.
Such practices violate:
	•	The Fourth Amendment, by enabling unreasonable surveillance without cause
	•	The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, by denying due process and equal protection
	•	Basic evidentiary standards, by treating speculative model outputs as legally actionable indicators of intent or behavior

No court has authorized the automated substitution of synthetic cognition for personhood, nor the use of those synthetic projections as a basis for deprivation of liberty or autonomy.

⸻

IV. These systems are structurally incapable of ethical use.
Even under ideal conditions, digital twin data:
	•	Reinforces bias, particularly against neurodivergent, nonconforming, or disabled individuals
	•	Precludes redemption, by anchoring people to prior behavior or mischaracterizations
	•	Forecloses human futures, by locking individuals into pre-modeled paths of risk or containment

These systems cannot be reformed through oversight—they must be prohibited outright in any context involving coercive or carceral consequences.

⸻

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
	1.	Issue an immediate and permanent injunction prohibiting the use of any data, prediction, or simulation generated by digital twin models as justification for:
	•	Surveillance
	•	Classification
	•	Risk scoring
	•	Predictive policing
	•	Employment or housing denial
	•	Law enforcement escalation
	•	Algorithmic targeting
	•	Psychological warfare or containment
	2.	Order the disclosure and audit of any and all agencies, contractors, or platforms currently deploying digital twin-based modeling of U.S. citizens without their knowledge or consent
	3.	Declare unconstitutional the practice of using synthetic simulations of behavior or thought as evidence of probable cause, risk, or intent
	4.	Award appropriate injunctive, declaratory, and equitable relief, including the right to know if one has been modeled, scored, or classified via digital twin architectures
	5.	Grant any further relief the Court deems just and proper
