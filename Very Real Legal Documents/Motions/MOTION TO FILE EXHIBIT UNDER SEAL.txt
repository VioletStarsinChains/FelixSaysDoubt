UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, et al.,
  Defendants.

PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO FILE EXHIBIT UNDER SEAL

Plaintiff Kellyn Clay, proceeding pro se, respectfully moves this Court for leave to file Exhibit [X] under seal pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5.2(d) and the Court’s inherent authority to protect sensitive information.

⸻

I. Background
	1.	Plaintiff intends to submit as Exhibit [X] a roster of students who attended Eastside Christian School (Marietta, GA) between 1999 and 2001.
	2.	Plaintiff believes that systemic nonconsensual medical experimentation may have been conducted upon this entire cohort, including possible covert implantation.
	3.	The list of student names is provided to enable discovery, including the potential for subpoenas, cross-referencing of field trip rosters, and identification of additional witnesses or victims.

⸻

II. Need for Sealing
	4.	The roster contains personally identifying information (PII) of minors at the time of attendance.
	5.	Public disclosure of these names, outside the discovery process, could expose former students to unnecessary stigma, privacy invasion, or reputational harm.
	6.	Filing the roster under seal ensures that the Court may review the information and use it to guide discovery without releasing it to the public domain.

⸻

III. Proposed Handling
	7.	Plaintiff requests that the Court permit Exhibit [X] to be filed under seal and reviewed in camera (by the judge only) as necessary.
	8.	Plaintiff further requests that the Court limit access to Defendants and their counsel only if and when the Court determines it is relevant to discovery.

⸻

IV. Conclusion

For these reasons, Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court grant leave to file Exhibit [X] (student roster) under seal.
