Motion for Electronic Service

Plaintiff: Kellyn Clay
Defendant(s): [Starbucks Corporation, et al.]
Case No.: [to be assigned]
Court: United States District Court for the District of Minnesota

Motion

Plaintiff Kellyn Clay, appearing pro se, respectfully moves this Court for an order authorizing electronic service of all filings, pleadings, and discovery materials in the above-captioned matter.

Grounds
	1.	Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 5(b)(2)(E), service may be made “by electronic means if the person consented in writing.” Courts also have inherent authority to order alternative service methods when warranted.
	2.	Plaintiff cannot reliably receive residential mail due to current circumstances. Without electronic service, Plaintiff risks delayed or missed filings that would impair the ability to participate meaningfully in this case.
	3.	Plaintiff has continuous access to electronic communication and designates the following email address for service: [insert your email address].
	4.	Plaintiff also requests, if permitted, to be granted electronic filing access through the Court’s CM/ECF system so that both filing and service may be handled electronically.
	5.	Authorizing electronic service will ensure fairness, efficiency, and compliance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Relief Requested

Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court enter an order directing that:
	•	All filings, pleadings, discovery requests, discovery responses, and other documents in this matter may be served on Plaintiff by electronic means (via CM/ECF and/or the designated email address provided above); and
	•	Such service shall be treated as equivalent to service by U.S. Mail under Fed. R. Civ. P. 5(b)(2)(C).

Respectfully submitted,

⸻
