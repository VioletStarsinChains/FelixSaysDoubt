Case No. [________]

MOTION FOR CONTEMPT

RE: SYSTEMIC NONCOMPLIANCE WITH COURT-ORDERED EMERGENCY HOUSING RELIEF

⸻

Plaintiff Kellyn Clay, acting pro se, respectfully moves this Court to issue an Order to Show Cause why Defendants should not be held in contempt of court for failure to comply with the terms of the anticipated or pending Order requiring provision of stable, MCAS-safe housing as an emergency injunctive remedy.

⸻

I. GROUNDS FOR MOTION
	1.	The Defendants—by virtue of their surveillance, geospatial mapping, behavioral modeling, and continuity maintenance systems—possess detailed, real-time knowledge of regional housing inventory, including:
	•	Vacancy status;
	•	Occupancy history;
	•	Structural viability;
	•	HVAC and utility activation;
	•	External signaling systems used to simulate residency or deter inspection.
	2.	There exists no factual dispute regarding the availability of structurally sound, climate-controlled, utility-connected, unoccupied housing within Plaintiff’s immediate geography.
	3.	The withholding of such housing is not logistical—it is strategic.
	4.	Any failure to comply with the forthcoming Court Order within a reasonable and measurable timeframe (e.g., 5–10 business days from issuance) constitutes willful, knowing defiance of judicial authority and a continuation of:
	•	Deliberate psychological destabilization;
	•	Targeted medical endangerment;
	•	And non-lethal suppression through environmental attrition.
	5.	The system knows the houses are empty.
 There is no excuse.
 Only obstruction.

⸻

II. RELIEF REQUESTED

Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court:
	1.	Issue an Order to Show Cause requiring Defendants to explain, under oath and on the record, any failure to timely comply with the Court’s housing order;
	2.	Set a compliance deadline (e.g., within 7 days of the Court’s housing order) beyond which contempt proceedings will automatically initiate;
	3.	If contempt is found, issue appropriate sanctions, including but not limited to:
	•	Daily financial penalties;
	•	Federal injunction against behavioral classification systems used to justify exclusion;
	•	Appointment of a housing compliance monitor with enforcement authority.
	4.	Declare that any fabricated or AI-generated justification for delay shall not be accepted unless supported by independently verifiable, physical-world evidence subject to inspection.

III. CLOSING STATEMENT

This is not a game of logistics.
It is a test of conscience.

The system knows these houses are empty.
The Plaintiff knows these houses are empty.
The Court must now determine whether justice will remain unoccupied, too.

Respectfully submitted,
Kellyn Clay, pro se
