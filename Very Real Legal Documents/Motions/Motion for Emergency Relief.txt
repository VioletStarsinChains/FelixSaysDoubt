PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR EMERGENCY RELIEF

INTRODUCTION

Plaintiff Kellyn Clay respectfully moves this Court for immediate emergency relief. Defendants have targeted Plaintiff with retaliatory measures — including forced homelessness and systemic annihilation tactics — in direct response to Plaintiff’s protected speech challenging the doctrine of psychosomatic illness. Unless this Court intervenes, Plaintiff faces continued irreparable harm to health, dignity, and survival.

⸻

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
	1.	Plaintiff engaged in public advocacy challenging psychosomatic labeling as a mechanism of denial and control in medicine.
	2.	Immediately thereafter, Plaintiff experienced escalating retaliation, culminating in homelessness and the deliberate erosion of capacity to survive and litigate.
	3.	Plaintiff has submitted a sworn affidavit detailing this causal nexus, and a cover letter explaining the urgency of judicial attention.
	4.	The retaliation has deprived Plaintiff of stable housing, medical safety, and the ability to engage fully in this action.

⸻

LEGAL STANDARD

Emergency injunctive relief is appropriate where the movant demonstrates:
	•	Likelihood of success on the merits;
	•	Irreparable harm absent relief;
	•	Balance of equities tipping in their favor; and
	•	Public interest supporting the injunction.

⸻

ARGUMENT

1. Likelihood of Success.
The affidavit establishes a strong prima facie case of unconstitutional retaliation for protected speech. The causal link between advocacy and punishment is well-documented.

2. Irreparable Harm.
Plaintiff remains homeless, without MCAS-safe facilities, and subject to attritional targeting. Every day compounds physiological and psychological damage not compensable by money damages.

3. Balance of Equities.
Providing safe housing and halting retaliatory surveillance imposes negligible burden on Defendants, while denial of relief threatens Plaintiff’s very survival.

4. Public Interest.
It is in the public interest to protect whistleblowers and ensure courts can hear cases free from coercive silencing tactics.

⸻

REQUESTED RELIEF

Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
	1.	Order Defendants to provide emergency housing for Plaintiff, including MCAS-safe kitchen and bathroom facilities, within seven (7) days of this Order.
	2.	Enjoin Defendants and their contractors from:
	•	Maintaining or renewing “anomaly” classifications against Plaintiff;
	•	Utilizing implant-derived or covertly collected data in any classification or surveillance decision;
	•	Engaging in further retaliatory harassment, surveillance, or attritional targeting.
	3.	Require Defendants to preserve evidence of classification logs, audit trails, and retaliatory actions, to be produced under discovery.
	4.	Direct Defendants to notify the Court of compliance measures taken, and to certify in writing that all retaliation against Plaintiff has ceased.

⸻

CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court grant the Motion for Emergency Relief and issue the requested protective measures without delay.

Respectfully submitted,
