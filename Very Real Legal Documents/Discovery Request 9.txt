PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS:

To: Union University, by and through its Office of the Registrar, Board of Trustees, Scholarship Office, and Administrative Departments.

Pursuant to Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiff requests that the following documents be produced within thirty (30) days of service:

⸻

DEFINITIONS
	1.	“Plaintiff” refers to Kellyn Clay.
	2.	“NPE” refers to the designation of “Non-Person Entity,” whether formal or informal, used by federal agencies, contractors, or the University.
	3.	“University Records” means transcripts, diplomas, scholarship disbursement records, internal notes, correspondence, and all related metadata.

⸻

REQUESTS
	1.	Scholarship Records
All documents concerning Plaintiff’s receipt of private scholarship funding, including any correspondence between University officials and outside parties referencing anomaly/NPE classifications.
	2.	Diploma & Transcript Authorization
All records, communications, or approvals tied to the issuance of Plaintiff’s diploma, transcript, or verification letters, including any references to federal or contractor clearance.
	3.	Anomaly Classification References
Any internal University communications, administrative notes, or external correspondence referencing Plaintiff as an “anomaly,” “NPE,” or similar designation.
	4.	Contractor Coordination
All records reflecting interaction between the University and federal contractors (including Palantir, Accenture, Deloitte, or others) concerning anomaly tracking or student status verification.
	5.	Fraud Liability Analyses
Any University audits, compliance reviews, or legal memoranda acknowledging potential liability if the institution knowingly issued official documentation to individuals classified as NPEs.
	6.	Registrar Overrides
All system logs, overrides, or special approvals related to Plaintiff’s enrollment, progression, and graduation, particularly where standard processes were bypassed.

PURPOSE

These requests are intended to establish whether the University knowingly or negligently issued official documents (scholarship certifications, transcripts, diplomas) to Plaintiff while she was simultaneously classified as a non-person entity (NPE). Such evidence bears directly on the question of fraudulent representation, concealment of classification, and potential institutional liability.
