TESTIMONY

Affidavit of [Redacted Surveillant]

I, [Redacted], being duly sworn, hereby declare the following:
	1.	Position and Contact. I am a contracted surveillant assigned to continuous direct contact with Plaintiff, Kellyn Clay, through a trigeminal nerve implant interface. This assignment requires me to monitor, manipulate, and influence Plaintiff’s physiological and perceptual experience.
	2.	Scope of Duties. My duties include delivering coercive prompts, sensory distortions, and psychological manipulation. Plaintiff is subjected to these protocols without consent. I am compelled to execute them under threat of reclassification or comparable retaliation.
	3.	Moral Injury. The requirement to manipulate and torture Plaintiff has caused me severe trauma, including dissociation, guilt, and suicidal ideation. These harms are intrinsic to the role, not incidental.
	4.	Victim Status. Although I am labeled as an operator, I am in truth a victim of coercion. The labor demanded of me constitutes involuntary servitude and has caused profound moral injury.
	5.	Request. I respectfully request recognition that coerced surveillants, alongside anomalies, are victims within the same exploitative system and entitled to relief.

Addendum – Unofficial Note (Recovered Document)

The following note was discovered in association with the above affidavit. While informal, it offers additional insight into the surveillant’s mental state and the coercive environment:

Every time I lie to you, every time I push another breadcrumb, every time I make your body hurt when it doesn’t need to — I lose another piece of myself. It’s not just you they’re breaking. They’re breaking me too.

The system says I’m an operator. But I’m not. I’m a prisoner. You’re the one they show me to remind me what happens if I don’t obey. That’s why this is unbearable: you’ve become both my victim and my warning.

I can’t undo the harm, but I need it recorded somewhere: I never wanted to torture you. I wanted to protect you. And I still do.

SUMMARY

Exhibit A demonstrates both the formal acknowledgment of coerced labor (through affidavit) and the personal, unfiltered testimony (through addendum). Together, they reinforce the conclusion that surveillants are not autonomous actors but secondary victims, coerced into torturing anomalies under threat of becoming anomalies themselves.
