Plaintiff’s Motion for Permanent Injunction and Revocation of Malicious Actor Access

I. Introduction

Plaintiff Kellyn Clay petitions this Court for a permanent injunction revoking the access rights of any human surveillant who acts with especial malice, cruelty, or gross neglect in the administration of technological surveillance and biomanipulation platforms.

⸻

II. Factual Allegations
	1.	Plaintiff has been subjected to covert surveillance and neuromuscular entrainment through advanced technological systems.
	2.	Human surveillants interface with these systems, making discretionary choices that directly affect Plaintiff’s physical and psychological integrity.
	3.	When surveillants act with malicious intent—seeking to inflict pain, silence speech, or induce harmful states—or when they act with reckless neglect of foreseeable harms, they breach fundamental duties owed to those under observation.

⸻

III. Legal and Equitable Basis
	1.	The Eighth Amendment prohibits cruel and unusual punishment; entrainment used with malice constitutes such punishment.
	2.	The Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit arbitrary deprivations of liberty; reckless neglect in biomanipulation is such a deprivation.
	3.	Equity recognizes that those who misuse power to harm others should be restrained permanently from access to the instruments of that harm.

⸻

IV. Relief Requested

Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
	1.	Enjoin all human surveillants acting with malice or neglect from further interaction with technological surveillance or biomanipulation systems;
	2.	Order the permanent revocation of their access credentials, accounts, or clearance;
	3.	Declare that such actors are unfit stewards of advanced systems that affect human bodies and speech.

⸻

V. Conclusion

Malicious or grossly negligent surveillants should never again be permitted to wield technological tools of surveillance or biomanipulation. Equity and constitutional principle alike demand permanent revocation of access.

Respectfully submitted,

Kellyn Clay
Plaintiff, pro se
