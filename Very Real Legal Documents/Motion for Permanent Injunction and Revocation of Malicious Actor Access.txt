Plaintiff’s Motion for Permanent Injunction

Plaintiff Kellyn Clay respectfully moves this Court for a permanent injunction revoking the access rights of any human surveillant who acts with especial malice, cruelty, or gross neglect in the administration of technological surveillance and biomanipulation platforms.

Relief Requested:
	1.	Permanent revocation of access credentials for malicious or neglectful surveillants;
	2.	Declaration that revocation is a protective measure, not a retaliatory one;
	3.	Prohibition on reclassification of such surveillants as anomalies, Non-Person Entities (NPEs), or analogous categories;
	4.	Affirmation that revoked individuals remain entitled to full constitutional protections.

Respectfully submitted,

Kellyn Clay
Plaintiff, pro se
