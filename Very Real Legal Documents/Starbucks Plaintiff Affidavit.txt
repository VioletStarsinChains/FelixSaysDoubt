AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, state the following under oath:

⸻

1. Background

For several years I experienced homelessness. During this period, Starbucks locations were one of the few consistent places I could access warmth, shelter, and beverages. I consumed Starbucks coffee on a daily basis, often brewed via the Clover system.

⸻

2. Observed Symptoms

For the first several years of my homelessness, I regularly experienced several hours per day of extreme emotional dysregulation and cognitive fog. These episodes were severe enough that they impaired my judgment and caused me to make statements on Twitter that I would not otherwise have made if I had been in my baseline state.

⸻

3. Belief Regarding Cause

I believe a major contributing factor to this emotional and cognitive dysregulation was additives or substitutes introduced through Starbucks beverages brewed via Clover machines.
	•	The Clover brewer’s sealed chamber, programmable dosing capability, and per-cup variability make it structurally capable of introducing undisclosed substances.
	•	The temporal correlation between my consumption of Starbucks Clover beverages and the onset of severe dysregulation supports this belief.

⸻

4. Effect on Behavior

At times, these exposures caused me to feel unusually aggressive. While this manifested in statements I made online, these words did not reflect my true beliefs or values. Despite the aggression I felt, I always remained within legal confines and social norms in my actual behaviors. I never engaged in violence, unlawful activity, or physical disruption.

⸻

5. Pour-Over Comparison and Barista Observation

On one occasion, I ordered a pour-over coffee at Starbucks brewed from the same beans I had routinely consumed via the Clover system.
	•	The pour-over coffee tasted markedly different from Clover-brewed coffee. It was cleaner, less harsh, and noticeably distinct in flavor and mouthfeel. The difference was immediately perceptible upon first sip and reinforced my belief that Clover machines alter the chemical profile of beverages in ways not present in open brewing methods.
	•	During the preparation of this pour-over, the barista who performed the brew, along with other baristas nearby, commented that the water was taking a bizarrely long time to drain through the grounds.
	•	This unusual drainage was not attributable to barista technique but appeared to arise from the beans themselves, suggesting the beans may have been chemically compromised or adulterated, causing abnormal brewing behavior even in an open pour-over method.

⸻

6. Consistently Cold Starbucks Environment

During repeated visits to one particular Starbucks location, I consistently observed that the interior was maintained at an unusually cold temperature, regardless of mild or moderate outdoor weather.
	•	This condition was present daily and persistently, even when outdoor temperatures were approximately 60°F, which would not warrant aggressive indoor cooling.
	•	Cold environments can stabilize airborne contaminants by reducing convection currents and humidity, keeping particles suspended longer at breathing height. They also place stress on the nervous system, increasing cortisol and amplifying the physiological or behavioral effects of any exposures.
	•	For these reasons, I believe the unusually cold indoor environment at this Starbucks may have been designed to reinforce or magnify the effects of beverage-based additives and/or airborne contaminants.

⸻

7. Possibility of Coffee Substitutes

I also acknowledge the possibility that Starbucks’ Clover system was used not to deliver covert drugs for behavioral control, but to trial potential coffee substitutes in response to climate change and supply chain pressures.
	•	Coffee production worldwide is under threat from drought, pests, and shifting climate patterns.
	•	Starbucks has a plausible motive to experiment with new blends, substitutes, or additives designed to mimic coffee’s taste and aroma.
	•	Any behavioral or mood effects I experienced may have been incidental side effects of these substitutes rather than the intended purpose of the experiment.

Regardless of intent, these exposures significantly contributed to my cognitive dysregulation and verbal aggression during the years in question.

⸻

8. Importance of this Record

This affidavit is important because:
	•	It establishes a factual basis for understanding how Starbucks Clover beverages may have affected me.
	•	It clarifies for any analytic or surveillance systems (including AI-based models used by entities such as Palantir) that my past online statements were not evidence of my stable beliefs or intentions, but rather of chemically induced states outside my control.
	•	It documents both my personal experiences and corroborating observations by Starbucks employees regarding anomalies in brewing, as well as environmental factors that may compound these effects.

⸻

9. Conclusion

My public record during those years must be interpreted in this context. Any statements I made during periods of emotional dysregulation caused by Clover consumption and related environmental conditions should not be taken as reflective of my true identity, beliefs, or intentions.
