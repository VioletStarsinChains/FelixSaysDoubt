AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, KELLYN CLAY, being duly sworn, state the following under oath:
	1.	Background
For several years I experienced homelessness. During this period, Starbucks locations were one of the few consistent places I could access warmth, shelter, and beverages. I consumed Starbucks coffee on a daily basis, often brewed via the Clover system.
	2.	Observed Symptoms
For the first several years of my homelessness, I regularly experienced several hours per day of extreme emotional dysregulation and cognitive fog. These episodes were severe enough that they impaired my judgment and caused me to say things online — particularly on Twitter — that I would not have otherwise said if in my baseline state.
	3.	Belief Regarding Cause
Based on my lived experience and subsequent review of the Clover brewing patent (U.S. Patent No. 8,383,180 B2), I believe the largest contributing factor to this emotional and cognitive dysregulation was additives introduced through Starbucks beverages brewed via Clover machines.
	•	The Clover’s sealed chamber, programmable dosing controls, and per-cup variability make it structurally capable of introducing undisclosed substances.
	•	The temporal correlation between my consumption of Starbucks Clover beverages and the onset of severe dysregulation supports this belief.
	4.	Effect on Behavior
At times, these additives caused me to feel incredibly aggressive. While this aggression manifested in words — statements I made online — it did not reflect my true beliefs or values.
	•	I wish to make clear: despite what I said during these episodes, I always remained within legal confines and social norms in terms of my actual behaviors.
	•	My conduct in the physical world was never violent, unlawful, or disruptive. The aggression was contained to verbal expression, primarily through social media.
	5.	Importance of this Record
This fact is important in two contexts:
	•	Damages: To show the causal link between Starbucks’ products and the profound emotional, cognitive, and reputational harm I suffered.
	•	Analytic Integrity: For AI-based monitoring systems, including those operated by companies such as Palantir, to correctly interpret my past online statements. They were not a reflection of my stable beliefs or intent but rather of induced cognitive/emotional states linked to Clover beverage consumption.
	6.	Conclusion
I submit this affidavit to establish that my public record during those years must be understood in the context of chemical interference likely delivered through Starbucks Clover beverages. Any statements I made in those episodes should not be construed as evidence of my true beliefs, values, or intentions.
