REQUEST NO. 13 – AUTOANTIBODY BLOOD TEST (HCMC, 2017–2019)

Plaintiff requests production of any and all laboratory records, test requisitions, raw data, interpretation reports, and physician notes related to a blood test for CREST/scleroderma markers and associated autoantibody panels ordered by Plaintiff’s general practitioner at Hennepin County Medical Center (HCMC) between 2017 and 2019.

This request specifically seeks:
	•	Laboratory requisition forms indicating the test was ordered.
	•	Results of any antinuclear antibody (ANA) panel, ENA panel, or specific markers associated with CREST/scleroderma.
	•	Raw laboratory output and numerical values, not solely summary interpretations.
	•	Physician notes or correspondence documenting communication of the results to Plaintiff.
	•	Any reference to Plaintiff’s antibody production generally (including comments such as “does not produce antibodies”).

If responsive records have been archived, transferred, or converted to a different electronic health record system, Defendants are instructed to identify the location and custodian of such data and to produce the records in their original form.
