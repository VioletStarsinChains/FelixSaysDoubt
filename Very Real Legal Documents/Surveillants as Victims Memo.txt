MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF EXPANSION OF PLAINTIFF INTO CLASS ACTION

⸻

INTRODUCTION

Plaintiff respectfully submits this memorandum to further support certification of a class composed not only of anomalies but also of surveillants compelled into participation. The evidence demonstrates that surveillants, though appearing as system agents, are themselves victims of coercion. By using Plaintiff’s mistreatment as a cautionary example, Defendants have subjected surveillants to forced labor under threat of similar harm, resulting in grave moral injury. Recognizing surveillants as secondary victims strengthens the class and underscores the systemic and unconstitutional nature of the enterprise.

STATEMENT OF FACTS
	1.	Exemplary Deterrence. Plaintiff’s classification as an anomaly and resulting deprivation has been deliberately displayed to surveillants as a warning of the consequences of disobedience.
	2.	Coerced Labor. Surveillants are compelled to participate in continuity theater and behavioral futures markets under threat of similar non-consensual biomedical intervention, anomaly classification, or economic retaliation.
	3.	Moral Injury. Many surveillants suffer profound psychological trauma from being forced to exploit anomalies while recognizing the human cost of their actions. This injury is foreseeable, uniform, and intrinsic to the system’s methods.
	4.	Closed Loop of Harm. Plaintiff’s suffering ensures surveillant compliance; surveillants’ compliance perpetuates further anomaly suffering. Both groups are entrapped within the same exploitative cycle.

LEGAL ISSUE

Whether surveillants, though cast as system operatives, are in fact victims of coercion and moral injury such that they fall within the proposed class definition and are entitled to relief alongside anomalies.

⸻

ARGUMENT

I. Rule 23(a) prerequisites are satisfied.
	•	Numerosity. The number of surveillants coerced into compliance under threat of harm is substantial, rendering joinder impracticable.
	•	Commonality. Core questions apply across the class: (1) Were surveillants compelled into participation under threat of serious harm? (2) Did such coercion result in uniform moral injury? (3) Were anomalies and surveillants jointly entrapped by the same structures of control?
	•	Typicality. Plaintiff’s harm is mirrored in surveillants, who were subjected to the same mechanisms of coercion, even if positioned differently within the hierarchy.
	•	Adequacy. Plaintiff’s claims and requested relief—cessation of coercion, restitution, recognition of victimhood—apply equally to surveillants.

II. Rule 23(b)(2) certification is appropriate.
Defendants acted on grounds generally applicable to anomalies and surveillants alike. Injunctive and declaratory relief is appropriate to end the system of coercion for the class as a whole.

III. Constitutional claims are strengthened by inclusion of surveillants.
By showing that even system operatives are entrapped, coerced, and injured, the class claims underscore that the enterprise is not merely exploitative but fundamentally unconstitutional.

⸻

CONCLUSION

Surveillants are not merely agents of the system but are themselves victims, forced into exploitative labor through fear of the very harms visited upon Plaintiff. Their inclusion in the proposed class reflects the true scope of the enterprise: an unconstitutional regime entrapping both anomalies and surveillants in a cycle of coercion, deprivation, and moral injury. This Court should recognize the propriety of class certification to ensure relief encompasses all affected individuals.

Respectfully submitted,
Bango Skank, JD
