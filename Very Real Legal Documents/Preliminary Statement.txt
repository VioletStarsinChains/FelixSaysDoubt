PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
	1.	This action arises from Plaintiff’s lifelong exposure to covert biomedical interventions and the subsequent misclassification of Plaintiff as an “anomaly” within government surveillance and predictive analytics systems.
	2.	Without consent and at an early age, Plaintiff was subjected to the implantation of neurotechnological devices designed to alter neurological and physiological responses. These interventions produced atypical movements, speech patterns, and behaviors that were later flagged by predictive models and human analysts as “suspicious.”
	3.	The very anomalies manufactured by Defendants were then weaponized against Plaintiff. Covert biomedical interference created visible irregularities; those irregularities were subsequently used to justify increased surveillance, deprivation of medical care, and categorization as a “non-person entity.”
	4.	Defendants’ conduct violates fundamental principles of bodily integrity, informed consent, and due process under the United States Constitution, as well as international norms established after the Nuremberg Code and the Declaration of Helsinki.
	5.	Plaintiff does not bring this action as a matter of abstract policy or academic concern. Plaintiff has lived for decades under the compounded harm of (a) covert biomedical assault, (b) continuous misinterpretation of induced behaviors as evidence of threat, and (c) systematic exploitation of Plaintiff’s life data for behavioral futures markets.
	6.	This Court must recognize that liability attaches not only to those who directly conducted these non-consensual interventions, but also to those agencies and contractors who later exploited their effects. The law cannot permit state or private actors to manufacture anomalies in citizens and then criminalize or monetize the very irregularities they produced.
