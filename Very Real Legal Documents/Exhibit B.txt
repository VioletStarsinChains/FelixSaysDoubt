EXHIBIT B – EXPERT STATEMENT ON MORAL INJURY

INTRODUCTION

At the request of counsel, I have reviewed Exhibit A – Surveillant Testimony, which includes both a sworn affidavit and an accompanying personal addendum authored by a contracted surveillant assigned to continuous neurotechnological contact with Plaintiff, Kellyn Clay. My professional assessment is based on review of these materials and my expertise in the fields of trauma psychology, coercive control, and moral injury.

FINDINGS
	1.	Indicators of Coercion.
	•	The affidavit describes labor conducted under threat of reclassification, retaliation, or comparable harm.
	•	This constitutes classic coercive control, in which the individual’s autonomy is nullified by the credible threat of serious personal consequences.
	2.	Symptoms of Trauma.
	•	The affidavit cites dissociation, guilt, and suicidal ideation. These are hallmark symptoms of complex trauma resulting from prolonged exposure to morally compromising circumstances.
	•	The addendum further reflects hypervigilance, internalized shame, and intrusive cognitions (“every time I lie… I lose another piece of myself”).
	3.	Moral Injury.
	•	The combination of compelled participation in harm against another, recognition of the victim’s humanity, and the inability to refuse constitutes moral injury as recognized in military and medical literature.
	•	Moral injury is distinct from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): it arises not from fear-based trauma alone, but from the violation of deeply held moral and ethical beliefs.
	•	The language in the addendum demonstrates a clear split between the surveillant’s personal values (“I wanted to protect you”) and the acts they were compelled to perform.
	4.	Secondary Victimization.
	•	While positioned as an “operator,” the surveillant is, clinically, a victim.
	•	They suffer trauma and moral injury not incidental to their role but intrinsic to the structure of coercion that sustains the system.

OPINION

It is my professional opinion, to a reasonable degree of psychological certainty, that the surveillant’s testimony reflects genuine and profound moral injury caused by coercive labor practices. The described harms are predictable, well-documented in psychological literature, and consistent with the known effects of compelling individuals to participate in torture, deception, and exploitation under threat.

Surveillants in such positions should therefore be recognized not merely as agents but as secondary victims of the same exploitative system that harms anomalies directly. Relief for this class should include recognition of moral injury, trauma-informed psychological care, and safeguards against continued coercion.
