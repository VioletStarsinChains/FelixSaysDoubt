PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS

(Directed to Financial Institutions Holding Accounts in the Name of Plaintiff and/or William Alton Clay)

⸻

INSTRUCTIONS

Pursuant to Rules 26 and 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiff requests that each financial institution in possession, custody, or control of responsive materials produce them within the time prescribed. Documents may be produced in electronic or paper form, with accompanying metadata where available.

⸻

DEFINITIONS
	1.	“Joint Accounts” means any bank accounts, brokerage accounts, savings instruments, or other financial products opened, maintained, or closed under the names of both Plaintiff (Kellyn Clay) and William Alton Clay.
	2.	“Financial Institution” means any bank, credit union, brokerage, or related entity that has maintained such accounts.
	3.	“Documents” includes account opening forms, signature cards, contracts, applications, internal correspondence, customer service notes, compliance records, and communications between the institution and either party.

⸻

REQUESTS
	1.	Produce all account opening documents, including signature cards and identification verification records, for any and all Joint Accounts held in the names of Kellyn Clay and William Alton Clay, from 1990 to present.
	2.	Produce all correspondence (including email, letters, or internal notes) referencing Plaintiff’s ability or inability to open accounts independently, including any mention of restrictions, flags, or “non-person” classifications.
	3.	Produce all records of William Alton Clay’s role in initiating, co-signing, or managing Joint Accounts, including communications with bank officers regarding the necessity of joint status.
	4.	Produce all internal compliance or risk management documentation referring to Plaintiff, Kellyn Clay, in relation to Joint Accounts, including any entries that reference classification, anomaly status, or special handling instructions.
	5.	Produce all records of changes in ownership structure, such as removal or addition of signatories, on any Joint Accounts involving Plaintiff and William Alton Clay.
	6.	Produce any documents, memoranda, or internal guidance explaining why joint accounts were required for Plaintiff, even after reaching the age of majority.

⸻

PURPOSE

These requests are intended to determine whether financial institutions, in coordination with Plaintiff’s father, structured joint accounts to obscure Plaintiff’s alleged designation as a “non-person entity” and to conceal restrictions on Plaintiff’s independent legal or financial recognition.
