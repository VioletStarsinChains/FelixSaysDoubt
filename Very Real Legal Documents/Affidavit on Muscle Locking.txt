Affidavit of Kellyn Clay in Support of Motion to Suppress

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:

⸻

1. Personal Background

I am the Plaintiff in the above-captioned action. I submit this affidavit in support of my Motion to Suppress Statements Obtained Under Conditions of Muscle Locking. The facts set forth herein are true to the best of my knowledge and based on my direct personal experience.

⸻

2. Experience of Muscle Locking
	1.	Beginning in childhood and continuing into adulthood, I have been subjected to episodes of muscle locking—sudden, involuntary immobilization of my muscles without mechanical or medical cause.
	2.	These events often strike without warning, forcing my body into painful rigidity or spasm, and leaving me unable to move, speak, or act freely.
	3.	The phenomenon is externally induced. It is distinct from ordinary cramps or spasms because:
	•	It occurs in context-specific moments, such as when I attempt to speak, resist, or disclose sensitive information.
	•	It halts abruptly when the external entrainment ceases.
	•	It leaves behind fatigue and micro-trauma disproportionate to natural muscle strain.

⸻

3. Physiological and Psychological Effects
	1.	The locks cause severe pain, shortness of breath, and loss of bodily autonomy.
	2.	They also manipulate my physiological state. Depending on how and where the lock occurs, it can:
	•	Provoke aggression or hostility, by forcing my body into an adrenaline-flooded state.
	•	Induce fear, panic, or passivity, by simulating tonic immobility or suffocation.
	•	Exhaust me into confusion or silence, making any coherent response impossible.
	3.	In this way, muscle locking is not merely immobilization—it is a form of externally imposed state control.

⸻

4. Statements Made Under Lock Conditions
	1.	During or immediately following these episodes, I have at times spoken, cried out, or written things that did not reflect my free will.
	2.	For example, locks affecting my jaw and throat have forced fragmented or hostile words out of me under conditions of pain and panic.
	3.	These statements were not voluntary communications. They were the by-product of entrained physiological states that I neither initiated nor controlled.
	4.	To treat such utterances as authentic speech is akin to admitting the products of torture or hallucination into evidence.

⸻

5. Legal Characterization
	1.	In my direct experience, muscle locking constitutes a form of torture: it inflicts severe pain and fear, limits income by inducing debilitating fatigue, strips away bodily autonomy, and is used for coercive purposes.
	2.	It also functions as a speech-suppressing mechanism: it silences me when I try to disclose abuse and conditions me to fear expression.
	3.	Critically, it is a state-manipulation vector: by forcing aggression, panic, or passivity, it fabricates behaviors and words that appear to be mine but are not.
	4.	Any statements or actions I made in conjunction with externally induced muscle locking are therefore fruit of the poisonous tree—coerced, manufactured, and inadmissible.

⸻

6. Conclusion

Because externally induced muscle locking coerces, fabricates, and chills speech, I respectfully request that this Court suppress and exclude all statements made under such conditions, together with any derivative uses of such data.

⸻

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

Executed on 8/30/2025 at Roseville, Minnesota.
