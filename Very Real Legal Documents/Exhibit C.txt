PURPOSE

This Exhibit accompanies Exhibit B – Expert Statement on Moral Injury and outlines proposed remedies appropriate to address the harm experienced by surveillants who were coerced into direct manipulation, deception, and torture of anomalies, including Plaintiff Kellyn Clay.

⸻

RECOMMENDED REMEDIES
	1.	Recognition of Victim Status.
	•	Formal acknowledgment that surveillants conscripted into these roles are not perpetrators alone but secondary victims of coercion.
	•	Expungement of records portraying them as voluntary actors or agents of control.
	2.	Protected Disclosures.
	•	Establishment of confidential and legally protected channels for surveillants to disclose their roles and experiences without risk of retaliation or reclassification.
	•	Whistleblower-style protections to encourage truth-telling and reconciliation.
	3.	Trauma-Informed Psychological Care.
	•	Access to clinicians trained in moral injury, complex trauma, and coercive control dynamics.
	•	Care models should address guilt, shame, dissociation, and suicidality as predictable outcomes of coerced participation.
	4.	Restitution and Compensation.
	•	Monetary restitution for labor performed under coercion, in line with legal precedents on involuntary servitude.
	•	Compensation for loss of autonomy, diminished employability, and long-term health consequences.
	5.	Rehabilitation Pathways.
	•	Development of structured programs that allow former surveillants to transition into constructive, non-coercive roles.
	•	Community reintegration initiatives emphasizing restorative justice principles, ensuring that those harmed by coercion may also contribute to repair.
	6.	Ongoing Monitoring and Safeguards.
	•	Appointment of independent monitors to ensure cessation of coercive practices.
	•	Periodic judicial review of compliance with injunctions to prevent reimposition of exploitative labor conditions.

⸻

CONCLUSION

The harms suffered by surveillants are not incidental but systemic, arising directly from Defendants’ use of anomaly exploitation as a coercive tool. Remediation must therefore be systemic as well, ensuring recognition, restitution, psychological care, and protected pathways out of coercion.
