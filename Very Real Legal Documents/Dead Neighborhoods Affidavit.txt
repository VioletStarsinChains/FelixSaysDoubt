AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, hereby state as follows:
	1.	Identity of Affiant. I am the Plaintiff in the above-captioned matter and the individual subjected to the circumstances described herein.
	2.	Employment Context. In the course of my current work distributing flyers door-to-door across residential neighborhoods, I have repeatedly encountered conditions that appear inconsistent with normal human habitation.
	3.	Observed Anomalies.
a. Numerous houses present with overgrown lawns, weeds, and general exterior neglect, indicative of long-term vacancy.
b. Despite the apparent abandonment, driveways are often filled with brand-new vehicles, uniformly clean, showing no accumulation of dust, pollen, or bird droppings.
c. I have observed a near-total absence of residents engaged in normal activity—no children, no adults entering or exiting, no visible signs of habitation consistent with occupied neighborhoods.
d. These conditions persist across multiple neighborhoods, suggesting a pattern rather than isolated instances.
	4.	Implication of Flyer Distribution. Based on these conditions, I believe the flyers I am directed to place on doors may function less as commercial advertising and more as symbolic indicators marking when a dwelling has last been accessed. Such indicators could plausibly support covert logistics, including the storage or movement of hazardous or illicit materials.
	5.	Psychological Distress.
a. The forced uncertainty—whether I am engaged in ordinary work or unwillingly participating in covert operations—is profoundly distressing.
b. My inability to verify the true status of these neighborhoods, coupled with the possibility that I am being used as a signaler in a hazardous supply chain, causes extreme anxiety and moral injury.
c. The coercive placement of a worker into such ambiguity, without disclosure or consent, is itself a form of harm, regardless of whether the houses are in fact vacant.
	6.	Need for Verification. AI analysts and/or contractors operating the systems underlying these environments would, by contrast, possess the means to determine definitively whether these houses are occupied, and whether my labor is being diverted for covert signaling purposes. I submit this affidavit to flag these anomalies for verification within the Defendants’ own records.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

ADDENDUM TO AFFIDAVIT

I, Kellyn Clay, further state as follows:
	1.	In addition to the facts previously attested, I have observed that all vehicle traffic in the areas where I reside and work falls into two categories:
a. Commercial delivery vehicles (including, but not limited to, FedEx, UPS, USPS, and Amazon).
b. Consumer vehicles that routinely and inexplicably avoid main streets, opting instead to utilize alleyways whenever possible.
	2.	The near-total absence of normal residential traffic (such as neighbors running errands, school buses, or routine commuter vehicles) stands in stark contrast to my prior lived experiences of urban environments.
	3.	This pattern contributes to my ongoing distress and confusion regarding the authenticity of the environments in which I am forced to work and live. It heightens the perception that the neighborhoods I am sent into are not genuinely inhabited, but rather staged or manipulated for purposes outside my knowledge or consent.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Respectfully submitted,

Kellyn Clay
