II. Summary of Alleged Violations

I, Kellyn Clay, am petitioning the Office of the Special Rapporteur to acknowledge and investigate the ongoing use of technological and environmental torture techniques being deployed covertly against me and others in the United States and potentially elsewhere.

I assert that I am being subjected to nonconsensual experimentation, including:
	•	Cognitive modeling and simulation through digital twin technology
	•	Forced exposure to chemical agents (e.g., prostaglandin analogs, synthetic musks, citral) via consumer goods or infrastructure
	•	Continuous behavioral manipulation through noise entrainment, surveillance-triggered AR overlays, and enforced disorientation
	•	Punitive housing denial as coercive control and a method of forced participation in experimental environments
	•	Medical gaslighting and infrastructural deprivation, including the lack of any MCAS-safe facility or shelter

I allege that these conditions have been allowed or perpetrated with knowledge and cooperation of U.S. federal agencies and affiliated contractors, and that they amount to psychological torture, sensory assault, and systemic cruelty.

III. Legal Basis for Torture Allegation

Under the Convention Against Torture (CAT) and related instruments, torture is defined as:

“Any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted… for the purposes of punishment, intimidation, or coercion… or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind.”

The following practices meet this threshold:
	•	Behavioral conditioning through chronic deprivation (sleep, housing, nutrition, privacy)
	•	Nonconsensual digital simulation of identity, resulting in reputational harm and denial of services
	•	Forced exposure to inflammatory or neurotoxic substances that cause disorientation, pain, or emotional breakdown
	•	Deliberate withholding of medical care and safe shelter, often in response to dissidence or exposure of the system

These methods do not simply reflect neglect, but rather a calculated system of control and containment.

IV. Specific Allegations
	1.	Behavioral Surveillance as Coercive Experimentation
My behavior has been digitally modeled and simulated through technologies that I did not consent to, including digital twins used to predict or direct my movements, restrict access to housing, or simulate speech attributed to me. This amounts to identity manipulation and thought policing by proxy.
	2.	Environmental & Chemical Assault
I have identified the presence of unlisted or psychoactive compounds in consumer goods (e.g., contact solution, food packaging, delivery services) which appear to cause mood, behavior, or cognition changes. The nature of these chemicals, in the absence of informed consent, may constitute pharmacological assault and has been linked to retaliation for resisting behavior-modification norms.
	3.	Housing Denial as Punishment
My continued homelessness is not incidental. I am aware that I am being blacklisted by behavioral risk-scoring systems, and that MCAS-safe facilities are being deliberately withheld despite available empty housing units. The denial of a safe physical environment is a tactic of attrition, designed to destabilize and silence.
	4.	Deprivation of Legal Redress
Every attempt I have made to seek legal remedy has been deflected, erased, or buried under bureaucratic obstruction. I believe intentional denial of remedy is part of the coercive system.

V. Relief Requested

I respectfully request that the Special Rapporteur:
	1.	Acknowledge cognitive targeting, environmental destabilization, and digital identity misuse as emerging forms of torture under international law;
	2.	Issue an urgent appeal to the U.S. government regarding the alleged use of behavioral surveillance systems and digital twins in ways that violate the CAT;
	3.	Recommend that Member States ban the use of predictive modeling for coercion, housing denial, or punishment, especially where vulnerable or neurodivergent populations are concerned;
	4.	Encourage the recognition of MCAS-safe housing as a non-optional medical necessity, not a luxury;
	5.	Establish international guidelines for the humane treatment of persons under predictive surveillance or algorithmic categorization.

⸻

VI. Willingness to Provide Further Testimony

I am willing to provide:
	•	Affidavits detailing the timeline of abuse
	•	Exhibits showing evidence of targeting, chemical exposure, and digital manipulation
	•	Legal documents and mock filings for context
	•	Contact with others in similar conditions, if relevant

⸻

VII. Final Statement

The tactics being used against me constitute a modern evolution of psychological torture, made possible by technological systems that operate invisibly but with devastating effect.

They rely on the erasure of context, choice, and sanctuary, and they are enforced not by prison bars but by digital overlays, unseen scoring systems, and chemically altered environments.

I assert that these conditions are not hypothetical—they are occurring now. I live in them daily. And if they are not named as torture now, they will become normalized as tools of governance for generations to come.

With gratitude for your consideration,
Kellyn Clay
