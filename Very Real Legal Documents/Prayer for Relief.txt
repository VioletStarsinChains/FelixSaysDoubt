PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court enter judgment in Plaintiff’s favor and against Defendants, and grant the following relief:
	1.	Declaration of Rights. A judicial declaration that Defendants’ conduct in subjecting Plaintiff to non-consensual biomedical intervention, surveillance classification, and data exploitation violated Plaintiff’s constitutional rights, statutory protections, and rights under international law.
	2.	Injunctive Relief. A permanent injunction prohibiting Defendants, their agents, contractors, successors, and assigns from:
a. engaging in any further biomedical experimentation or implantation on Plaintiff without informed consent;
b. classifying or labeling Plaintiff as an “anomaly,” “non-person entity,” or equivalent designation in surveillance or predictive analytics systems;
c. monetizing, transmitting, or otherwise exploiting Plaintiff’s behavioral or biometric data.
	3.	Expungement. An order requiring Defendants to expunge and permanently destroy all records, designations, or data files that classify Plaintiff as an anomaly or otherwise stigmatize Plaintiff based on behaviors induced by covert biomedical interventions.
	4.	Damages. An award of compensatory damages in an amount to be determined at trial, together with punitive damages sufficient to deter future unlawful conduct of this nature.
	5.	Attorneys’ Fees and Costs. An award of reasonable attorneys’ fees, expert fees, and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988 and any other applicable authority.
    6.  An order requiring Defendants, directly or through appropriate federal or state agencies, to provide Plaintiff with safe, stable, and long-term housing as a form of equitable relief, recognizing that deprivation of housing is the most immediate and ongoing harm caused by Defendants’ conduct.
	7.	Further Relief. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
Bango Skank, JD
