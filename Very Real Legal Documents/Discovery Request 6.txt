PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION

REQUEST NO. 14 – MODERNA COVID-19 VACCINATION RECORDS (2021–2022)

Plaintiff requests production of any and all records, files, communications, and data concerning the administration of two doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine received by Plaintiff between January 1, 2021, and January 31, 2022.

This request specifically includes:
	•	Vaccination administration records, including date, time, lot number, and provider of each dose.
	•	Informed consent forms, screening questionnaires, or intake documentation.
	•	Billing, insurance, or reimbursement codes linked to the administration of the vaccine.
	•	Any adverse event reports, post-vaccination monitoring notes, or follow-up communications.
	•	Any internal or external correspondence referencing Plaintiff’s vaccination, including reporting to state immunization registries (MIIC or equivalent).
	•	Laboratory or surveillance data, if any, collected in association with or subsequent to the vaccine doses.

Defendants are further instructed to identify whether any records were transmitted to state, federal, or third-party entities beyond routine immunization reporting.

PURPOSE

These requests are intended to ensure Plaintiff has access to the complete record of their Moderna COVID-19 vaccinations in order to:
	1.	Independently evaluate the medical circumstances surrounding an intervention that resulted in severe adverse effects and nearly caused Plaintiff’s death.
	2.	Determine whether vaccine administration records were altered, withheld, or transmitted without consent to state, federal, or third-party entities.
	3.	Assess whether vaccination status or associated data was used as a pretext for custodial action against Plaintiff or to engineer Plaintiff's homelessness.
	4.	Establish a comprehensive evidentiary foundation for evaluating the intersection of biomedical interventions, adverse outcomes, and subsequent deprivation of liberty.
