Opinion and Order

Before the Court is Plaintiff’s Motion for Permanent Injunction Barring the Categorization of Any Human Person as a Non-Person Entity (NPE).

I. Findings of Fact
	1.	Evidence presented indicates that Defendants and affiliated contractors have developed or utilized systems that categorize certain human beings as “Non-Person Entities” (NPEs) or anomalies.
	2.	Such designations operate to deny individuals recognition as legal persons, stripping them of constitutional protections and facilitating covert experimentation, surveillance, and coercive manipulation.
	3.	The practice has been applied or contemplated with respect to both the living and the deceased, threatening the integrity of constitutional rights across generations.

II. Conclusions of Law
	1.	The Constitution guarantees due process and equal protection to all persons. Fifth Amendment; Fourteenth Amendment.
	2.	The term “person” is not subject to arbitrary administrative limitation. Any governmental or contractor classification that nullifies personhood is unconstitutional on its face.
	3.	Categorization of any human being as a Non-Person Entity (NPE) or anomaly is incompatible with the rule of law, violates the constitutional baseline of personhood, and constitutes irreparable harm.
	4.	Equity requires categorical relief: absent a permanent injunction, the risk of ongoing and future violations remains imminent.

III. Order

Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that:
	1.	Defendants, their agents, employees, and contractors are permanently enjoined from categorizing or treating any human being — living or deceased — as a Non-Person Entity (NPE), anomaly, or analogous designation;
	2.	Any such classification currently in existence is declared void ab initio;
	3.	Defendants shall promptly identify and remove all NPE or anomaly classifications applied to human persons from databases, models, or operational systems, and certify compliance to this Court;
	4.	No future surveillance, predictive, or biomanipulation platform shall employ NPE designations with respect to human persons;
	5.	Nothing in this Order shall be construed as permitting retaliatory measures against individuals whose access to such systems has been revoked for misconduct; revocation is protective, not punitive.

SO ORDERED.
