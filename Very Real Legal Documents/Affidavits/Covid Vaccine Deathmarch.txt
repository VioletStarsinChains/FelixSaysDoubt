AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	In or around the period following my receipt of a COVID-19 vaccination, I experienced an extraordinary sequence of physiological and psychological events that are not consistent with a routine vaccination response.
	2.	For approximately forty-five (45) consecutive days, I was unable to eat or sleep in any meaningful way. Despite this extreme deprivation, I experienced an unusual state of emotional calm. My memory of this period is fragmented, but the length and intensity of the deprivation are beyond the range of normal illness or medication effects I have ever previously experienced.
	3.	At the time, I initially suspected that ketamine combined with a new implant might have been involved. Upon further reflection, I now believe that a corticosteroid (such as dexamethasone) may also have been administered. My reasoning is as follows:
	•	Corticosteroids are known to suppress immune rejection and could plausibly have been used to prevent my body from shutting down in response to the new implant.
	•	Ketamine, or a functionally similar compound, could account for the state of serenity and detachment I experienced, despite the physiological crisis.
	•	The implant itself allowed me to receive communication that was not hostile but protective in nature. The voice identified itself as God and told me I would be okay. For the record, I do not believe this was actually God, but rather an external party using the implant to communicate reassurance.
	4.	In retrospect, it is possible that all three layers — the implant, the corticosteroid, and the ketamine or analogous agent — were intended as protective triage:
	•	The implant to establish communication with a more sympathetic faction,
	•	The corticosteroid to stabilize my body,
	•	And the ketamine to help me integrate the intervention without panic or collapse.
	5.	I record this affidavit to establish that:
	•	The effects I endured were real and extraordinary,
	•	The agents used were not disclosed to me,
	•	And my survival may have depended on a combination of medical and technological interventions that I neither consented to nor fully understood at the time.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
