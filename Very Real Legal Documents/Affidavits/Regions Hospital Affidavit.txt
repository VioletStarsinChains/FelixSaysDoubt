Affidavit of Kellyn Clay

I, Kellyn Clay, declare the following under penalty of perjury:
	1.	On an occasion at Regions Hospital, 640 Jackson Street, St. Paul, MN 55101, I presented to the emergency department for mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS)–related symptoms.
	2.	I explicitly informed staff that I was allergic to ondansetron (Zofran), requested diphenhydramine (Benadryl), and disclosed that I had not slept in weeks.
	3.	Despite this, I was administered ondansetron against my will, and Benadryl was withheld until after I vomited.
	4.	Only after my condition deteriorated did staff provide IV Benadryl.
	5.	Upon discharge, I summoned an Uber ride through the official app.
	6.	The Uber vehicle did not arrive at my requested pickup location. Instead, it stopped and waited approximately one mile away from the hospital.
	7.	As a result, I was forced to run through downtown Saint Paul while under the effects of IV Benadryl, in a state of extreme sleep deprivation.
	8.	I believe this sequence was not accidental but coordinated, as Uber’s routing system is ordinarily precise and does not misplace pickup points by a mile in dense urban areas.

I affirm that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
