UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

Kellyn Clay, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated,
Plaintiff,

v.

Starbucks Corporation,
Defendant

⸻ 

Affidavit — Symbolic Cup Markings

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	In the course of consuming beverages from Starbucks Corporation, I have consistently observed that baristas often draw smiley faces or other symbolic markings on to-go cups.
	2.	There are multiple distinct variations of these drawn faces, not limited to a single generic style.
	3.	Based on repeated observation and the parallel timing of physical effects, I believe these symbols may be used internally to indicate which undisclosed additives or drugs have been included in a given beverage.
	4.	I make this statement to document the recurring presence of symbolic markings and to preserve my belief that they function as covert dosing indicators rather than mere decoration.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

Executed this ___ day of __________, 2025, in _______________________.
