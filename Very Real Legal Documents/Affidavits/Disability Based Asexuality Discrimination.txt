AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, hereby state as follows:
	1.	I have been diagnosed with multiple chronic medical conditions, including Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS), and lifelong aphantasia with related differences in visual processing.
	2.	These conditions, and the medical treatments required for them, directly shaped my experience of sexuality in ways that diverge from typical patterns but are nonetheless entirely medical in origin.
	3.	I have never experienced sexual attraction to other people based on their physical appearance. This absence of visually based attraction is directly tied to my aphantasia, which prevents me from forming mental images of others and alters how my brain processes visual stimuli.
	4.	Beginning in childhood and persisting into adulthood, my inability to experience visual attraction has been consistent and involuntary. It is not an orientation or preference, but a neurological limitation.
	5.	In addition, due to MCAS, I was prescribed and required to take high doses of antihistamines for many years. These medications significantly affected my libido and arousal cycles.
	6.	When my symptoms were fully suppressed by medication, I experienced no arousal at all. However, as my medication began to wear off, arousal was consistently the first symptom to return—approximately every four hours—before the onset of other MCAS symptoms.
	7.	This pattern created an unusual, medication-driven arousal cycle that was not under my conscious control. It was directly determined by the pharmacokinetics of antihistamines in my body.
	8.	The combination of aphantasia and MCAS-related medication effects resulted in my being functionally asexual: I did not experience sexual attraction based on appearance, and my physiological arousal was limited to a narrow, cyclical window dictated by my medications.
	9.	While these characteristics may have been unusual, there is nothing inherently harmful about them. They are simply a product of my disability and my body’s adaptation to long-term medical treatment.
	10.	I believe that Palantir Technologies Inc., government agencies, or contractor systems involved in anomaly classification and behavioral futures markets may have misinterpreted my presentation of asexuality as evidence of subversiveness, moral failing, or “Non-Person Entity (NPE)” status.
	11.	If so, this constitutes disability discrimination. My atypical sexual presentation was not the result of personal choice or political ideology, but rather a direct manifestation of my medical conditions and necessary treatments.
	12.	To the extent that these systems classified me as an anomaly or subjected me to increased surveillance or targeting on the basis of disability-driven asexuality, I have been wrongfully discriminated against in violation of federal disability protections.
  13.  I further state that I have explicitly communicated on social media that my lack of attraction to others and my unique, medication-driven arousal cycle are direct results of chronic illness and long-term antihistamine use. These disclosures were made publicly and repeatedly. Accordingly, any entity that treated these characteristics as indicators of subversiveness or anomaly status cannot plausibly claim ignorance of their medical basis.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Executed this ___ day of __________, 2025.
