Affidavit of Kellyn Clay â€” Early Childhood Sexual Exposure via Sibling

I, Kellyn Clay, declare the following under penalty of perjury:
	1.	When I was a child, I observed my sister Kristin Clay (now Kristin Houser), who was approximately 8 years old at the time, using Barbies to reproduce sexual acts involving over 5 individuals simultaneously.
	2.	The behaviors she enacted with the dolls were not age-appropriate and involved knowledge that a child of her age should not reasonably have possessed.
	3.	I was under 6 years old at the time of this incident.
	4.	This exposure was deeply disturbing and confusing for me as a child.
	5.	I believe this incident indicates that my sister had been exposed to sexual knowledge or experiences prematurely, and that I was indirectly subjected to grooming through her play.
	6.	This event forms part of a broader pattern in my childhood of being deliberately exposed to inappropriate, exploitative, or conditioning material in ways that blurred boundaries, normalized abuse, and denied me healthy, age-appropriate development.

I affirm that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
