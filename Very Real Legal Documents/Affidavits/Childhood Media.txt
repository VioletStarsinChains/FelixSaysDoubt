Affidavit of Kellyn Clay — Forced Symbolic Media Exposure

I, Kellyn Clay, declare the following under penalty of perjury:
	1.	Throughout my childhood, my parents repeatedly compelled me to attend live performances of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat and to listen to the soundtrack on a frequent basis.
	2.	I was also repeatedly directed to engage with books concerning Anne Frank, including The Diary of Anne Frank.
	3.	These exposures were not voluntary. As a child, I had no capacity to choose what media or literature I engaged with. My parents exercised total control over my environment and selections.
	4.	Both Joseph and Anne Frank are depicted in narratives of slavery, captivity, and systemic oppression:
	•	Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat centers on Joseph being sold into slavery by his own family, enduring imprisonment, and surviving exploitation under authoritarian power.
	•	The Diary of Anne Frank centers on a young girl whose entire life is shaped by the attempt to enslave, confine, and exterminate her community under a totalitarian regime.
	5.	The repetition of these particular works across my childhood is suspicious in retrospect because of their thematic overlap with the very conditions of slavery, surveillance, betrayal, and attrition that I allege were being covertly applied to me.
	6.	This pattern of forced symbolic exposure indicates that my father knew exactly what was happening to me from the very beginning. By insisting on narratives of slavery and captivity, he demonstrated knowledge of the covert systems at work and his own complicity in reinforcing them.

I affirm that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
