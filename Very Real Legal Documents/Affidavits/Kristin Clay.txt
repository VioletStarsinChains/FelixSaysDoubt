AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, hereby state as follows:
	1.	In the period following my vaccine injury, my former partner requested that I grant them power of attorney over my affairs. This request was unexpected and highly concerning given my vulnerable health condition at the time.
	2.	Shortly thereafter, my estranged sister — with whom I had not spoken for many years — reappeared in my life. At this point, she had allegedly changed her last name and moved to a new house.
  3.  My sister was born Kristin Alexis Clay. After marriage, she was known as Kristin Clay Lennon. At the time of the incident described here, she was presenting herself under the name Kristin Houser, which she claimed was the result of a divorce and subsequent legal name change. I have not independently verified the legitimacy of this name change, and in light of the other irregularities described, I have reason to question whether the person I interacted with was in fact my biological sister.
	4.	The house where she claimed to be living appeared to be under construction or torn apart in a way that made it effectively uninhabitable. Despite having two young children and being an extremely health-conscious individual (she refuses to use plastic products of any kind), she was allegedly residing there. This was completely inconsistent with what I know of her values and practices.
	5.	I did not stay at that house. Instead, my “sister” arranged for and paid for me to stay at an Airbnb. I had no role in securing the reservation and therefore never knew the address. Based on Palantir’s known contracts with private companies and government entities, I have reason to believe that Airbnb maintains data-sharing agreements that could have funneled my location directly into Palantir’s systems.
	6.	During this time, this person — whom I now strongly suspect may not have been my biological sister but rather a digital twin or proxy impersonator — attempted to have me psychiatrically institutionalized on the basis that my suffering was a mental health problem rather than a physical medical crisis.
	7.	This attempt at commitment occurred despite the fact that both my medical doctor and every psychotherapist I have ever worked with have explicitly affirmed that what appear to be occasional mental health symptoms in my case are in fact a direct result of chronic immune dysregulation, not true mental illness. Each has made clear that psychiatric institutionalization is the worst possible solution for my situation, as it would not only fail to address the underlying disorder but could dramatically worsen my health.
	8.	I communicated this history and these facts clearly to my sister (or the person presenting as her). She therefore knew, or should have known, that psychiatric confinement was inappropriate, unsafe, and directly contrary to the recommendations of all of my providers.
  8.  Despite these facts, a psychiatric evaluation was performed, and the evaluators concluded that I did not require inpatient psychiatric treatment. Nevertheless, my sister (or the person presenting as her) pushed for me to be admitted anyway. On my first day in the program, I met with the program nurse to review my medications and medical needs. The nurse told me directly that I was unsafe in that facility, that I should not be there, and that the problems I was experiencing were not the type of problems the program treated.
	9.	It is not “mental illness” to contemplate suicide after 45 consecutive days without being able to eat or sleep due to a severe, unmanaged medical disorder. That is a foreseeable outcome of physiological collapse, not a psychiatric disorder.
    10.  The reason I was not admitted for inpatient psychiatric treatment was because my health insurance coverage had been changed without my knowledge. The plan I believed I was enrolled in would have covered an indefinite stay, but the plan that was actually in effect at the time would not cover it at all. This change prevented my institutionalization. While this intervention spared me from an unsafe and inappropriate placement, it occurred without my consent or knowledge, raising questions about who changed my coverage and for what purpose.
    11. Following the refusal of coverage, the individual presenting as my sister sent me approximately $800 via PayPal and instructed me to use the money to pay the hotel where I had been staying. However, she only gave me this instruction after she had picked me up and I had already left the hotel, making it impossible to comply. When I did not make this payment, she became angry and told me never to contact her again. This sequence of events strongly suggests a contrived setup rather than genuine familial concern, particularly given Palantir’s known connections to PayPal through Peter Thiel.
	12.	Taken together — the ex’s sudden request for power of attorney, the alleged identity and residence changes of my sister, the implausible house conditions, the controlled Airbnb lodging, the attempt at wrongful institutionalization, the insurance change, and the $800 payment — I have strong reason to believe that I was targeted in a coordinated scheme involving identity substitution or digital twin impersonation, with the objective of stripping me of liberty and property.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
