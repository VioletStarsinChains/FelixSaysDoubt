AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States of America that the following is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief:
	1.	When I first moved to Minnesota, I did not bring all of my belongings with me. I intentionally left approximately one-third of my possessions stored in the attic of my parents’ residence in Arkansas. These belongings included, but were not limited to: clothing, books, documents, journals, artwork, my college diploma, and personal effects.
	2.	It was always my understanding that these items would remain in storage until such time as I could arrange to retrieve them. I never consented to their disposal, destruction, donation, or transfer.
	3.	When I later attempted to make arrangements to recover these belongings, my sister informed me that my parents had already discarded them. At no point prior to this was I contacted or asked to pick up my property. I was not told where the items had been taken, nor by what method they were disposed of.
	4.	To this day, I have never been provided with any receipts, documentation, or explanation regarding where my property went, whether it was discarded through municipal waste, donation, or transfer to third parties.
	5.	Given the broader context of my experiences — including evidence of surveillance and attrition activities in my environment — I have reason to believe my discarded belongings may not have simply been “thrown away,” but rather redirected into systems of monitoring, digitization, or concealment.
	6.	The unilateral disposal of my property without notice or consent, and the absence of any record of what became of it, has caused me ongoing distress and raises serious questions as to whether this incident was part of a broader pattern of surveillance and targeting.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

Executed on this 6th day of September, 2025.
