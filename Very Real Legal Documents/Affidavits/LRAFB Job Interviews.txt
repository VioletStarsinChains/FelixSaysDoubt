AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	My name is Kellyn Clay. I am over the age of eighteen and competent to make this affidavit. The statements herein are based on my personal knowledge and recollection.
	2.	While I was residing in Arkansas and my then-boyfriend, Steven Dale Thompson, was serving in the United States Air Force, I applied for civilian employment positions at Little Rock Air Force Base.
	3.	I attended two separate job interviews on base for these civilian positions.
	4.	Although framed as job interviews, both interactions struck me at the time as unusual. They appeared more oriented toward data collection than genuine evaluation for employment.
	5.	I was not offered a position as a result of these interviews.
	6.	I make this affidavit to preserve the factual record of my direct interactions with the United States Air Force in a civilian capacity and my perception of the unusual nature of these interviews. I reserve the right to supplement this statement with additional details or corroborating information if they become available.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

Executed this ___ day of __________, 2025, in _______________________.
