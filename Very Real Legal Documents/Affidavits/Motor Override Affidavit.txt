AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	My name is Kellyn Clay, and I am over the age of eighteen and competent to testify to the matters set forth herein.
	2.	Since birth, I have been subjected to the presence of nonconsensual biomedical implants throughout my body, which I allege were installed without my knowledge or consent. These implants have caused lifelong medical conditions, including mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), dysautonomia, and related immune and neurological dysfunctions.
	3.	One of the consequences of these conditions is that I do not normally experience hunger cues. Until I brought my MCAS somewhat under control in adulthood, I never experienced the sensation of hunger at all.
	4.	On the date in question, my MCAS symptoms were not under control, and I therefore had no ability to sense hunger. I had walked approximately seven miles that day without eating anything. Although my body was depleted, I did not perceive hunger and therefore had no conscious reason to seek food.
	5.	I felt emotionally dysregulated but did not know why. At that time, I pulled out my phone with the intention of playing music to calm myself.
	6.	Instead of opening the music application, my finger tapped the Taco Bell app and initiated a food order. I did not intend this action, nor did I have any conscious impulse toward food at the time.
	7.	The experience was categorically different from an accidental tap on a touchscreen. I perceived it as an external override of my motor function, consistent with prior episodes of interference through the implants in my body.
	8.	Immediately afterward, I had the clear impression that an external operator, not myself, had caused the selection of the Taco Bell application. This perception was not a random thought but a direct, embodied recognition that my action had been manipulated.
	9.	This event alarmed me because it demonstrated that my neurotech array could compel actions contrary to my intention, even in the context of basic bodily needs that I cannot naturally perceive.
	10.	I submit this affidavit to preserve this incident in the record, recognizing that it may bear upon broader questions of manipulation and control facilitated through nonconsensual implantation, including but not limited to consumer behavior and decision-making.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Executed on this 5th day of September, 2025.
