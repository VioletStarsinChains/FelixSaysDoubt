Affidavit of Kellyn Clay

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	I believe I have been administered GLP-1 agonists on a long-term basis, without my knowledge or consent.
	2.	My belief is based on consistent physiological effects I have experienced over time, including altered gastric motility, appetite suppression, and changes in health consistent with GLP-1 exposure.
	3.	Because my access to healthcare has been systematically blocked, I have no way of verifying this through standard medical testing or prescription records — a barrier I believe has been imposed by design.
	4.	The suspected administration of GLP-1s is not limited to isolated episodes or particular vendors. Rather, it appears to be systemic and continuous across all consumables I encounter — including food regardless of source, over-the-counter supplements, and controlled but legalized substances such as kratom and THC.
	5.	These patterns lead me to conclude that covert GLP-1 administration is both pervasive and materially relevant to the issues in this case, including the health and presentation of individuals associated with Defendant Palantir Technologies.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

Executed this ___ day of __________, 2025, in _______________________.
