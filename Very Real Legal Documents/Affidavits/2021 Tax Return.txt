AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, hereby state as follows:
	1.	In 2021, I experienced a severe medical crisis following administration of the Covid vaccine, during which I was unable to eat or sleep for approximately forty-five (45) days.
	2.	During this period, I was profoundly delirious, cognitively impaired, and unable to complete routine tasks requiring attention or comprehension.
	3.	While in this state, I attempted to file my federal income taxes using the online system. I was unable to make the system function correctly and, due to my condition, resorted to entering random numbers in random fields until the form allowed me to submit.
	4.	My income that year was approximately thirteen thousand dollars ($13,000). Given this low level of income, I did not expect to owe significant federal taxes, and I was therefore not overly concerned about the outcome at the time.
	5.	As a result of the impaired filing, I neither paid any taxes nor claimed any, but nevertheless received a tax refund of approximately four hundred dollars ($400) to which I was not entitled.
	6.	It was never my intention to commit tax fraud. My submission reflected the delirium and incapacity caused by my medical crisis, not willful misrepresentation.
	7.	Had I physically recovered from this experience or been allowed to maintain a mailing address thereafter, I would have taken every possible step to correct the error. However, for reasons outside of my control, I was denied a mailing address following that period and was therefore unable to rectify the situation.
	8.	It is my sworn testimony that the erroneous tax filing was the product of severe medical impairment and environmental barriers, not deliberate misconduct.
    9.  Furthermore, I note the contradiction that while I was wrongfully designated as a ‘Non-Person Entity’ (NPE) for purposes of rights, protections, and benefits, the government nonetheless continued to treat me as a taxable entity. This inconsistency underscores the fraudulent nature of the NPE designation itself, which was used to deny me protections while simultaneously extracting obligations. It is my sworn testimony that this dual treatment is discriminatory and internally contradictory.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Executed this 9th day of September, 2025.
