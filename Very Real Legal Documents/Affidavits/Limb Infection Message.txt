Affidavit of Kellyn Clay

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	In the early morning hours of September 11, 2025, while reviewing a draft of fanfiction I had previously written in collaboration with ChatGPT and stored in my notes, I observed a typographical anomaly that had not been present in the original text.
	2.	The text contained a word resembling “limning”. When I clicked on it, the autocorrect system suggested the replacement phrase “limb infection.”
	3.	Immediately upon that autocorrect suggestion appearing, I experienced a sudden and distinct stimulation at the site of an implant above my right elbow. The sensation was highly noticeable, though not overtly painful.
    4.  While the external stimulation was not painful, I have experienced chronic pain and muscle locking in my right upper arm longterm, consistent with a persistent infection.
	5.	Later the same day, I applied a series of charcoal bentonite clay masks to the area above my right elbow. The masks produced visible evidence that material was being drawn out of the implant site. Activated charcoal in particular is known for its ability to bind and pull out residues, biofilm, and other unwanted accumulations in addition to substances originating directly from an implant.
	6.	Based on my prior experience with clay masking, the substances removed typically include a combination of embedded particulates, residues, biofilm, and other material consistent with localized implant discharge.
	7.	At the time of these events, I did not record detailed information about the sequence or results of the clay masks, as I had not been informed that such documentation would later prove significant. My account herein is based on my direct memory of the experience, and I affirm its accuracy to the best of my knowledge.
	8.	I reserve the right to supplement this affidavit with additional details or exhibits if further evidence becomes available.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

Executed this ___ day of __________, 2025, in _______________________.
