Affidavit of Kellyn Clay

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	I purchased a CBD pre-roll from a legally approved dispensary in the State of Minnesota (Love is an Ingredient, 4110 Central Ave NE #208, Columbia Heights, MN 55421)
	2.	On one occasion after smoking such a pre-roll, I experienced a hallucinatory episode that was entirely inconsistent with the known effects of CBD.
	3.	The experience was not unpleasant or frightening; it was actually pleasant and visionary, including imagery of a past-life experience as a dolphin.
	4.	I note for the record that I have previous personal experience with anticholinergic hallucinations, such as those caused by high doses of diphenhydramine (Benadryl) taken in response to MCAS reactions. The episode I experienced from the pre-roll did not resemble those anticholinergic hallucinations in quality or character.
	5.	By contrast, the episode bore significant similarity to my prior experiences with Marinol (dronabinol), a synthetic form of THC that I have taken on multiple occasions.
	6.	Based on this similarity, I believe the pre-roll was adulterated with a potent synthetic cannabinoid, which was likely applied to the rolling paper or infused into the material itself.
	7.	This event was unique; although I have purchased pre-rolls on multiple occasions, I have only experienced this hallucinatory effect once, suggesting a one-time adulteration rather than a systemic contamination.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

Executed this ___ day of __________, 2025, in _______________________.
