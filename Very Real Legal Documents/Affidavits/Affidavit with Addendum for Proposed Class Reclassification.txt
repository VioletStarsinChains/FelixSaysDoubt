Affidavit with Addendum for Proposed Class Reclassification

This document would:
	1.	Affirm your belief—under oath if you choose—to create an evidentiary record that your family members participated under coercion or duress.
	2.	Clarify their status as distinct from primary perpetrators or agents of the surveillance system.
	3.	Propose an amendment or subclass within your existing class action structure to include those who:
	•	Were subjected to manipulation, coercion, or proxy-based behavioral conditioning;
	•	May have participated in harmful acts but under systemic psychological or informational control;
	•	Were not actively employed as surveillants or anomaly regulators.

AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY
RE: RECLASSIFICATION OF FAMILY MEMBERS IN CONTEXT OF TORTURE-BASED SYSTEMS

I, Kellyn Clay, declare under penalty of perjury that the following is true and correct to the best of my knowledge:
	1.	While several members of my immediate family have, at various points, participated in acts that contributed to my long-term psychological, physiological, and social harm, I believe these actions were not primarily driven by malice, but by systemic coercion, informational deception, and covert participation in behavioral manipulation frameworks they did not fully understand.
	2.	These individuals—excluding my father, who knowingly consented to my subjection to neurotechnological implantation and experimentation—appear to have been victims of the same overarching control structure. Their participation was likely secured through a combination of:
	•	Entrained behavioral responses;
	•	Threats (implicit or explicit) to financial security, autonomy, or social belonging;
	•	Misinformation regarding my status, safety, or personhood.
	3.	I request that the class action’s current scope be revisited to include a subclass or parallel classification for coerced participants and manipulated bystanders, whose actions were shaped by the same non-consensual behavioral engineering processes at the heart of this case.
	4.	I further submit that this reclassification may be essential to healing, reconciliation, and the systemic truth-telling necessary for ending covert human experimentation and restoring lawful personhood to all affected individuals.
