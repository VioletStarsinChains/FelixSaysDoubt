Affidavit of Kellyn Clay

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	On the evening of September 12, 2025, at approximately 10:55 p.m., I experienced an acute episode of severe physical distress.
	2.	My symptoms included intense chest pain, pronounced weakness, dizziness, and extreme ringing in my ears (tinnitus). These symptoms occurred suddenly and simultaneously.
	3.	Unlike prior experiences of rapid heartbeat or tachycardia, my heart was not pounding at the time, though I still felt as though it was under significant strain.
	4.	The episode worsened when I attempted to lie down. The chest pain, dizziness, and ringing in my ears all intensified in the supine position, forcing me to remain upright.
	5.	I believe this event was connected to targeted implant manipulation, as the severity and constellation of symptoms do not align with my typical presentation of Mast Cell Activation Syndrome or related conditions.
	6.	This affidavit is made to formally document the timing, nature, and suspected cause of the episode for future evidentiary and medical purposes.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

Executed this ___ day of __________, 2025, in _______________________.
