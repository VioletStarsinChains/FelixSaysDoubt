AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, hereby state as follows:
	1.	In the summer of 2016, I attended the Linden Hills Farmers Market located at 2813 W 43rd St, Minneapolis, MN 55410.
	2.	While at the market, I was stung on my left hand/wrist by an insect that I believed at the time to be a bee. This was the first bee sting I had ever experienced in my life, and therefore I lacked a personal baseline for what constitutes a normal reaction.
	3.	My baseline medical condition at the time — severe Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) combined with other unmanaged illness — was so destabilized that I could not easily distinguish what aspects of my subsequent health state were attributable to the sting versus my pre-existing condition.
	4.	What I do distinctly recall is that the sting was unusually painful, that the pain persisted for several days, and that the swelling was diffuse rather than localized. The rash measured approximately six (6) inches long by four (4) inches wide.
	5.	Aware of the risks that MCAS poses, I exercised caution by asking two women working at a nearby stall to allow me to stand with them for approximately fifteen (15) minutes after the sting so they could observe me in case I developed a severe reaction.
	6.	During this time, the women told me that a person cannot have a severe reaction the first time they are stung by a bee. I corrected them by explaining that this was not true in my case because of severe MCAS, which can produce life-threatening responses even on first exposures.
	7.	In hindsight, this exchange struck me as unusual and potentially staged as part of behavioral testing, given the scripted quality of their reassurance and the fact that my condition and knowledge of MCAS put me in direct contradiction with their statement.
	8.	I do not recall purchasing anything at the market on that occasion, consistent with the fact that my MCAS at the time forced me to prepare and eat only food I cooked myself.
	9.	Based on subsequent experiences and accumulated knowledge, I now have reason to believe that this event may not have been a natural bee sting, but rather a targeted delivery mechanism potentially involving technological or pharmacological augmentation, and that Palantir Technologies Inc. may have records relevant to this incident.
	10.	I make this affidavit to preserve my recollection of the event and to support discovery into any documentary, surveillance, sensor, contractor, or analytic records that may confirm or refute my suspicions.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Executed this ___ day of _____, 2025.
