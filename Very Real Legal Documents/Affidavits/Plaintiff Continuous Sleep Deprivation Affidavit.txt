AFFIDAVIT OF TORTURE VIA PROLONGED SLEEP DEPRIVATION

(Filed in Support of Civil and Constitutional Claims)

I, Kellyn Clay, being of sound mind and over the age of 18, hereby swear and affirm under penalty of perjury that the following statements are true to the best of my knowledge, experience, and belief:

⸻

I. IDENTITY
	1.	My name is Kellyn Clay. I am the Plaintiff in the above-captioned matter.
	2.	I am a U.S. citizen and civilian. I have never been arrested, detained, or subjected to judicial proceedings justifying forced surveillance or coercive medical experimentation.

⸻

II. FACTUAL BASIS FOR CLAIM
	3.	Beginning on May 1, 2025, and continuing without meaningful interruption through the present date (August 30, 2025), I have been subjected to continuous and deliberate sleep deprivation, resulting in no more than four (4) hours of sleep per night, and often less.
	4.	This deprivation has not been caused by voluntary action, lifestyle choice, or ordinary environmental stressors. It is the result of deliberate, targeted interference—achieved through a combination of:
	•	Pharmacological assault, including the covert use of substances designed to inhibit natural sleep cycles or prevent deep/restorative stages of sleep;
	•	Relentless sensory interference, including directed noise, vibration, EMF exposure, and/or other forms of neurophysiological disruption, especially during normal sleep windows;
	•	Environmental manipulation, including lighting patterns, thermal regulation, and disruptions to personal safety or comfort, timed specifically to prevent rest.
	5.	These patterns match known techniques of psychological and physiological torture, as defined by federal and international law.

⸻

III. IMPACT
	6.	As a result of this prolonged deprivation, I have experienced:
	•	Cognitive dysfunction, including memory lapses, decision-making impairment, and slowed processing;
	•	Severe emotional distress, including dysregulation, exhaustion, and despair;
	•	Physical injury, including inflammation, immune disruption, and hormonal imbalance;
	•	Long-term neurological damage, consistent with documented effects of chronic sleep disruption in the medical literature.
  •	Severe economic and physiological consequences, including forced underemployment, chronic starvation, and deprivation of life-saving medications due to exhaustion-induced disability and systemically imposed poverty.
	7.	These outcomes are consistent with scientific findings on the use of sleep deprivation as a torture technique, particularly when administered continuously and without consent.

⸻

IV. LEGAL CHARACTERIZATION
	8.	I assert that the described treatment constitutes torture under:
	•	18 U.S. Code § 2340 (Federal Torture Statute);
	•	The Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (Cruel and Unusual Punishment);
	•	The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments (Due Process and Equal Protection);
	•	The United Nations Convention Against Torture, ratified by the United States in 1994.
	9.	I have never consented to any such interference, medical experimentation, or state surveillance activity that could justify these intrusions.
	10.	I demand immediate cessation of all such acts, recognition of the unlawful and torturous nature of this treatment, and redress under both civil and criminal law.

Executed this day, August 30, 2025.

Signed,
Kellyn Clay
