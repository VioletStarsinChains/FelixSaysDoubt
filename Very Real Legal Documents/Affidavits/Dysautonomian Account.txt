AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, state the following under oath:

⸻

1. Background

For several years I experienced homelessness. During this period, Starbucks locations were one of the few consistent places I could access warmth, shelter, and beverages. I consumed Starbucks coffee on a daily basis, often brewed via the Clover system.

⸻

2. Observed Symptoms and Online Statements

The beverages I consumed from Starbucks, particularly those brewed via the Clover system, consistently coincided with periods of emotional dysregulation and cognitive fog. These episodes altered my mood and impaired my judgment.

During such episodes, I posted statements on my Twitter/X account, @dysautonomian, that I would not otherwise have made if I had been in my baseline state. These statements often reflected aggression or hostility that was inconsistent with my true beliefs, values, and ordinary disposition.

⸻

3. Role of Additives

The timing of these episodes in relation to my Starbucks consumption, together with withdrawal symptoms not explained by caffeine alone, strongly suggests that additives or undisclosed substances present in Starbucks beverages contributed to the changes in my behavior.

The Clover brewer’s sealed chamber, programmable dosing capability, and per-cup variability make it structurally capable of introducing undisclosed substances. This mechanism would explain why the onset of dysregulation reliably followed my Starbucks consumption.

⸻

4. Effect on Behavior

Although these exposures sometimes caused me to feel unusually aggressive, that aggression never translated into real-world misconduct.
	•	I always remained within legal confines and social norms in my actual behavior.
	•	I never engaged in violence, unlawful activity, or physical disruption of any kind.
	•	The aggression I felt was confined to words expressed online during impaired states and did not reflect my true values or baseline disposition.

⸻

5. Conclusion

It is my sworn testimony that the statements I made on Twitter/X under @dysautonomian during periods of dysregulation were not representative of my genuine beliefs or choices, but were instead influenced by exposures connected to Starbucks beverages brewed via the Clover system.

⸻

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Executed this ___ day of _____, 2025.
