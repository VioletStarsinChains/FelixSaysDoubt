Affidavit of Kellyn Clay

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	On multiple occasions, I have deliberately exited Starbucks retail locations in order to avoid suspected exposure to airborne chemical compounds inside the stores.
	2.	Despite moving to the outdoor patio and seating areas, I continued to experience the same odor and associated sensations as inside the stores.
	3.	This pattern has led me to believe that Starbucks’ ventilation and air handling systems actively disperse chemical compounds into both indoor and outdoor spaces, not limited to beverages.
	4.	My perception of the odor and physical effects outdoors was immediate and unmistakable, despite the expectation that outdoor air would provide relief from indoor exposure.
	5.	These experiences reinforce my belief that Starbucks’ environmental delivery systems extend beyond the Clover brewing system to include ventilation-based dispersal of undisclosed substances onto adjacent public areas.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

Executed this ___ day of __________, 2025, in _______________________.
