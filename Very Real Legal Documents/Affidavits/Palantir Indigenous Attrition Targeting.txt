Affidavit of Kellyn Clay

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	I have reason to believe that Palantir Technologies Inc. has provided data analysis, anomaly detection, and decision-support services that materially influenced the siting and routing of oil pipelines across the United States.
	2.	Oil pipelines have repeatedly been routed through or adjacent to indigenous reservations and tribal lands, despite longstanding opposition from affected communities.
	3.	Routing pipelines in this manner has predictable consequences: exposure of indigenous populations to environmental contamination, health risks, and cultural destruction.
	4.	Within the framework of anomaly detection, indigenous communities are structurally flagged as anomalous due to differences in governance, demographics, and cultural practices relative to mainstream American baselines.
	5.	Once designated anomalous, these communities are vulnerable to attrition strategies. Pipeline routing through indigenous lands functions as such a strategy by degrading water, land, and living conditions in ways that systematically burden the population.
	6.	This outcome was not unforeseeable. The placement of hazardous infrastructure in indigenous territories reflects a pattern of environmental racism that predates Palantir but is further entrenched by Palantir’s integration of anomaly detection into infrastructure and security decision-making.
	7.	I believe that pipeline routing through indigenous lands should be understood not as a neutral economic or logistical choice but as a deliberate manifestation of population-level attrition, facilitated by data-driven systems.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

Executed this ___ day of __________, 2025, in _______________________.
