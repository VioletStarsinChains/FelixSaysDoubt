AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	During my young adulthood, I was unable to attend church services because my medical condition, Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), made it physically harmful for me to sit in enclosed spaces with groups of people.
	2.	My absence from Protestant church attendance was not based on belief or preference, but on disability.
	3.	Despite this, I attended a Christian school every day that I attended school, from childhood through graduation. Thus, I was immersed in religious instruction five days a week. Nevertheless, my economic access was conditioned on extending this immersion into Sunday church attendance.
	4.	After more than two years of being unemployed despite submitting at least five job applications per week, I finally obtained a position on my own. Shortly afterward, my father stated to me that he could have helped me find a job earlier, but he chose not to because I was not attending church.
	5.	He had never informed me prior to that moment that his assistance was contingent on church attendance. This made clear that economic support was withheld not because I lacked religious exposure, but because I could not comply with the additional expectation of weekly church attendance.
	6.	This experience demonstrates how disability can be weaponized against an individual where social and economic access is conditioned on participation in religious activities, even when that individual is already receiving continuous religious instruction.
	7.	I believe this pattern reflects broader risks of disability discrimination when anomaly classification systems use religious participation as a proxy for normalcy, without accounting for those who are medically unable to conform.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

Executed on this 4th day of September, 2025.
