AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	During my young adulthood, I was unable to attend church services because my medical condition, Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), made it physically harmful for me to sit in enclosed spaces with groups of people.
	2.	As a result, I was absent from Protestant church attendance, which in the community where I lived was regarded as a social baseline. My absence was not based on choice or belief, but on disability.
	3.	I believe that such absence may have contributed to my being treated as an “anomaly” under data-driven classification systems, which often rely on cultural participation as a marker of normalcy.
	4.	This experience was echoed in my personal life. After more than two years of being unemployed despite submitting at least five job applications per week, I finally obtained a position on my own. Shortly afterward, my father stated to me that he could have helped me find a job earlier, but he chose not to because I was not attending church.
	5.	He had never informed me prior to that moment that his assistance was contingent on church attendance. This made clear that economic access in my family context was conditioned on compliance with religious participation, which I was medically unable to provide.
	6.	I submit this affidavit to document that my absence from church attendance was a function of disability, not personal preference, and that I experienced real economic exclusion as a result. I believe this pattern reflects broader risks of disability discrimination when anomaly classification systems use religious participation as a proxy for normalcy.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

Executed on this 4th day of September, 2025.
