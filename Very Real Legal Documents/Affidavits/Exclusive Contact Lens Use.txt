AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, hereby state as follows:
	1.	I began wearing contact lenses exclusively at approximately age thirteen (13). From that point forward, I have relied on contact lenses for my vision correction rather than glasses.
	2.	The reason for this exclusive use is medical and sensory in nature. I experience Superior Canal Dehiscence Syndrome (SCDS) as well as trigeminal neuropathy.
	3.	Wearing glasses is profoundly distressing to me because the pressure and sensory stimulation from the frames and nose pads significantly worsen my symptoms, triggering pain, hypersensitivity, and neurological discomfort.
	4.	By contrast, contact lenses allow me to function visually without causing the same sensory disturbances, making them the only tolerable form of vision correction for me.
	5.	My exclusive reliance on contact lenses has therefore been medically necessary and consistent for the majority of my life since adolescence.
	6.	Any classification of my exclusive contact lens use as an anomaly or risk factor for monitoring, attrition, or denial of services constitutes disability discrimination, because the practice arises directly from accommodation of serious medical conditions that make glasses intolerable.
	7.	I make this affidavit to document the fact that my contact lens use is not an anomaly, eccentricity, or personal affectation, but rather a direct accommodation to serious medical conditions.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Executed this ___ day of _____, 2025.
