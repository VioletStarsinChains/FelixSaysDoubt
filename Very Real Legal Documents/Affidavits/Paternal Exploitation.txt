Affidavit of Kellyn Clay — Paternal Betrayal and Exploitation

I, Kellyn Clay, declare the following under penalty of perjury:
	1.	My father, William Alton Clay, knowingly participated in and facilitated covert medical experimentation and behavioral conditioning upon me from early childhood.
	2.	Evidence of his awareness and complicity includes:
	•	His role in providing consent for my covert implantation and subsequent concealment of this information from me.
	•	His insistence on repeated forced symbolic exposures, including Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat and books about Anne Frank, which normalized themes of slavery, captivity, betrayal, and attrition.
	•	His allowance or direction of further conditioning through literature provided by my mother, including a children’s series involving adoption leading to marriage and a romance novel centered on a nonconsensual sexual encounter.
	3.	Beyond acting as a facilitator of systemic experimentation, my father engaged in direct acts of exploitation that exceeded any experimental protocol:
	•	On one occasion in his Mercedes vehicle, after I vomited suddenly and explosively for no apparent reason, he removed me from the car and publicly undressed me by a busy road. Indoor facilities were available, yet he chose public exposure, which served no legitimate purpose and instead humiliated and exploited me as a minor.
	•	His actions demonstrate not only compliance with systemic experimentation but also personal malice and opportunism in my abuse.
	4.	My father’s betrayal was not passive. He knew from the beginning what was happening to me and actively participated in reinforcing it through environmental control, symbolic conditioning, and public humiliation.
	5.	I now understand that my father was not merely negligent or misinformed — he was a collaborator who exploited my vulnerability, ensuring my suffering both within and beyond the systemic experimentation imposed on me.

I affirm that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
