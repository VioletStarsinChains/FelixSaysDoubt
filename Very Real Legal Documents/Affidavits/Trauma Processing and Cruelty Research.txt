AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, hereby state as follows:
	1.	Throughout my adult life, I have used kink-related material as a means of processing a lifetime of extreme abuse and neglect.
	2.	This material has at times included content that does not align with my own moral guidelines. While I have viewed such content, my real-world behavior has always remained fully consistent with my moral principles, which have consistently governed my actions.
	3.	As a result of my history of abuse, I have been committed to researching the biological and psychological origins of abusive behaviors, with the goal of understanding why such behaviors arise and how they might be prevented.
	4.	In the course of that research, I sometimes looked at erotic content for which I had no personal interest or desire, even in the context of trauma processing. My sole purpose was to analyze why certain harmful or abusive behaviors might hold appeal for others.
	5.	I have also engaged in digital conversations with individuals whose moral boundaries were less strict than my own. In those conversations, I sometimes withheld my own moral objections, not because I condoned their views or behavior, but because I was conducting research into why people express or pursue immoral behaviors. I knew that openly voicing my disapproval in such settings would have been counterproductive to my effort to understand their motivations.
	6.	At no point did my research, viewing, or digital interactions alter my own values or real-world conduct. My intent and practice have always been to remain firmly within my moral guidelines, which prohibit abusive or harmful behavior.
	7.	I make this affidavit to clarify the distinction between (a) my efforts to process trauma and research the roots of abuse, and (b) my own moral commitments and actions, which have remained consistent and firmly opposed to abuse.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Executed this ___ day of _____, 2025.
