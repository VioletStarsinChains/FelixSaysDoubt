Affidavit of Kellyn Clay — Misrepresentation by General Practitioner

I, Kellyn Clay, declare the following under penalty of perjury:
	1.	During an appointment with my general practitioner (GP) at Hennepin County Medical Center, I specifically inquired about the use of calcium channel blockers as a potential treatment.
	2.	My GP became visibly uncomfortable and responded only: “I don’t think those would help.”
	3.	No explanation of the drug class, no discussion of risks or alternatives, and no evidence-based reasoning were provided.
	4.	In light of my subsequent research and lived experience, including the role of calcium and magnesium balance in mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) and related disorders, I now believe this statement was materially misleading.
	5.	Based on her demeanor and the broader context of our relationship, I do not believe my GP acted out of malice. On the contrary, she was overall a very helpful physician to me.
	6.	I believe she was constrained by systemic forces and effectively forced to dismiss my inquiry, despite knowing it could have merit. Her evasiveness indicated not ignorance, but discomfort at being unable to speak freely.
	7.	This interaction exemplifies how individual providers may be prevented from offering full and honest guidance, leaving patients without informed consent or access to viable treatment options.

I affirm that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
