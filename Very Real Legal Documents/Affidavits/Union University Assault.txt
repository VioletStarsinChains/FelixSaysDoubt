AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	During my time at Union University, I was drawn into social relationships that did not feel organic but rather engineered. A group of alumni forcibly positioned themselves as my “friends” and directed my social environment in ways that felt unnatural and exploitative.
	2.	One alumna in particular acted as a mentor to me, Kristen Nicole Sayres.  Through her, I was introduced to an individual named William Parks (not an alumnus), whose behavior suggested he had been placed in my life to manipulate and influence me.
	3.	William in turn introduced me to an individual named Matt Cohn. Matt later sexually assaulted me.
	4.	Prior to this assault, there was an incident in which William asked me to accompany him to a gym. On the way there, he appeared to experience a crisis of conscience, saying aloud, “I can’t do this.” He then turned the car around and took me back. Based on the sequence of events that followed, I believe William had been expected to assault me that day but refused, and another person (Matt) was instead tasked with doing so.
	5.	I further believe that one of the purposes of the assault was to drive me to seek medical care in the emergency room, where I was subjected to procedures associated with a sexual assault kit. Under conditions that were already coercive and traumatizing, I was subjected to invasive examination and biosurveillance practices without meaningful consent.
	6.	These experiences were not isolated accidents but appeared coordinated and deliberate, with multiple individuals positioned around me to ensure that an assault occurred and that it produced downstream medical interventions.
	7.	The combination of coerced assault and involuntary medical examination constituted torture and exploitation, leaving lasting harm and violating my fundamental rights.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

Executed on this 4th day of September, 2025.
