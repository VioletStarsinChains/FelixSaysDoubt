AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	My name is Kellyn Clay. I am over the age of eighteen and competent to testify to the matters set forth herein.
	2.	My grandmother, Eugenia Clay Head, died in or around 2011.
	3.	Following her death, my siblings each received property or items from her estate. These distributions included pieces from her collection of antiques, as she had been an antique dealer with an extensive inventory intended for family inheritance.
	4.	I received nothing from her estate — not even a token item — despite the fact that we were on good terms at the time of her death.
	5.	This exclusion was unusual, particularly because I am named after her (my full legal name being Kellyn Eugenia Clay). In my family, naming patterns were meaningful, and the absence of any inheritance from a namesake relationship was striking in retrospect.
	6.	At the time, I did not question this outcome. I have long considered myself a minimalist and do not enjoy accumulating objects that serve no purpose in my space. For this reason, I accepted my exclusion as inconsequential at that time.
	7.	Only years later, after reflecting on the matter and learning of the distributions made to my siblings, did I recognize the irregularity of the situation.
	8.	To the best of my knowledge, I never signed any waiver, disclaimer, or renunciation of inheritance. No one from the family or estate ever asked me to do so.
	9.	I make this affidavit to preserve my recollection of events surrounding my grandmother’s estate and my exclusion from inheritance, recognizing that this may be relevant to questions of probate, fiduciary duty, and potential mismanagement.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Executed on this 5th day of September, 2025.
