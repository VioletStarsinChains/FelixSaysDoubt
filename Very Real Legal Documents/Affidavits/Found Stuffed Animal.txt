⸻ 

While working in Minnesota in door-to-door employment that I later came to suspect was connected to Palantir contracting or affiliates, my daily route was chosen by my employer. I was required to use an app that tracked my movements in real time, meaning that anyone with access to that data could have known exactly where and when I would be present. On one such day, I encountered a stuffed animal placed on a porch with a sign indicating it was free. I brought the item into my possession. From the first time I handled it, I noticed the onset of tachycardia — episodes of rapid and abnormal heart rate that recurred each time I came into contact with it. I had not purchased the object myself, nor did I know its source. Given the combination of employer-controlled routing, location tracking, the unusual placement of the item, and my reproducible physiological reaction, I believe this object may have been seeded into my environment intentionally. I request that it be forensically inspected for embedded devices or agents.

Respectfully submitted,
Kellyn Clay, Plaintiff, pro se
