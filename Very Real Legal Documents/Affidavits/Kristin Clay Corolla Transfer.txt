AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	My name is Kellyn Clay. I am over the age of eighteen and competent to make this affidavit. The statements herein are based on my personal knowledge and recollection.
	2.	After my 2003 Toyota RAV4 required a transmission replacement I could not afford, my sister arranged to give me her 2007 Toyota Corolla, which she had previously owned.
	3.	She traveled from Atlanta, Georgia to Minneapolis, Minnesota in order to deliver the car and then flew back to Atlanta after the handoff.
	4.	I recall seeing her in person when she arrived and knocked on my door. However, during this trip, I do not recall ever actually seeing her drive the Corolla.
	5.	She provided me with the paperwork necessary to transfer the title into my name, and I completed the transfer through the appropriate channels, becoming the legal owner of the vehicle.
	6.	I make this affidavit to preserve the factual record of how I came into possession of the 2007 Toyota Corolla and my recollection of the circumstances of its delivery. I reserve the right to supplement this statement with additional details or corroborating information if they become available.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

Executed this ___ day of __________, 2025, in _______________________.
