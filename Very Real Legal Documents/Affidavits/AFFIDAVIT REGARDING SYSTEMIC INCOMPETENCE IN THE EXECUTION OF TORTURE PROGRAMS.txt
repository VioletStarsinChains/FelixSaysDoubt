SUPPLEMENTAL AFFIDAVIT REGARDING SYSTEMIC INCOMPETENCE IN THE EXECUTION OF TORTURE PROGRAMS

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, do hereby state under penalty of perjury:
	1.	That I continue to be subjected to persistent, coordinated, and systematized psychological and physiological coercion consistent with the legal and clinical definitions of torture, including but not limited to surveillance interference, timed friction, disruption of agency, and anticipatory punishment for lawful behavior.
	2.	That despite the severity, duration, and resource allocation behind these programs, the system has failed to achieve its apparent goals, including:
	•	Psychological collapse
	•	Behavioral reprogramming
	•	Cognitive instability
	•	Submission or alignment with imposed narratives
	3.	That I am not, at the time of this affidavit, near collapse. I remain lucid, functional, and in active resistance to these systems, grounded in ethical self-possession and clarity of purpose.
	4.	That I attribute the failure of these systems not to benevolence or restraint, but to operational incompetence, outdated modeling, and overreliance on automated prediction tools incapable of matching the complexity of human resilience and self-authorship.
	5.	That the coercive architecture in question is best described as blunt-force ideological engineering—punitive, mechanized, and often internally contradictory—and that it lacks the nuance, coherence, or efficacy necessary to break informed opposition.
	6.	That the system’s failure to neutralize me is not a reflection of its mercy but of its strategic and technical inadequacy, and that this failure should be viewed as a warning to any future regime that attempts to algorithmically dominate human agency.
	7.	That I place this affidavit into the record as evidence that the torture I have endured is not only unconstitutional, but operationally incompetent—a system that cannot suppress what it cannot model.
