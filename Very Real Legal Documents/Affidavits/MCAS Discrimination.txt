AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, hereby state as follows:
	1.	Throughout my adult life, I have been compelled to change living arrangements approximately once every twelve (12) months on average.
	2.	The reason for this instability is my medical condition, Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), which causes me to gradually develop a broad intolerance to any environment in which I remain for an extended period of time. Over time, exposures accumulate to the point where continued residence becomes physically untenable.
	3.	The same pattern has also applied to my employment situations. In each workplace, environmental exposures eventually aggravated my condition to the point that I could no longer remain employed there without triggering severe health consequences.
	4.	These repeated disruptions to housing and employment are not voluntary lifestyle choices. They are direct consequences of a serious and disabling medical condition that substantially limits my ability to remain in one place over time.
	5.	I believe that any targeting, penalization, or denial of access to essential services on the basis of these housing and employment patterns constitutes disability discrimination under applicable law.
	6.	My history demonstrates that my instability of residence and employment is a function of MCAS and not of irresponsibility, transience, or lack of effort. I have consistently sought stability, but the physiological realities of my condition prevent me from sustaining it.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Executed this ___ day of _____, 2025.
