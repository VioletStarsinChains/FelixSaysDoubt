AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, state as follows:
	1.	Identity of Affiant
 I am the Plaintiff in the matter Kellyn Clay v. United States of America, et al. pending in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota. I make this affidavit based on my personal knowledge.
	2.	Relationship to Subject
 The subject of this affidavit is my father, William Alton Clay.
	3.	Observed Behavior
 Throughout my upbringing, my father engaged in petty acts of cruelty in nearly every aspect of his daily life.
 a. This included joking about harming animals, including repeated references to torturing kittens, which he presented as humorous.
 b. To my knowledge, he never actually engaged in acts of animal torture; however, the persistent joking and trivialization of cruelty created an environment in which harm was normalized and empathy was absent.
 c. His approach to family life, conversation, and discipline consistently reflected a willingness to use information against others in ways that were manipulative, belittling, or cruel.
	4.	Impact on Affiant
 As a result of this environment, I subconsciously learned from a young age to hide my every desire, intention, and vulnerability from my father — and by extension, from others.
 a. I understood that if he knew anything about me, he would find a way to use it against me.
 b. This produced a lifelong pattern of self-concealment, hypervigilance, and distrust, not by choice but as an adaptive survival mechanism in my home.
 c. These dynamics, entirely outside of my control as a child, shaped my behavioral patterns in enduring ways.
	5.	Connection to Broader Systems
 I believe this upbringing is a major contributing factor to why I have been labeled an “anomaly” in systems like those developed by Palantir Technologies Inc.
 a. My learned behaviors of concealment, deflection, and distrust — rational responses to an environment of cruelty — are misread by automated systems as signs of duplicity, abnormality, or risk.
 b. In reality, these behaviors are the residue of survival strategies in a coercive family environment, not evidence of criminality, instability, or dangerousness.
 c. By ignoring this context, anomaly-classification systems reproduce the same punitive dynamics I experienced at home, treating adaptive behaviors as suspicious instead of understanding them as protective.
	6.	Purpose of Affidavit
 I make this affidavit not to accuse my father of actions he did not commit, but to document the environment of cruelty and minimization in which I was raised, and to explain how that environment continues to shape how predictive analytics misinterpret me today.
