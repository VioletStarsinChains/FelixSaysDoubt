AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	My name is Kellyn Clay. I am over the age of eighteen and competent to make this affidavit. The statements herein are based on my personal knowledge and recollection.
	2.	After leaving the United States Air Force, my then-boyfriend, Steven Dale Thompson, joined the Air National Guard. Instead of joining a unit near Minneapolis, where we lived at the time, he joined a unit in Duluth, Minnesota.
	3.	On one occasion, Steven asked me to drive to Duluth while he was attending a drill with the Air National Guard. We stayed in a hotel room that had been provided to him by the Air National Guard.
	4.	During that trip, my vehicle was broken into. Every possible compartment or container inside the car had clearly been searched.
	5.	At that time, I was experiencing a severe flare of Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), and I had filled the glove box, center console, and other compartments of the car with used tissues. When I returned to the car, the tissues were scattered throughout the vehicle, confirming that every space had been opened and searched.
	6.	This incident led me to believe that the break-in was more than simple theft, and that it involved a deliberate search of the vehicle.
	7.	More generally, Steven repeatedly told me that it was best to leave my car unlocked, on the reasoning that it was preferable for people to steal items than for them to break my windows. I followed his advice.
	8.	As a result of leaving my car unlocked on another occasion, an iPod containing intimate personal photographs of me was stolen.
	9.	I make this affidavit to preserve the factual record of these events and patterns as I directly recall them. I reserve the right to supplement this statement with additional details or corroborating information if they become available.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

Executed this ___ day of __________, 2025, in _______________________.
