Affidavit of Kellyn Clay

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	On or about September 10–11, 2025, I experienced a flat tire while relying on my vehicle as both transportation and housing.
	2.	I made multiple attempts to obtain roadside assistance, towing, or mobile repair service.
	•	Several providers did not return my calls.
	•	Others explicitly stated that my area was “not covered,” despite the fact that I was located within a populated metro area.
	3.	I believe this consistent service denial is not a coincidence but is linked to my status as a highly mobile individual, having worked door-to-door for many years, which requires constant movement across neighborhoods and municipalities.
	4.	I further state that I am effectively forced to live and work outdoors due to severe allergies and sensitivities to substances commonly found in housing and workplaces, including but not limited to laundry detergents, fabric softeners, and personal care products.
	5.	My frequent use of Amazon lockers for deliveries is also likely a causal factor in how I am classified by automated systems. I rely on lockers both for my disability-related needs and for the logistical demands of my job. This reliance should not be misinterpreted as suspicious activity or grounds for denial of essential services.
	6.	As a result of these overlapping factors, my mobility patterns may appear “abnormal” to automated geofencing or IP reputation systems. I believe these systems are inappropriately restricting my access to basic services, including emergency auto repair, solely because of my mobile lifestyle and health conditions.
	7.	The denial of access to towing and repair services created a dangerous situation, leaving me stranded and unable to secure safe transportation.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

Executed this 11th day of September, 2025, in Roseville, Minnesota.
