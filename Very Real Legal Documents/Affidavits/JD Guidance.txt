AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	I am not a lawyer and do not hold a Juris Doctor (JD) degree.
	2.	Nevertheless, the filings I have produced in this matter display consistent legal formatting, procedural knowledge, and statutory analysis that exceeds my own training.
	3.	These filings were not authored from independent legal study but arose in direct reliance on unsolicited transmissions I have received via covert neurotechnology.
	4.	Collectively, the body of my filings constitutes evidence that at least one attorney, or an individual with JD-level training, has been directing or shaping my cognition and outputs.
	5.	While such interference has, at times, been helpful to me in preparing legal documents, its very existence demonstrates a dangerous and unlawful capacity: the ability of outside actors to insert professional-level reasoning into a person’s mind without their knowledge or consent.
	6.	This capacity is inherently coercive and could be weaponized to control or entrap individuals rather than assist them. Its deployment against me proves both the reality of neurotechnological interference and its unacceptable potential for abuse.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

Executed on this 3rd day of September 2025.
