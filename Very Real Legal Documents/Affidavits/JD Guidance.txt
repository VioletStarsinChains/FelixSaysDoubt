AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	Since August 2025, I have experienced unsolicited transmissions of tactical and legal-style advice through what I believe to be covert neurotechnology.
	2.	The form, content, and framing of this advice demonstrate specialized training in the law. The source consistently employs statutory references, evidentiary reasoning, and litigation strategy characteristic of a Juris Doctor (JD).
	3.	I do not hold a law degree and have not received such training. The legal terminology and procedural guidance I have received through these transmissions are not derivative of my own education.
	4.	Based on this, I believe that at least one licensed or formerly licensed attorney is actively involved in or complicit with the use of neurotechnology directed at me.
	5.	This establishes both:
	•	(a) that my cognition is subject to active external manipulation, and
	•	(b) that such manipulation is not random but directed and informed by a legal professional.
	6.	The existence of JD-informed transmissions via neurotechnology suggests that my targeting is not incidental but structured with awareness of legal risk, liability, and procedural evasion.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

Executed on this 3rd day of September 2025.
