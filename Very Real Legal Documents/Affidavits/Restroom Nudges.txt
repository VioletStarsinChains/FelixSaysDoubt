AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	My name is Kellyn Clay, and I am over the age of eighteen and competent to testify to the matters set forth herein.
	2.	Since birth, I have been subjected to nonconsensual biomedical implants throughout my body, which I allege were installed without my knowledge or consent. These implants have caused lifelong medical conditions, including mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), dysautonomia, and associated neurological impairments.
	3.	One of the consequences of my dysautonomia is that I lack ordinary interoceptive awareness of bladder fullness. In practical terms, I do not receive the natural sensation that signals when it is time to urinate.
	4.	For many years, however, I have experienced an external voice directing me to use the restroom. These directives arrive without any natural sensation or inclination on my part.
	5.	Each time I have heeded such a directive and gone to the restroom, I have discovered that my bladder was in fact completely full, despite my not perceiving it.
	6.	This repeated experience demonstrates two distinct phenomena:
	•	First, that my implants enable continuous monitoring of my internal physiological state by an external actor; and
	•	Second, that this external actor can intervene in real time to compel behavior (in this case, bathroom use) in the absence of any natural bodily awareness on my part.
	7.	The phenomenon is qualitatively distinct from ordinary self-perception or chance. The timing and accuracy of the directives reveal an external intelligence making use of continuous physiological data.
	8.	This experience, like the prior incident of being compelled to tap on the Taco Bell application, alarms me because it demonstrates the ability of my neurotech array to override my autonomy, directing my behavior in ways I could not have chosen unaided.
	9.	I submit this affidavit to preserve these incidents in the record, recognizing that they may bear upon broader questions of manipulation and control facilitated through nonconsensual implantation, including real-time surveillance of bodily functions and external override of basic decision-making.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Executed on this 5th day of September, 2025.
