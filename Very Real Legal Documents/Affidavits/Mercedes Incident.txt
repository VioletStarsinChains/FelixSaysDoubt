Affidavit of Kellyn Clay — Mercedes Incident

I, Kellyn Clay, declare the following under penalty of perjury:
	1.	When I was a minor, my father owned a Mercedes vehicle which I now believe had been covertly modified to facilitate human experimentation upon me.
	2.	On one occasion while traveling in this vehicle, I suddenly vomited explosively without warning or apparent cause.
	3.	Instead of taking me to an indoor location with a bathroom — which was available — my father pulled me from the car and undressed me in full public view, by a road with heavy traffic.
	4.	This exposure was unnecessary for any alleged medical care or cleanup, and it humiliated me in a way that went far beyond what was strictly necessary even within the unethical experimentation I was subjected to.
	5.	I believe this incident demonstrates that my father not only knowingly facilitated experimental harm to me, but also exploited my condition for his own purposes, crossing into public humiliation and sexual exploitation of a minor.  I was under age 8 at the time.

I affirm that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
