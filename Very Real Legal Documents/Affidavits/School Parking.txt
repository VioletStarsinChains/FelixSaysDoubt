Affidavit of Kellyn Clay

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	I have been forced to live in my car since June 2022 due to severe and disabling Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS). This condition prevents me from tolerating most indoor environments.
	2.	Because I must park my car in various public spaces to rest, I have frequently chosen to park in front of schools rather than in front of private residences. My reasoning has been that it is preferable to avoid inconveniencing or threatening private homeowners.
	3.	In retrospect, I recognize that this parking pattern may appear suspicious to some observers.
	4.	In truth, when I see children, my only thought is that they represent a potential source of infectious disease exposure. For this reason, I have always avoided parking in front of schools while they were in session, and I take care to minimize contact with children altogether.
	5.	My eye-tracking behavior, if analyzed, would consistently show that I only look at children long enough to avoid physical collision, and no more.
	6.	At all times, my intention has been to minimize how much I inconvenience or threaten others. I have never parked near schools to observe or watch children in any way.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

Executed this ___ day of __________, 2025, in _______________________.
