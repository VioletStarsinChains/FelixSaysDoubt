AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

1.	I have been diagnosed with Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), a severe medical condition that causes my body to react unpredictably and dangerously to common environmental triggers.
	2.	In order to manage this condition and protect my health, I am required to wear a respirator mask in public as much as possible. This practice significantly reduces my risk of life-threatening inflammatory or anaphylactic reactions.
	3.	My respirator use is not a matter of personal preference, eccentricity, or social signaling, but rather a medically necessary accommodation for a serious disability.
	4.	My respirator use is my only reliable public-health accommodation for safely accessing community spaces. Without this accommodation, I cannot consistently mitigate the dangers created by my condition.
	5.	I am aware that Palantir Technologies Inc. and related surveillance systems may classify individuals based on visible behaviors or appearances, and that respirator mask use in public may be misclassified as anomalous behavior within such systems.
	6.	Any classification of my respirator mask use as “anomaly,” and any resulting targeting for attrition, increased monitoring, or denial of services, is discriminatory.
	7.	Treating a medically necessary accommodation as evidence of subversion, anomaly, or risk constitutes disability discrimination under applicable civil rights frameworks, whether by security agencies (such as DHS or DOJ) or health agencies (such as HHS or NIH).
	8.	It is my sworn testimony that my respirator use is an essential medical accommodation and must not be used as a basis for punitive classification or denial of access to services.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Executed this ___ day of _____, 2025.
