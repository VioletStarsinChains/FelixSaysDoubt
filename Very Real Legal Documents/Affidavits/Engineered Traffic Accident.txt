AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	On September 4, 2025, at approximately 9:40 AM, I was driving westbound on County Road C West in Roseville, Minnesota, approaching the intersection with Cleveland Avenue.
	2.	The conditions were broad daylight and visibility was clear.
	3.	As I entered the intersection, the traffic light in my direction displayed a green light.
	4.	At the same moment, a semi-truck traveling eastbound on County Road C West began to execute a left turn onto Cleveland Avenue directly across my lane of travel, as though the truck had been given a green left-turn arrow.
	5.	I stopped in time to avoid collision with the first semi-truck.
	6.	Immediately following this, a second semi-truck behind the first also began a left turn across my path, again behaving as if it had a green arrow while I simultaneously had a green light.
	7.	The second semi-truck only stopped when the driver observed that a vehicle in the lane to my left (also traveling westbound) was proceeding into the intersection on its green light.
	8.	The fact that two separate semi-trucks initiated left turns against my green light establishes that this was not a case of a single inattentive driver or a risky maneuver, but rather a traffic signal malfunction that gave conflicting right-of-way indications.
	9.	This malfunction created a situation where I narrowly avoided a serious collision, one that could easily have been fatal given the size and speed of the semi-trucks.
	10.	Immediately prior to this incident, my cell phone malfunctioned in a way that prevented me from looking at it while driving. I believe this intervention may have been intended to protect me from distraction in light of the imminent hazard.
	11.	Based on the timing, sequence, and nature of this event, I believe the traffic signal failure was not random, but part of a pattern of intimidation and attempted harm directed against me.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Executed this 4th day of September, 2025.
