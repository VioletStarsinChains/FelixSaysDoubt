Affidavit of Kellyn Clay — Restroom Lock Incident in Cancún

I, Kellyn Clay, declare the following under penalty of perjury:
	1.	As a child, I traveled with my family on a vacation to Cancún, Mexico.
	2.	During that trip, we dined at a large and upscale restaurant located in a developed part of Cancún.
	3.	When I needed to use the restroom, I was directed to a facility that was detached from the main restaurant building and required a significant walk from the dining area.
	4.	After using the restroom, I found that the door would not unlock. I attempted multiple times to open it, but nothing I did released the lock.
	5.	I was trapped inside the restroom for approximately fifteen (15) minutes.
	6.	At a certain point, the door suddenly unlocked on its own without any intervention on my part.
	7.	I was then able to leave the restroom and return to my family.
	8.	This incident was unusual and alarming, given that the restaurant was otherwise upscale and located in a developed area where restroom facilities would normally be expected to function properly.
	9.	I do not know the cause of the malfunction. I can only affirm that I was locked inside and unable to exit for approximately fifteen minutes until the door released itself.
    10. When I returned to the dining area, I observed my parents’ reaction. They appeared visibly surprised to see me return.
	11.	This response struck me as unusual, given that they knew I had only gone to use the restroom and should have expected me back promptly.
	12.	In retrospect, their surprise raises serious concerns that they may have anticipated, or at minimum accepted, that I would not return from the restroom in the ordinary way.

I affirm that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
