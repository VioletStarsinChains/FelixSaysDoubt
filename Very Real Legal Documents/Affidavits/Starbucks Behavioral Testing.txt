UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

Kellyn Clay, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated,
Plaintiff,

v.

Starbucks Corporation,
Defendant

⸻ 

Affidavit of Kellyn Clay

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	I have repeatedly been subjected to experiences that felt like behavioral testing inside Starbucks retail locations.
	2.	These experiences occurred not only while I was a customer, but also during the period when I was briefly employed by Starbucks as a barista.
	3.	The recurrence of these incidents across roles, years, and multiple store locations suggests that they were not isolated or coincidental.
	4.	I will provide additional specific details of these incidents in supplemental filings, but I note for the record that they consistently carried the quality of being engineered tests or provocations rather than ordinary consumer or employee interactions.
	5.	The first such incident I recall occurred while I was still in high school. During a visit to a Starbucks store, a middle-aged female barista told me that I was “hot.” This statement struck me as highly unusual, inappropriate, and contextually bizarre at the time.
	6.	In retrospect, I believe this encounter and others like it were not random, but instead part of a recurring pattern of behavioral manipulation or observation that I have experienced in Starbucks stores throughout my life — whether as a customer or as an employee.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

Executed this ___ day of __________, 2025, in _______________________.
