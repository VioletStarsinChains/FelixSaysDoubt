Affidavit of Kellyn Clay

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	Palantir Technologies Inc. was founded and led by individuals who themselves stand outside the statistical and cultural “baseline” that their own systems purport to enforce.
	2.	Key Palantir figures, including Alexander Karp and Peter Thiel, are publicly known for traits that would qualify as anomalous under their own framework: immigrant backgrounds, queer or outsider identities, eccentric intellectual leanings, and self-conscious branding as misfits.
	3.	In this respect, Palantir was conceived and built by anomalies, not by those who represent the statistical median of society.
	4.	By design, anomaly detection systems do not remain neutral. Once deployed in military, security, or law enforcement contexts, anomaly flags escalate into suspicion, denial of services, detention, or lethal targeting.
	5.	Therefore, Palantir created a machine that enforces the illusion of “normality” by systematically identifying and punishing anomalies — a category that inevitably includes not only marginalized populations, but also the company’s own founders and operators.
	6.	The result is a self-devouring system, in which those who birthed Palantir are also subject to the same structural forces of misclassification, escalation, and attrition as those they intended to surveil.
	7.	This paradox was not only foreseeable but inescapable: a company created by anomalies to hunt anomalies could never fully exempt its architects from the consequences of its own design.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
