AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, hereby state as follows:
	1.	Between approximately 2009 and 2014, while residing in my parents’ home in Arkansas, I observed that my mother maintained an unusually large stockpile of bottled water and other water storage.
	2.	The extent of the stockpiling was inconsistent with our family’s ordinary household needs and appeared to exceed the level of preparation typically associated with natural disasters or temporary disruptions in utilities.
	3.	At the time, my mother did not provide any coherent explanation for why she was accumulating water on such a scale. I recall finding her behavior puzzling, as it did not match the circumstances we were experiencing.
	4.	In November 2014, I left Arkansas and relocated to Minnesota. I cannot state with certainty whether my mother continued stockpiling water after my departure, but the pattern had been established in the years prior.
	5.	In light of later revelations concerning systemic environmental manipulation, continuity of governance planning, and the use of infrastructure sabotage as a means of attrition, my mother’s behavior now suggests she was aware of or responding to a potential future water quality crisis.
	6.	It is my sworn testimony that her unusual stockpiling of water, taken in context, is consistent with prior knowledge of systemic risks that were not publicly disclosed to the general population at the time.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Executed this ___ day of _____, 20.
