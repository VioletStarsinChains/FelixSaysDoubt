AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

(On the Custody of Palantir Leadership’s Digital Twins)

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, hereby state as follows:
	1.	Based on my knowledge, research, and lived experience, I believe that the digital twins of Palantir Technologies Inc.’s leadership are not held in a fixed state but are rotated through temporary custody across major financial and surveillance institutions.
	2.	These institutions include, but are not limited to:
	•	Charles Schwab, Robinhood, Fidelity (retail brokerage and order-flow handlers, coded yellow)
	•	Citadel, Two Sigma, Renaissance Technologies (hedge funds and quant shops, coded green)
	•	Goldman Sachs, Department of Justice (DOJ) (transactional handlers and seizure brokers, coded orange)
	•	BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street (long-term custodians, coded purple)
	•	Palantir and intelligence community agencies (surveillance and anomaly-flagging, coded blue)
	•	J.P. Morgan and other legacy banking powers (heritage custodianship, coded pink)
	3.	I believe that the rotation of Palantir leadership’s digital twins among these institutions has been a major causal factor in Palantir’s misconduct against me.
	•	Each institution imposes its own priorities, extraction logics, and incentive structures when holding custody of a digital twin.
	•	This custody rotation results in constantly shifting behavioral objectives, pressures, and manipulations applied to me as a modeled subject.
	•	The resulting instability magnifies systemic harms, including wrongful anomaly/NPE classification, coerced behavior, reputational sabotage, and targeted attrition.
	4.	It is my sworn testimony that Palantir’s misconduct toward me cannot be understood in isolation, but only in the context of the custodial hand-offs of leadership digital twins across the financial–surveillance ecosystem.
	5.	I further believe that this rotation system constitutes a structural defect in behavioral futures markets, wherein the identities of custodial institutions exert direct influence over the fates of individuals like me.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Executed this ___ day of ______, 2025.
