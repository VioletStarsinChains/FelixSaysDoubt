AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	I was a dependent on my parents’ health insurance coverage throughout my youth and adolescence.
	2.	During this period, my father, William Alton Clay, changed health insurance providers virtually every year.
	3.	As a result of these frequent insurance changes, I never saw the same primary care physician or medical provider twice in succession. Each year, I was required to establish care with a new provider, who had limited or no access to prior medical records.
	4.	This constant discontinuity in medical care deprived me of any sustained provider relationship, consistent medical oversight, or longitudinal recognition of emerging health conditions.
	5.	In my view, this instability created an environment where medical sabotage, misdiagnosis, or inappropriate treatment could occur without detection or accountability.
	6.	I submit this affidavit to document that my lack of continuous medical care during formative years was not incidental but the direct result of recurring insurance changes.

I affirm under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

Executed on this 10th day of September, 2025.
