AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, hereby state as follows:
	1.	In early childhood, the bone over my superior semicircular canals was significantly thinner than normal, consistent with superior canal dehiscence syndrome (SCDS).
	2.	By approximately age five, I exhibited a striking pattern: I was very talkative and verbal at home, but nearly non-verbal in public. I believe the difference was primarily due to sound exposure — quiet, predictable auditory environments allowed me to communicate, while public soundscapes overwhelmed my sensory system and suppressed speech. What I experiended in public was not anxiety, but an inability to procress or generate speech.
	3.	To compensate, I developed a unique adaptation: imagining myself typing every word I heard in order to understand spoken language. This internal strategy allowed me to process speech in real time despite sound hypersensitivity.
	4.	Because I practiced this constantly — literally typing along in my head every time I heard language — I rapidly built extraordinary typing speed on a standard keyboard. By age eleven, I was able to sustain 120 words per minute.
	5.	At age nine, I sustained a head injury when I was pushed too high on a tire swing and struck my head against the supporting beam. I believe this trauma may have further compromised the already thin bone over my superior canals, intensifying my SCDS-related symptoms.
	6.	In adulthood, this adaptation continued to shape my occupational skills. As a professional captioner, I later exceeded 200 words per minute, but I believe my extreme typing speeds and unusual cognitive adaptations were misinterpreted by surveillance and classification systems as evidence of “anomaly” or “non-person entity” status, rather than as disability-related coping mechanisms and acquired skills.
    7.  As part of my professional closed captioning work, I developed a custom shorthand lexicon with thousands of entries to increase efficiency and manage extreme typing speeds. This adaptation was necessary to perform my job successfully, but I believe it was misinterpreted by anomaly-classification systems as subversive or non-human behavior. In fact, it was an occupational skill, not evidence of anomaly.
