AFFIDAVIT OF NON-CONSENT
I, Kellyn Clay, being of sound mind and competent legal standing, do hereby declare the following under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 U.S. Code § 1746:
	1.	I explicitly and unambiguously withdraw any and all consent—implied, coerced, assumed, inherited, or previously granted—to be included in any research, experimentation, behavioral study, cognitive simulation, neural modeling, biometric analysis, training dataset, longitudinal study, pharmacological protocol, predictive modeling system, digital twin simulation, or derivative modeling process of any kind.
	2.	This revocation applies to:
	•	Any medical, psychological, technological, behavioral, environmental, economic, or educational research or experimentation, regardless of the original sponsor, classification status, or funding source.
	•	Any use of my biological materials, biometric identifiers, neurochemical signatures, voiceprints, handwriting, genetic data, social data, or digital behavior, whether collected actively or passively.
	•	Any use of AI systems that model, simulate, predict, test, or reinforce behaviors using data derived from me or entities falsely modeled as me.
	3.	I do not consent to any ongoing or future:
	•	Collection, retention, or redistribution of my data for experimental purposes
	•	Use of my physical or digital presence as a test subject, control variable, or behavioral substrate
	•	Reenactment or simulation of my behavioral patterns under the guise of scientific inquiry, predictive analytics, or market modeling
	4.	I consider any such use of my data or likeness post-revocation to be unauthorized human experimentation, in violation of:
	•	The Nuremberg Code (1947)
	•	The Belmont Report (1979)
	•	Federal regulations under 45 CFR § 46 (Common Rule)
	•	Statutory protections against unlawful surveillance, identity misappropriation, and wire fraud
	5.	My withdrawal of consent is permanent, non-negotiable, and retroactive to the fullest extent permitted by law.
	6.	I reserve all rights to pursue civil and criminal penalties for any party found in violation of this declaration and affirm that I am acting pro se in good faith to protect my bodily autonomy, cognitive integrity, and civil rights.

Executed on this date:
9/2/2025

Respectfully submitted,
Kellyn Clay
