AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	My name is Kellyn Clay. I am over the age of eighteen and competent to make this affidavit. The statements herein are based on my personal knowledge and recollection.
	2.	Over the course of many years, I have experienced repeated, unusual, and suspicious mechanical failures and sabotage of my vehicles.
	3.	With my 2003 Toyota RAV4 (my first car):
	•	This vehicle, my first car, was originally given to me by my father, William Alton Clay, who is also named as a defendant in this case.
  • My battery repeatedly failed to hold charge. Despite taking the car to multiple repair shops, no cause could be identified. This left me frequently stranded in unsafe situations. At the time, I had untreated Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS), meaning that even a conversation with a stranger under stress could have triggered anaphylaxis.
	•	I experienced an abnormal number of flat tires, often occurring with highly suspicious timing.
	•	On one occasion, the car window was broken even though my roommate was sitting only a few feet away and should have noticed.
	4.	With my 2007 Toyota Corolla (my second car, given to me by my sister):
	•	While living in Houston, I believe the alternator was deliberately sabotaged, requiring repair. Later, two of the tires went flat at the same time.
	•	In both cases (alternator and two flats), the repair shops—completely different businesses—absorbed roughly half the repair costs themselves, as though recognizing something unusual had happened.
	•	I was told that my oil could not be changed because the screw in the oil pan had been stripped.
	5.	After receiving the Corolla, I lacked the capacity at that time to sell my RAV4 myself (it needed a new transmission). At that exact point, a man I did not know approached me on the street where the RAV4 was parked and offered to buy it from me.
	•	When I suggested I could simply drive the car to wherever he wanted it delivered, he grew evasive, saying only that “it’s kind of far away, so don’t worry.”
	•	Given the context and timing, I found this highly suspicious, and I believe it may have been connected to Palantir-related activity.
	6.	Taken together, these events suggest a consistent and suspicious pattern of vehicle sabotage, coinciding with periods of medical vulnerability and geographic relocation.
	7.	I make this affidavit to preserve the factual record of these incidents as I directly recall them. I reserve the right to supplement this statement with additional details or corroborating information if they become available.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

Executed this ___ day of __________, 2025, in _______________________.
