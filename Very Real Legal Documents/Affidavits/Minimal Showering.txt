AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, hereby add the following statement to my prior affidavit:
	1.	It is my belief that I was labeled an “anomaly” from birth due to sex chromosome differences, and that this classification directly shaped the systems of surveillance and attrition applied to me throughout my life.
	2.	As part of this targeting, I believe that chemical additives were introduced into my household water supply in ways that disproportionately affected me when showering.
	3.	From early in life, I experienced what felt like a compulsion to shower as little as possible. At the time, I could not explain why this pattern existed, as it appeared irrational when compared to cultural expectations of hygiene.
	4.	In hindsight, I recognize that this compulsion was not self-originated. Rather, it was the product of ongoing communication through a neurotechnological array, which explicitly advised me to avoid showering because of the harmful consequences of exposure.
	5.	I believe this establishes that my apparent aversion to showering was not eccentricity, but an externally mediated response to real harms stemming from my prior classification as an anomaly.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Executed this ___ day of _____, 20.
