AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, hereby state as follows:
	1.	For many years, I experienced severe brain fog and memory impairment related to my medical conditions.
	2.	During this time, I found that I could not reliably remember information unless I fully understood it. Simply being told something, without the opportunity to ask clarifying questions, meant that the information would not stay in my memory.
	3.	As a result, I developed the consistent habit of asking authority figures a large number of questions. This was not an act of defiance or subversion, but a necessary coping strategy to compensate for my medical limitations.
	4.	In multiple contexts, my questioning behavior was misinterpreted as a challenge to authority, insubordination, or intentional disruption.
	5.	I believe this misinterpretation contributed to my wrongful classification as an “anomaly” or “Non-Person Entity (NPE),” when in fact I was simply adapting to cognitive impairment caused by illness.
	6.	It is my sworn testimony that my questioning behavior was a disability accommodation strategy, not an act of resistance, and that being punished or classified for it constitutes discrimination on the basis of disability.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Executed this 9th day of September, 2025.
