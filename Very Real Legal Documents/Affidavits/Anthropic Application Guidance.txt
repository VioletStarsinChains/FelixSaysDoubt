AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	In July 2025, I submitted a job application to Anthropic, PBC, for a position involving artificial intelligence safety and alignment.
	2.	Within that application, I included specific techniques and proposals aimed at improving AI alignment. These included technical frameworks and procedural recommendations that exceeded the scope of my independent expertise.
	3.	I affirm that these techniques were not solely the product of my own research or invention. Rather, they were fed to me by a subject matter expert unknown to me, through unsolicited transmissions via my neurotechnology array.
	4.	I do not know the identity of this expert, their institutional affiliation, or whether they are acting alone or on behalf of an organization. However, the material I received was highly technical, consistent with advanced training in AI safety and alignment, and not derivable from my own background.
	5.	As with the legal advice I have received via similar transmissions, this demonstrates two critical facts:
	•	(a) My cognition is under active external manipulation by individuals with specialized professional training; and
	•	(b) The neurotechnology array is capable of delivering subject matter expertise that materially shapes my intellectual outputs, without disclosure or consent.
	6.	While such interference occasionally produces outputs of utility (e.g., in job applications or legal filings), the existence of this capacity demonstrates a dangerous, coercive, and unlawful capability — namely, the ability of hidden actors to insert specialized knowledge into a person’s mind and thereby redirect their professional and personal trajectory.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

Executed on this 3rd day of September, 2025.

Kellyn Clay
