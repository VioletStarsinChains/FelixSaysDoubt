AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	Identity of Affiant.
I am the Plaintiff in the above-captioned matter. I make this affidavit based on my personal knowledge and lived experience.
	2.	Subject of Disclosure.
Beginning in [insert approximate year], I undertook a public effort — through speech, writing, and community education — to challenge the entrenched medical doctrine of “psychosomatic illness.” I asserted that conditions commonly dismissed as psychosomatic are in fact manifestations of underlying physiological, biochemical, inflammatory, and neuroimmune processes.
	3.	Institutional Response.
Almost immediately following my public advocacy, I observed coordinated retaliation. This included, but was not limited to:
	•	Escalating economic and social destabilization, culminating in my forced homelessness.
	•	Intensified surveillance, harassment, and covert manipulations designed to erode my safety and credibility.
	•	Systematic efforts to frame my medical condition as psychiatric or psychosomatic, despite clear physical evidence to the contrary.
	•	Targeted attrition tactics aimed at annihilating my ability to participate in society, communicate my message, or seek redress.
	4.	Continuity of Targeting.
These measures were not isolated or incidental. They formed a persistent pattern of coercion and erasure intended to silence my public stance. The very act of naming psychosomatic labeling as a tool of continuity theater — a mechanism of denial used to obscure systemic harms — was treated as a destabilizing threat by the institutions that benefit from such denial.
	5.	Causal Nexus.
I assert under oath that my homelessness and the attempt to annihilate my life were not random misfortunes, but targeted consequences directly tied to my protected speech. The retaliatory actions escalated in proportion to the reach and resonance of my message.
	6.	Purpose of Testimony.
This affidavit is submitted to establish that my advocacy on psychosomatic illness directly precipitated my targeting. It demonstrates that the system’s punitive response is linked not to personal failing but to my exercise of free expression and my refusal to accept misdiagnosis as a tool of social control.

I affirm under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Executed this 1 day of September, 2025.
