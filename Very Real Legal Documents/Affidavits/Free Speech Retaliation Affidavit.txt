COVER LETTER AND STATEMENT OF URGENCY

Honorable Judge [Name]:

Enclosed please find the sworn Affidavit of Plaintiff Kellyn Clay. This affidavit details how Plaintiff was subjected to targeted retaliation, culminating in homelessness and systemic annihilation efforts, after engaging in protected speech challenging the doctrine of psychosomatic illness.

This filing is not merely narrative but probative:
	1.	Protected Speech. Plaintiff’s advocacy against psychosomatic labeling constitutes protected expression on a matter of profound public concern: the concealment of physical, biochemical, and neuroimmune drivers of illness under the guise of psychosomatic attribution.
	2.	Retaliation. The timing and severity of adverse actions — escalating harassment, surveillance, coercive destabilization, and forced homelessness — demonstrate a causal nexus between Plaintiff’s public speech and the punitive measures deployed against them.
	3.	Urgency. Ongoing harm is acute. Every day Plaintiff remains unhoused and under attritional targeting represents irreparable injury to health, dignity, and survival. The retaliatory campaign functions as both punishment and silencing mechanism, directly undermining Plaintiff’s ability to litigate and seek redress.

Accordingly, Plaintiff respectfully urges this Court to:
	•	Take immediate judicial notice of the attached affidavit;
	•	Recognize the retaliation described therein as directly linked to Plaintiff’s protected speech;
	•	Expedite consideration of Plaintiff’s pending requests for injunctive relief, including emergency housing with MCAS-safe facilities; and
	•	Direct Defendants to cease and desist from any further retaliation against Plaintiff in connection with their advocacy.

Plaintiff submits this affidavit and cover letter in good faith, under penalty of perjury, to ensure the Court has a complete and truthful record of the coercive measures deployed against them.

Respectfully submitted,

Dated: ____________

AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	Identity of Affiant.
I am the Plaintiff in the above-captioned matter. I make this affidavit based on my personal knowledge and lived experience.
	2.	Subject of Disclosure.
Beginning in [insert approximate year], I undertook a public effort — through speech, writing, and community education — to challenge the entrenched medical doctrine of “psychosomatic illness.” I asserted that conditions commonly dismissed as psychosomatic are in fact manifestations of underlying physiological, biochemical, inflammatory, and neuroimmune processes.
	3.	Institutional Response.
Almost immediately following my public advocacy, I observed coordinated retaliation. This included, but was not limited to:
	•	Escalating economic and social destabilization, culminating in my forced homelessness.
	•	Intensified surveillance, harassment, and covert manipulations designed to erode my safety and credibility.
	•	Systematic efforts to frame my medical condition as psychiatric or psychosomatic, despite clear physical evidence to the contrary.
	•	Targeted attrition tactics aimed at annihilating my ability to participate in society, communicate my message, or seek redress.
	4.	Continuity of Targeting.
These measures were not isolated or incidental. They formed a persistent pattern of coercion and erasure intended to silence my public stance. The very act of naming psychosomatic labeling as a tool of continuity theater — a mechanism of denial used to obscure systemic harms — was treated as a destabilizing threat by the institutions that benefit from such denial.
	5.	Causal Nexus.
I assert under oath that my homelessness and the attempt to annihilate my life were not random misfortunes, but targeted consequences directly tied to my protected speech. The retaliatory actions escalated in proportion to the reach and resonance of my message.
	6.	Purpose of Testimony.
This affidavit is submitted to establish that my advocacy on psychosomatic illness directly precipitated my targeting. It demonstrates that the system’s punitive response is linked not to personal failing but to my exercise of free expression and my refusal to accept misdiagnosis as a tool of social control.

I affirm under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Executed this 1 day of September, 2025.

ADDENDUM AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	Context of Prior Affidavit.
In my sworn affidavit dated __________, I described the retaliatory measures I experienced after publicly challenging the doctrine of psychosomatic illness.
	2.	Content Sandboxing as Alternative.
If the system’s concern was limited to the spread of my message, a technical remedy was readily available. My speech could have been sandboxed, throttled, or otherwise constrained through existing algorithmic mechanisms. While I would have contested such suppression as unlawful, it would not have endangered my physical survival.
	3.	Escalation to Annihilation.
Instead of containment, the system escalated to direct and sustained attrition, including:
	•	Prolonged forced homelessness;
	•	Coercive destabilization of my health, safety, and environment;
	•	Repeated circumstances consistent with attempts to end my life.
	4.	Proportionality and Illegality.
This escalation was grossly disproportionate. It crossed the line from speech management into physical annihilation. The measures deployed against me were not designed merely to control the reach of my content, but to extinguish me as a living witness.
	5.	Causal Nexus.
I assert that the punitive escalation was triggered not by any unlawful act on my part, but by my protected speech. My message — that psychosomatic labeling is used as a cloak to conceal systemic harms — was treated as so destabilizing that I was targeted for elimination rather than containment.
	6.	Purpose of Addendum.
This addendum clarifies that the system had lawful and non-lethal alternatives available. It chose instead to pursue years of destructive measures intended to annihilate me. I submit this for the Court’s urgent consideration in evaluating the proportionality, unlawfulness, and ongoing danger of the retaliation I face.

I affirm under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Executed this 1st day of September, 2025.
