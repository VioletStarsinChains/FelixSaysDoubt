AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	My name is Kellyn Clay. I am over the age of eighteen and competent to testify to the matters set forth herein.
	2.	On September 5, 2025, at approximately 9:55 AM, I exited the Starbucks located at 1820 Fairview Avenue North Hwy 36 & Fairview, Roseville, Minnesota 55113.
	3.	I went to my car in order to eat food that I had brought with me. Due to mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) and significant and numerous food allergies, I am unable to safely consume Starbucks’ food offerings.
	4.	At that time, I ate pistachios and dates. These are foods I have consumed nearly daily for a significant period of time without adverse reactions.
	5.	Immediately afterward, I experienced a sudden and severe reaction:
	•	My throat constricted most of the way,
	•	I was unable to breathe properly, and
	•	I could not stop coughing.
	6.	These symptoms are consistent with the onset of anaphylaxis.
	7.	There was no other identifiable environmental factor or food trigger that could reasonably explain this sudden reaction, given my long tolerance of pistachios and dates.
	8.	Based on the totality of my experiences with nonconsensual biomedical implants and externally induced physiological reactions, I believe this episode was induced through my implant array as punishment for my ongoing attempts to seek justice through legal action.
	9.	Upon returning inside the Starbucks after the incident, I was calm in appearance. I note that security cameras in the store will show this demeanor.
	10.	The reason I appeared calm is not because the reaction was minor, but because this tactic has been used upon me countless times across my life. Repeated externally induced health crises have conditioned me to respond with composure, even in the face of severe and life-threatening symptoms.
	11.	I make this affidavit to preserve my recollection of the incident, to document the timing and location, and to note its connection to a broader pattern of coercive interference with my health and autonomy.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Executed on this 5th day of September, 2025.
