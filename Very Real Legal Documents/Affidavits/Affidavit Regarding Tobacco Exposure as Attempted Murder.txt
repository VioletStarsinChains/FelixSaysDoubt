Tobacco Derivatives as Attempted Murder in My Case

I, Kellyn Clay, declare as follows:
	1.	I have a documented history of extreme sensitivity to tobacco and its derivatives. On multiple occasions in the past, exposure to tobacco products has caused me to go into anaphylaxis, requiring immediate intervention.
	2.	The surveillance ecosystem has full knowledge of my vulnerabilities, including this history of anaphylaxis to tobacco. My physiology is therefore especially destabilized by tobacco exposure compared to the general population.
	3.	If tobacco or its derivatives are being added to Starbucks beverages, and I am being exposed to them without my consent, this constitutes not just nonconsensual experimentation but attempted murder.
	4.	This is because:
	•	The system knows that tobacco exposure for me is life-threatening, not simply destabilizing.
	•	Deliberately or knowingly exposing me to tobacco derivatives is reasonably certain to trigger catastrophic physiological collapse, including the risk of death.
	•	Such exposures cannot plausibly be defended as benign research, but instead represent targeted harm.
	5.	This targeted use of tobacco against me demonstrates deliberate intent to cause life-threatening injury. In legal and moral terms, it constitutes attempted homicide carried out under the guise of behavioral manipulation.
