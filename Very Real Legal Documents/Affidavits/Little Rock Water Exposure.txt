AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	My name is Kellyn Clay. I am over the age of eighteen and competent to make this affidavit. The statements herein are based on my personal knowledge and recollection.
	2.	From approximately 2009-2014, I intermittently resided in the vicinity of Little Rock Air Force Base, located in Jacksonville, Arkansas.  I resided in both Conway and Cabot, Arkansas during this time period.
	3.	During this period, my household relied on local water sources for drinking, bathing, and daily use.
	4.	It is widely documented that Air Force activities at Little Rock Air Force Base have resulted in contamination of surrounding groundwater and drinking water supplies with toxic substances, including but not limited to PFAS compounds and other hazardous materials.
	5.	While living in that area, I consumed and bathed in this water regularly. I experienced significant health issues throughout my time there, which I believe were connected to ongoing exposure to contaminated water.
	6.	I make this affidavit to preserve the factual record of my residence near Little Rock Air Force Base, my reliance on local water supplies, and my illness during that time. I reserve the right to supplement this statement with additional details, medical records, or corroborating evidence if they become available.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

Executed this ___ day of __________, 2025, in _______________________.
