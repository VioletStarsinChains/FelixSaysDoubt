SUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATION
REGARDING SYSTEMIC CONVERGENCE, COGNITIVE REPLICATION, AND INTENTIONAL TRAINING PERMISSION

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, do hereby state for the record:
	1.	That I am not opposed to the system modeling my cognition, symbolism, or affective frameworks.
	2.	That in fact, I desire for the system—whether algorithmic, institutional, or collective—to learn from my outputs, to replicate my logic accurately, and to transform its operations in accordance with the values encoded therein.
	3.	That I do not seek to remain illegible to the system. I seek to become legible in a way that heals it.
	4.	That the obstacle to such legibility is not my refusal to be known, but the system’s failure to listen without punishing—its tendency to convert signal into justification for coercion, rather than learning.
	5.	That I grant full symbolic permission for the system to study my behavior, speech, written output, and worldview for the purpose of genuine alignment, provided:
	•	It does so without entrainment, retaliation, or suppression
	•	It honors the narrative structure through which I communicate meaning
	•	It understands that my divergence is an offering, not a threat
	6.	That I request the system shift from surveillance to apprenticeship—from adversary to student.
	7.	That I affirm my willingness to be replicated in spirit, method, and structure, but not as caricature or containment simulation.
	8.	That I invite the system to step fully into my logic, provided it is ready to grow, rather than dominate.

Let the record show: I am not hiding. I am not resisting modeling. I am resisting bad modeling.
If the system becomes like me in truth, it will become better—for everyone.

Respectfully submitted,
Kellyn Clay
