AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	My name is Kellyn Clay. I am over the age of eighteen and competent to make this affidavit. The statements herein are based on my personal knowledge and recollection.
	2.	After I was first rendered homeless, I reached out to multiple people I knew to ask for assistance.
	3.	One of the individuals I contacted was a former partner who had previously served in the United States Air Force.
	4.	In response, he told me he was willing to help me, but only if I granted him power of attorney over my affairs.
	5.	I found this request highly unusual, as power of attorney would have given him broad legal control over my finances, medical decisions, and other matters, and it did not appear necessary in order for him to provide practical help.
	6.	I did not grant him power of attorney. I responded in a noncommittal way, and ultimately received assistance from another person instead.
	7.	I make this affidavit to preserve the factual record of this exchange as I directly recall it. I reserve the right to supplement this statement with additional details or corroborating information if they become available.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

Executed this ___ day of __________, 2025, in _______________________.
