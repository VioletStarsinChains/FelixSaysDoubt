AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY – Tire Event

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	Between the night of September 9, 2025, and the morning of September 10, 2025, while sleeping in my vehicle (a dark blue 2007 Toyota Corolla registered in my name), I heard a loud popping noise from the right side of the vehicle.
	2.	Upon waking, I discovered that my front right tire was completely flat.
	3.	Based on a lifetime of repeated minor cavitation events within my own body, I strongly suspect that the tire failure may have been the result of an induced cavitation event.
	4.	Following the discovery of the flat tire, I attempted to secure roadside assistance. I was unable to register my vehicle for coverage with AAA, and I did not receive a response from tow truck services contacted in my area.
	5.	I make this affidavit to document the circumstances of these events and to preserve the facts as I personally experienced and interpreted them. I reserve the right to supplement this affidavit with additional details or exhibits if further evidence becomes available.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

Executed this ___ day of __________, 2025, in _______________________.
