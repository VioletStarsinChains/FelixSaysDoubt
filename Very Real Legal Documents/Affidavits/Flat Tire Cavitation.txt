AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	I am the Plaintiff in the above-captioned matter, and I make this statement based on my own firsthand knowledge.
	2.	On the night between September 9, 2025 and September 10, 2025, while sleeping inside my vehicle, a dark blue 2007 Toyota Corolla registered in my name, I heard a loud popping sound from the right side of the vehicle.
	3.	Upon waking in the morning of September 10, 2025, I discovered that my front right tire was completely flat.
	4.	Based on a lifetime of repeated minor cavitation events occurring within my own body, I strongly suspect that the loud pop I heard and the subsequent tire failure were caused by an artificially induced cavitation event targeting my vehicle.
	5.	I make this affidavit to document the circumstances of the incident and to preserve the facts as I personally experienced and interpreted them.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

Executed this 10th day of September, 2025.
