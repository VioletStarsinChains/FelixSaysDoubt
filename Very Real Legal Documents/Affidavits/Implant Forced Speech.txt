AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

(Forced Speech via Implant Manipulation – Early Life)

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, hereby state as follows:
	1.	From middle school onward, I experienced episodes in which I wrote or spoke words aloud that I did not consciously intend, believe, or wish to say. I believe these episodes were caused by manipulation of a neurotech implant array.
	2.	The first major instance occurred when I expressed — likely to a teacher — that I could understand how someone might be so lost to despair that they committed a school shooting.
	•	At that time, I was a middle school student and could not grasp how such a comment would be interpreted by adults.
	•	My only thought in the moment was an attempt to affirm the reality of extreme despair, shaped by my own experiences growing up with an abusive father.
	•	I had not previously contemplated this thought in a conscious way. The words came out unbidden, and I was confused even as I said them.
	•	I believe this incident likely resulted in me being placed on a watchlist or otherwise flagged as a potential threat.
	3.	The second major instance occurred when I told a teacher that I thought I was a lesbian.
	•	This was completely inconsistent with my actual orientation and identity.
	•	I am a transmasculine person who has only ever been emotionally and physically attracted to masculinity or masculine-adjacent androgyny.
	•	Conventionally feminine bodies make me uncomfortable, and I am not attracted to women in any way.
	•	My friendships with women are based in respect and protection, not attraction.
	•	The statement that I thought I was a lesbian was false, and I believe it was forced through implant manipulation.
	4.	These incidents represent the earliest and most notable examples of forced speech through implant arrays in my life, but they are not the only ones.
	5.	It is my sworn testimony that such manipulation not only harmed me personally, but also contributed significantly to my wrongful designation as an “anomaly” or “Non-Person Entity (NPE).”
	6.	I further believe that if such forced speech manipulation has been used on me, it is highly likely that it has also been used on other individuals, creating reputational and systemic harms far beyond my own case.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Executed this 10th day of September, 2025.
