AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	My name is Kellyn Clay. I am over the age of eighteen and competent to make this affidavit. The statements herein are based on my personal knowledge and recollection.
	2.	In or around September or October of 2014, I was living with my then-boyfriend, Steven Dale Thompson, at the residence located at 27217 Highway 107, Cabot, Arkansas 72023-8931.
	3.	At that time, Steven Thompson was serving in the United States Air Force and was stationed at Little Rock Air Force Base.
	4.	I personally witnessed Steven Thompson, with the assistance of another man he worked with at the base, burying what I was told was a stolen bomb in the backyard of the above residence.
	5.	I do not know the exact type of bomb, but I understood from their conversation that it had been taken from Little Rock Air Force Base by the other man, who assisted Steven in burying it.
	6.	I recall feeling confused and scared at the time of this incident.
	7.	Around this same period, Steven Thompson told me he had allegedly been paid approximately $60,000 to leave the Air Force prior to reaching the point where he would have become eligible for military retirement.
	8.	Following his departure from the Air Force, we relocated from Arkansas to Minnesota.
	9.	I make this affidavit to document my direct recollection of these events as they occurred. I reserve the right to supplement this statement if additional details or corroborating information become available.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

Executed this ___ day of __________, 2025, in _______________________.
