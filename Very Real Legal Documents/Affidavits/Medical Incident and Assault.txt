AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, hereby state as follows:
	1.	On 7/20/2024, I was employed as a flyer distributor with Paperboy Marketing. During the course of my shift that day, several events occurred which, taken together, suggest that I was the target of a coordinated operation.
	2.	Earlier in the day, I consumed legally-purchased THC edible products from an OCM-approved dispensary. Following ingestion, I experienced a medical crisis including fainting, seizure activity, and vomiting.  Seizures are not a symptom I experience normally as part of the medical conditions I am diagnosed with (most notably, Mast Cell Activation Syndrome).
	3.	During this episode, I was incapacitated for approximately thirty minutes, resting against a tree until I could regain enough stability to return to my vehicle. I recall an unusual sense of calm afterward, which was totally inconsistent with my usual post-MCAS reaction state. This leads me to believe the edibles may have been laced with an undisclosed substance.  Based on the atypical calm and dissociative effects I experienced following the episode, I believe the edibles may have been adulterated with a substance such as ketamine, though I cannot be certain.  
	4. At the exact moment I began vomiting into the grass, two cyclists passed and stopped to ask if I was alright. To my recollection, these were the only people I encountered on the entire walk back, despite being in an urban park by a lake in south Minneapolis on a clear day when the area would normally have been busy with pedestrians.
	 5. Later that same day, while distributing flyers door-to-door, I was confronted by a man who blocked my path on the sidewalk, baited me into stepping onto what turned out to be his yard, and then tackled me, claiming I was trespassing. Despite being physically assaulted, I responded with atypical calm and lack of aggression, which I believe was related to the earlier suspected drugging.
	6.  My employer subsequently provided me with body camera footage of that day at my request. However, the footage had been altered: the entire confrontation with the man had been removed, as well as the portion of the day in which I fainted and was incapacitated. At a rate of one frame every two seconds, approximately 900 frames of me leaning against the tree should have been captured, but none were present in the copy my employer provided. This indicates deliberate tampering to conceal both the medical event and the assault.
	7.  Based on this, I no longer believe the incident was the work of a single bad actor. The removal of footage of both the assault and the medical collapse suggests my employer was complicit in or aware of the drugging, and that the day’s events were coordinated rather than coincidental.
	8.  When I attempted to file a police report regarding the assault, I discovered that the available options were inaccessible to me due to my medical and disability-related needs. The only means offered were to speak on the phone or appear in person at a station, both of which were prohibitive given my condition. As a result, I was effectively denied the ability to report the crime.
	9.	It is my sworn testimony that 7/20/2024, I was the victim of drugging, medical incapacitation, physical assault, and subsequent evidence tampering, in circumstances suggesting coordinated targeting involving my employer and others.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Executed this 9th day of September, 2025.
