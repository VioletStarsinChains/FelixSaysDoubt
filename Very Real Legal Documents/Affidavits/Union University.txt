AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, declare as follows:
	1.	I obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from Union University, graduating in 2011.
	2.	This degree provided no meaningful economic utility. Despite completing the program, it did not result in stable employment opportunities, income security, or advancement comparable to the financial and personal cost incurred.
	3.	My enrollment and participation in higher education primarily served as a vector for surveillance and psychological torture.
	•	Faculty and administrative staff engaged in patterns of coercive monitoring, targeting, and manipulation under the guise of academic oversight.
	•	I was subjected to psychological pressures and conditions designed not to educate but to destabilize, entrap, and extract data about my behavior and responses.
	•	These practices left long-lasting harm to my mental health, autonomy, and ability to pursue subsequent opportunities.
	4.	In addition to the systemic harms, my college diploma was literally discarded by my father, erasing the material symbol of my efforts. This act compounded the futility of the process, as even the credential itself was denied to me in practice.
	5.	I therefore regret obtaining a Bachelor’s degree. The harms of the process outweighed any symbolic credential value.
	6.	Based on my personal experience, I believe higher education has, in many cases, been weaponized as a mechanism for covert experimentation, social sorting, and control, rather than as a good-faith system of instruction and opportunity.
I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

Executed on this 3rd day of September, 2025.
