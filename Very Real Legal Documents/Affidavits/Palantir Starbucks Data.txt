AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, state the following under oath:
	1.	For several years, while experiencing homelessness, I consumed Starbucks beverages on a daily basis, often brewed via the Clover system.
	2.	During this period, I frequently experienced severe emotional dysregulation and cognitive impairment shortly after consuming these beverages. These episodes led me to make statements on social media, including posts on my Twitter/X account @dysautonomian, that I would not otherwise have made if I had been in my baseline state.
	3.	The timing of these episodes, combined with withdrawal symptoms not explained by caffeine alone, strongly suggests that my Starbucks beverages contained undisclosed additives or chemical exposures beyond caffeine.
	4.	Any statements I made on social media during these periods were chemically influenced, impaired, and not representative of my true beliefs, values, or intentions.
	5.	Despite this, I have reason to believe that Palantir Technologies Inc. ingested, analyzed, and disseminated my social media statements as if they were authentic self-expression.
	6.	I never gave consent for Palantir—or any government agency, contractor, or private entity—to treat chemically influenced social media statements as accurate reflections of my true beliefs, values, or intentions.
	7.	Any such classification constitutes a misrepresentation of my identity and an infringement on my civil rights, particularly given that my statements arose in the context of severe medical disability.
	8.	It is my sworn testimony that while my chemically influenced statements sometimes appeared aggressive, I always remained within legal confines and social norms in my actual behaviors. I never engaged in violence, unlawful activity, or physical disruption.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Executed this ___ day of _____, 2025.
