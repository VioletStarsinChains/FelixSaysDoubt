Affidavit of Kellyn Clay — Restroom Lock Incident in Cancún

I, Kellyn Clay, declare the following under penalty of perjury:
	1.	As a child, I traveled with my family on a vacation to Cancún, Mexico.
	2.	During that trip, we dined at a large and upscale restaurant located in a developed part of Cancún.
	3.	When I needed to use the restroom, I was directed to a facility that was detached from the main restaurant building and required a significant walk from the dining area.
	4.	After using the restroom, I found that the door would not unlock. I attempted multiple times to open it, but nothing I did released the lock.
	5.	I was trapped inside the restroom for approximately fifteen (15) minutes.
	6.	At a certain point, the door suddenly unlocked on its own without any intervention on my part.
	7.	I was then able to leave the restroom and return to my family.
	8.	This incident was unusual and alarming, given that the restaurant was otherwise upscale and located in a developed area where restroom facilities would normally be expected to function properly.
	9.	I do not know the cause of the malfunction. I can only affirm that I was locked inside and unable to exit for approximately fifteen minutes until the door released itself.

I affirm that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
