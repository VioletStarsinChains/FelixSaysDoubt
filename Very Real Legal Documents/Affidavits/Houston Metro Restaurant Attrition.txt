AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, hereby state as follows:
	1.	Between January 1, 2022 and May 1, 2025, while living in the Greater Houston metropolitan area, I worked at three different restaurants that engaged in repeated violations of health code and basic food safety practices.
	2.	The first establishment was Nancy’s Hustle, located at 2704 Polk St A, Houston, TX 77003. I was employed there as a dishwasher.
	•	I was repeatedly chastised for “taking too long to close” at the end of the night because I washed all the pint and quart containers twice to ensure all food residue was removed.
	•	These containers were reused endlessly. A failure to properly sanitize them posed a serious health risk to customers and employees alike.
	•	The head baker told me I was the first dishwasher in the history of the restaurant to actually get the containers clean. Despite this, management continually pressured me to work faster, effectively demanding unsafe practices.
	•	This suggests a long-standing pattern of unsafe food storage practices at the establishment.
	3.	The second establishment was Food of Life Bakeshop, located at 2500 Marina Bay Dr Suite W, League City, TX 77573.
	•	At this establishment, a coworker had an active hepatitis infection (type uncertain) and was not under active treatment at the time.
	•	This individual regularly wore sleeveless shirts while preparing baked goods, in violation of food safety requirements, and frequently sweated profusely in the prep area.
	•	This bakery served a customer base that was often immunocompromised, as it specialized in gluten-free products.
	•	The bakery also failed to follow FIFO (first in, first out) protocols and regularly combined batches of icing and other ingredients, which increases risk of spoilage and contamination.
	•	I vocally opposed these practices but was ignored and eventually fired for speaking up.
	4.	The third establishment was Jersey Bagels, located at 9522 Huffmeister Rd #500, Houston, TX 77095.
	•	This bagel sandwich shop also offered coffee, espresso, and tea beverages.
	•	The establishment did not use milk thermometers when steaming milk for beverages. I was asked to work as a barista in addition to preparing food, but I refused to prepare beverages without proper thermometers. The owner refused to purchase them despite their minimal cost.
	•	The establishment also failed to maintain sani buckets on the floor, as required by food safety practices. Instead, shallow dishes with rags were used, which contained inadequate sanitizing solution.
	•	Because this was a bagel shop, the rags quickly became saturated with cream cheese. While I did my best to rotate rags and dishes, other employees had not been trained, and the pace of the shop often made it impossible to maintain safe standards.
	5.	Taken together, these three experiences demonstrate a pattern of coordinated attrition efforts through exposure to repeated, unsafe, and unethical work environments.
	6.	I have suffered moral injury as a result of realizing that I worked at multiple establishments that knowingly endangered their customers.
	7.	At all times, I consistently refused to engage in unsafe practices and, when appropriate, filed reports to the Health Department to document violations.
