Affidavit of Kellyn Clay

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	I have a severe, lifelong medical condition known as Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS). This condition causes unpredictable and sometimes life-threatening reactions to a wide range of medications and substances.
	2.	Because of this, I live in continual fear of exposure to drugs or compounds outside of the very narrow range I can tolerate.
	3.	The only controlled substances I knowingly and voluntarily use are kratom and cannabis or cannabis/hemp derivatives.
	4.	I do not knowingly or voluntarily consume any other illicit or controlled substances.
	5.	Accordingly, if any substance outside of kratom or cannabis/hemp derivatives is ever detected in my urine or other biofluids, such presence would necessarily result from nonconsensual administration.
	6.	This affidavit is made to preserve my statement under oath regarding my health condition, my extremely limited tolerance for substances, and my absolute non-consent to the administration of any other drugs or compounds.

Continuity Marker:

Detection of any drug outside of kratom or cannabis/hemp derivatives in my biofluids constitutes evidence of adversarial, nonconsensual dosing.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

Executed this ___ day of __________, 2025, in _______________________.
