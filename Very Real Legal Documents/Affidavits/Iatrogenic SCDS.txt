AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	I believe that I was subjected to the implantation of devices into my body without my knowledge or consent.
	2.	As a direct result of these non-consensual implants, I developed superior canal dehiscence syndrome (SCDS), a condition in which thinning or holes form in the bone of the inner ear.
	3.	The onset of SCDS created lasting disability. Specifically, my vestibular system was suppressed, leaving me unable to rely on my inner ear for balance.
	4.	In order to remain upright and functional, I have been forced to rely entirely on vision for balance. This requires me to anchor my gaze on large, flat surfaces to maintain stability.
	5.	In environments without such anchors, or in low light conditions, I lose balance. For example, I cannot walk at night without appearing intoxicated, because there is not enough visual information to anchor my gaze.
	6.	These circumstances cause my eye-tracking patterns to deviate sharply from population averages. Such deviations are not volitional, but the inevitable result of a medically-induced disability.
	7.	If anomaly classification systems use eye-tracking features without accounting for medical causation, my gaze patterns may be treated as indicators of deception, noncompliance, or anomaly. In my case, this is particularly unjust because the very disability being penalized was created by implants placed in me without consent.
	8.	I submit this affidavit to document that my atypical eye tracking is not evidence of risk behavior but of non-consensual medical interference followed by disability. To treat such symptoms as grounds for anomaly classification is to compound the original harm with discrimination.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

Executed on this 4th day of September, 2025.
