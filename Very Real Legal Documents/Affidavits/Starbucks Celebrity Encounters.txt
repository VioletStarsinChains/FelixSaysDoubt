Affidavit of Kellyn Clay

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, depose and state as follows:
	1.	In 2011, I was employed as a barista at a Starbucks located on Interstate 40 between Memphis and Nashville (12 Stonebridge Blvd, Jackson, TN 38305). At the time, this was the only Starbucks along that interstate corridor.
	2.	Because of this location, it was geographically plausible that touring musicians traveling by highway would stop at the store.
	3.	During my employment, I observed multiple celebrities in the store, including members of The Flaming Lips and musician Chad VanGaalen. I was also informed that Taylor Swift had visited the store shortly before I was hired.
	4.	I also observed multiple professors from the university I attended frequenting the store in a manner that seemed unusually timed or staged to provoke me.
	5.	What makes these encounters suspicious is the pattern of priming immediately beforehand:
	•	Only weeks before members of The Flaming Lips appeared at the store, multiple people in my life encouraged me to listen to their music. I had heard the name but had never previously engaged with their work.
	•	Similarly, when Chad VanGaalen appeared at the store, I had only recently been introduced to his music and likely had his CD in my car player at the very moment he visited.
	6.	In retrospect, I believe these encounters were not merely coincidental but instead part of a recurring pattern of engineered exposures and behavioral testing designed to observe or provoke my reactions.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.

Executed this ___ day of __________, 2025, in _______________________.
