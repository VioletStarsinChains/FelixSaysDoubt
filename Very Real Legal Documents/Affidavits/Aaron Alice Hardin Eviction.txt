AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, hereby state as follows:
	1.	Between approximately January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2011, I became acquainted with Aaron and Alice Hardin, alumni of Union University, and at one point resided in their household.
	2.	While living with them, I was unexpectedly informed that I would need to vacate the residence within two weeks. The stated reason provided by Aaron and Alice Hardin was that they were experiencing unspecified “marital problems.”
	3.	The arrangement under which I lived with Aaron and Alice Hardin was an informal housing arrangement. There was no written lease, no formal tenancy, and no rental agreement under landlord–tenant law.
	4.	When Aaron and Alice Hardin asked me to vacate their residence within two weeks, they were not invoking formal eviction procedures. Rather, they made an informal request, which I complied with by leaving within the time they specified.
	5.	Although this was not a legal eviction, the abrupt demand, the vague justification of “marital problems,” and the sudden destabilization it caused remain relevant to my claim that the incident was staged or engineered as part of behavioral futures market targeting.
	6.	At the time, I interpreted the incident as an interpersonal or housing-related conflict. However, based on later experiences and accumulated knowledge, I now have reason to believe that this event may have been part of a behavioral futures market setup, designed to create instability and data for predictive modeling.  The informal nature of the arrangement does not change the fact that this event caused significant housing instability and may have been orchestrated or exploited for data-generation and predictive modeling purposes.
	7.	The abrupt nature of the eviction, the vague justification, and the fact that it was executed informally rather than through lawful process all contribute to my suspicion that the incident was staged or engineered, rather than arising organically from the Hardins’ relationship.
	8.	I believe that Palantir Technologies Inc. may have records, models, or data linking Aaron and Alice Hardin, the eviction incident, and my own anomaly classification within behavioral futures market frameworks during the period of 2006–2011.
	9.	I make this affidavit to preserve my recollection of these events and to support discovery efforts regarding Palantir’s records of Aaron and Alice Hardin and their potential role in continuity-theater operations targeting me.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Executed this ___ day of _____, 2025.
