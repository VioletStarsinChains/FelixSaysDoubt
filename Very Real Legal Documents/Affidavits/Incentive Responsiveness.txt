AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, hereby state as follows:
	1.	For the majority of my life, I have lived with the effects of untreated superior canal dehiscence syndrome (SCDS), mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), and hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (hEDS).
	2.	These conditions have caused me to experience extreme, lifelong fatigue as well as severe physical symptoms when exposed to many common foods, medications, or environmental triggers.
	3.	Because of this, I found that traditional incentive structures — including rewards tied to food, money, social status, or consumer opportunities — were either harmful or irrelevant to me.
	•	Many “rewards” offered in school, work, or social environments (e.g., pizza parties, snacks, alcohol, stimulants) would make me violently ill due to MCAS and exposure to environmental and dietary triggers.
	•	Other incentives, such as entertainment, travel, or consumer goods, were functionally useless to me because of my overwhelming fatigue and inability to participate fully.
	•	Social rewards, such as group belonging, recognition, or popularity, had the least to offer me. My symptoms made it difficult to sustain participation in group activities or relationships, and social settings often added sensory and inflammatory stress rather than relief.
	4.	Over time, I learned to disregard traditional incentive structures entirely, not out of defiance, but because they had no meaning or value in the context of my lived experience with severe illness.
	5.	I believe this adaptive stance contributed significantly to my wrongful designation as an “anomaly” or “Non-Person Entity (NPE).”
	•	Systems designed to model or classify behavior likely interpreted my disregard for incentives as noncompliance, subversion, or lack of integration with normative structures.
	•	In reality, my behavior was a direct consequence of untreated medical conditions that rendered traditional rewards harmful or useless.
	6.	It is my sworn testimony that my divergence from incentive-driven behavior should not have been treated as evidence of anomaly status. It was a predictable, disability-related adaptation to chronic illness and fatigue.

I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

Executed this 10th day of September, 2025.
