Affidavit of Kellyn Clay — Forced Exposure to Grooming Media

I, Kellyn Clay, declare the following under penalty of perjury:
	1.	During my childhood, my mother directed me to read a particular children’s book series.
	2.	The series centered on a young girl who was adopted by a much older man, whom she later went on to marry.
	3.	I did not select these books for myself; they were imposed upon me by my mother. At the time, I did not have the capacity to critically evaluate or reject their content.
	4.	This exposure was profoundly disturbing given my family context, including the possibility that my father was not my biological father.
	5.	In retrospect, the narrative of adoption leading to marriage to an older authority figure appears designed to normalize exploitation and blur boundaries between caretaking and sexual relationships.
	6.	In addition, my parents never provided me with a conversation about sex, reproduction, or healthy relationships (“the talk”). Instead, my mother gave me a romance novel in which the only intimate encounter depicted was clearly nonconsensual.
	7.	This substitution further groomed me by normalizing abuse, framing sexual violence as the central or expected form of intimacy, and denying me access to age-appropriate, truthful education.
	8.	I believe these exposures were part of a deliberate pattern of symbolic and narrative conditioning, alongside other forced exposures (e.g., Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, The Diary of Anne Frank), to shape my psychological expectations of enslavement, captivity, betrayal, and exploitation.

I affirm that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge.
