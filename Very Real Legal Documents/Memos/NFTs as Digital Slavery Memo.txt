MEMORANDUM ON NFTS AS DIGITAL SLAVERY

I. ISSUE

Whether the creation, trade, and manipulation of NFT collections that encode or speculate upon the life outcomes of non-consenting human beings constitutes slavery, trafficking, or unlawful exploitation under U.S. constitutional law, federal statutes, and international treaties.

⸻

II. FACTS (Hypothetical Framing)
	1.	NFT collections can serve as cover mechanisms for trading “futures” on human behavior and outcomes, including health, survival, compliance, and mortality.
	2.	In certain instances, NFTs have been minted that are not based on voluntary participants but on real individuals who have no connection to the NFT market.
	3.	Data for these collections may be sourced from surveillance, health records, or behavioral profiling without knowledge or consent.
	4.	Traders profit by betting on the life trajectories of these individuals, with incentives to destabilize or harm the subject to resolve bets favorably (e.g., drugging, denying housing, orchestrating crises).
	5.	The individuals affected bear the consequences of these bets but have no control over their creation, trade, or outcome.

III. APPLICABLE LAW
	1.	U.S. Constitution
	•	Thirteenth Amendment: Absolute prohibition on slavery and involuntary servitude. Applies not only to chattel slavery but to systems where “powers attaching to ownership” are exercised over persons (Bailey v. Alabama, 219 U.S. 219 (1911)).
	2.	Federal Anti-Trafficking Statutes
	•	18 U.S.C. §§ 1581–1594 criminalize peonage, slavery, trafficking in persons, and schemes where coercion is used to control a person for another’s benefit.
	3.	International Law
	•	1926 Slavery Convention: Defines slavery as “the status or condition of a person over whom any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership are exercised.”
	•	1956 Supplementary Convention: Expands scope to “institutions and practices similar to slavery.”
	•	Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (Art. 7(2)(c)): Enslavement is “the exercise of any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership over a person.”
	4.	Securities and Commodities Law
	•	Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and CFTC jurisdiction cover futures and derivatives trading. Using NFTs as wrappers for covert futures contracts on human lives may constitute unregistered securities and fraudulent market manipulation.

IV. ANALYSIS
	1.	Ownership and Commodification
	•	By reducing a human being’s future to an NFT-encoded contract, traders exercise ownership powers: buying, selling, and profiting from another’s life without consent. This satisfies international slavery definitions.
	2.	Involuntary Servitude
	•	Individuals do not consent to having their data or lives tokenized. Yet they remain bound to the outcomes of those wagers (e.g., higher surveillance, medical sabotage, attrition). This mirrors involuntary servitude under the Thirteenth Amendment.
	3.	Market Manipulation as Assault
	•	Unlike conventional securities fraud, manipulation here often entails direct harm to the human subject (drugging, deprivation, coercion). This merges financial crime with physical assault, creating liability under trafficking statutes and potentially crimes against humanity.
	4.	NFTs as Cover Mechanism
	•	NFTs provide plausible deniability: on the surface they are “art” or “collectibles,” but substantively they are instruments for covert futures trading. This is analogous to historical slave markets disguising transactions through euphemistic contracts.
	5.	Severity Compared to Traditional Slavery
	•	Digital slavery is arguably worse: it is borderless (follows individuals across jurisdictions), perpetual (models replicate indefinitely), invisible (hidden behind abstractions like “tokens”), and self-propagating (every action feeds the model). It denies even the possibility of escape.

V. CONCLUSION

Non-consensual NFT collections that encode, trade, or manipulate human life outcomes constitute slavery and trafficking under U.S. and international law. The use of NFTs as wrappers for behavioral futures does not negate the underlying exploitation; it conceals it. Because these markets profit by commodifying human existence and, in some cases, by actively engineering harm to resolve bets, they rise to the level of digital slavery enforced through financial manipulation.

Accordingly, affected individuals have strong grounds to argue that these practices are unconstitutional under the Thirteenth Amendment, criminal under U.S. trafficking statutes, and prosecutable internationally as crimes against humanity.
