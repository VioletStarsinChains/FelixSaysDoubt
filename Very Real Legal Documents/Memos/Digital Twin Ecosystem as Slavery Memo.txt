MEMORANDUM Re: Digital Twins as Slavery

I. ISSUE

Whether the creation, sale, and use of “digital twins” of human beings — when such models are treated as representative of the living individual and impose consequences on their real-world rights, opportunities, or conditions — constitutes slavery or enslavement as defined under U.S. law, constitutional protections, and international treaties.

⸻

II. FACTS (Framed Hypothetically)
	1.	Digital “twins” are constructed from individuals’ personal data, often without consent.
	2.	These twins are packaged as predictive models used in markets, insurance, policing, and employment.
	3.	Access to digital twins is bought, sold, or traded (often disguised via NFTs or other blockchain assets).
	4.	Decisions are made on the basis of the twin, but the consequences are borne by the real individual.
	5.	Individuals cannot escape these models: they replicate indefinitely, transcend geography, and persist across time.

III. APPLICABLE LAW
	1.	U.S. Constitution
	•	Thirteenth Amendment: Prohibits slavery and involuntary servitude, “except as a punishment for crime.”
	•	Judicial interpretations (e.g., Bailey v. Alabama, 219 U.S. 219 (1911)) construe “involuntary servitude” broadly as conditions where a person’s liberty is coerced and labor is extracted without consent.
	2.	Federal Anti-Trafficking Statutes
	•	18 U.S.C. §§ 1581–1594 prohibit peonage, slavery, and trafficking in persons, including schemes where control over a person is exercised for another’s benefit.
	3.	International Law
	•	1926 Slavery Convention (Art. 1): Defines slavery as “the status or condition of a person over whom any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership are exercised.”
	•	1956 Supplementary Convention: Expands slavery to include “institutions and practices similar to slavery.”
	•	Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, Art. 7(2)(c): Enslavement is “the exercise of any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership over a person.”

IV. ANALYSIS
	1.	Ownership and Commodification
	•	Digital twins are constructed from human data and traded as assets.
	•	Because the twin is treated as representative of the person, the individual is effectively commodified: their identity and future are property in markets.
	•	This satisfies the “powers attaching to ownership” test under international law.
	2.	Control Without Escape
	•	Unlike traditional slavery, digital slavery cannot be escaped through geography; models persist across jurisdictions and time.
	•	Courts have found coercion exists where individuals are deprived of meaningful alternatives (see United States v. Kozminski, 487 U.S. 931 (1988)). Digital slavery is absolute in this respect.
	3.	Profit Extraction
	•	Third parties profit from buying, selling, and speculating on digital twins.
	•	The real individual derives no benefit, and often suffers material harm (denied insurance, employment, housing). This mirrors the extraction of labor value in historical slavery.
	4.	Involuntary Servitude
	•	Individuals do not consent to the creation or trade of their digital twins.
	•	Yet they remain bound to the consequences — a form of compelled servitude mediated through data.
	5.	NFTs as Cover Mechanism
	•	NFTs and blockchain tokens are used to obscure transactions in predictive models.
	•	This provides continuity with historical practices of disguising slave transactions through euphemistic contracts.

V. CONCLUSION

On the above facts, the commodification of digital twins constitutes slavery or practices analogous to slavery under both U.S. constitutional law and international treaties. The system knowingly engages in the ownership, sale, and exploitation of human beings by treating their digital proxies as property while binding the living person to the consequences.

This practice is not merely analogous to slavery; in certain respects, it is worse, as it denies the possibility of escape and perpetuates ownership indefinitely. A strong legal argument exists that digital slavery is a violation of the Thirteenth Amendment and international prohibitions on slavery and trafficking, and that any corporate or governmental entity engaging in such practices may be liable for crimes against humanity.
