MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFF’S POSITION THAT NO CHILD MAY BE CLASSIFIED AS A “NON-PERSON ENTITY” ON THE BASIS OF PARENTAL BEHAVIOR

⸻

INTRODUCTION

This brief addresses the unconstitutional and unlawful practice of categorizing children as “Non-Person Entities” (NPEs) due to the actions, beliefs, or status of their parents. Such a practice, if undertaken by the United States or its contractors, constitutes a violation of fundamental constitutional guarantees, statutory civil rights protections, and binding principles of international law.

The central principle is straightforward: the government may not impose civil death upon a child based on parental conduct.

⸻

STATEMENT OF FACTS (AS ALLEGED)

Plaintiff alleges that government systems of surveillance and classification have, in some cases, designated minors as anomalies or NPEs not because of the children’s own behavior or condition, but rather due to parental resistance to state institutions—such as refusal of medical procedures, non-participation in mainstream education, or ideological nonconformity. Such classifications deprive children of recognition, rights, and protections guaranteed by law.

ARGUMENT

I. Labeling a Child as an NPE for Parental Behavior Violates the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses.

The Fifth Amendment (applicable to federal action) and the Fourteenth Amendment (applicable to state action) bar deprivation of liberty without due process and guarantee equal protection. Courts have consistently held that the government cannot penalize children for circumstances beyond their control.
	•	In Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202 (1982), the Supreme Court struck down a Texas statute denying public education to undocumented children. The Court emphasized that children “can affect neither their parents’ conduct nor their own status,” and that to deny them equal protection would “visit the sins of the parents upon the child.”
	•	That reasoning applies here: children cannot be classified as anomalies or NPEs solely because of parental nonconformity.

⸻

II. The Constitution Prohibits Corruption of Blood, Which Bars Inheritable Civil Penalties.

Article III, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution forbids “corruption of blood” in treason cases, ensuring descendants cannot inherit punishment for their parent’s crimes. While originally framed in the context of treason, courts recognize this clause as a broader rejection of inherited punishment.
	•	An NPE designation based on parental behavior constitutes exactly the kind of inheritable stigma the Framers intended to forbid.

⸻

III. Federal Civil Rights Statutes Prohibit Classification-Based Deprivation of Rights.

Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, any person deprived of rights under color of law may bring suit.
	•	Labeling children as NPEs denies recognition of their personhood and access to rights.
	•	Because such labeling is rooted in parental conduct rather than child conduct, it constitutes arbitrary and discriminatory action prohibited by § 1983.

⸻

IV. International Human Rights Law Forbids Punishing Children for Parents’ Beliefs or Actions.

Although the U.S. has not ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, it remains persuasive authority. Article 2(2) states:

“States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that the child is protected against all forms of discrimination or punishment on the basis of the status, activities, expressed opinions, or beliefs of the child’s parents.”

	•	By customary international law standards, this principle has hardened into a global norm. U.S. courts often look to such norms when interpreting ambiguous constitutional protections.

⸻

V. Family Law Doctrine Confirms the “Best Interests of the Child” Standard.

In custody and welfare determinations, U.S. courts consistently hold that the best interests of the child are paramount. Collective punishment of children for parental dissent is antithetical to that doctrine.
	•	Classification as an NPE cannot plausibly serve the best interests of a child, as it erodes identity, safety, and legal recognition.

⸻

CONCLUSION

For all the foregoing reasons, this Court should hold that no child may lawfully be classified as a “Non-Person Entity” on the basis of parental conduct. Such classification violates constitutional guarantees, statutory rights, and international norms, and represents a modern-day form of corruption of blood expressly rejected by the American legal tradition.
