MEMORANDUM OF LAW REGARDING CREDIT CARD DEBT AND NPE CLASSIFICATION

⸻

INTRODUCTION

Plaintiff respectfully submits this memorandum to address the issue of liability for credit card debt in the context of alleged classification as a “Non-Person Entity” (NPE). If Plaintiff lacked legal personhood during the creation of accounts or obligations, any purported debts attributed to Plaintiff are unenforceable. Further, such unenforceable obligations cannot lawfully be used to deny housing, financing, or other essential services.

⸻

STATEMENT OF FACTS
	1.	Plaintiff’s father, while employed at Deloitte and consulting for Bank of America, allegedly established joint or custodial accounts under Plaintiff’s name, obscuring Plaintiff’s NPE classification.
	2.	Plaintiff did not knowingly or voluntarily assume contractual liability for credit card debts associated with those accounts.
	3.	Defendants nonetheless reported such debts as belonging to Plaintiff, impairing Plaintiff’s ability to secure housing.

LEGAL ISSUE

Whether credit card debt allegedly accrued under Plaintiff’s name can be enforceable, and whether such unenforceable debt may be used as justification for denial of housing or related opportunities.

⸻

ARGUMENT

I. Lack of Capacity Renders Contracts Void or Voidable
A. In contract law, capacity is a prerequisite to enforceability. Just as minors or persons deemed incompetent cannot be held to binding credit agreements, an individual classified as a NPE lacks the recognized legal personhood necessary to form enforceable contracts.
B. Any credit card agreements attributed to Plaintiff are thus void ab initio or, at minimum, voidable.

II. Fraudulent Inducement and Bank Participation
A. Plaintiff’s father, with apparent complicity by Bank of America, allegedly obscured Plaintiff’s classification in order to create the illusion of enforceable liability.
B. To the extent Defendants knowingly created or facilitated accounts under false pretenses, liability properly rests with them, not Plaintiff.

III. Fair Housing and Equal Protection Principles Prohibit Reliance on Invalid Debt
A. Even if debts were erroneously reported under Plaintiff’s name, their unenforceability means they cannot be considered legitimate grounds for denial of housing or credit.
B. Using fabricated or misattributed obligations as justification for exclusion constitutes unlawful discrimination and deprivation of rights.

⸻

CONCLUSION

Because Plaintiff was classified as a NPE at the time of account creation, Plaintiff lacked the legal capacity to incur binding credit obligations. Liability for any such debts falls to the responsible parent, institution, or contractor—not Plaintiff. Accordingly, these debts cannot lawfully be used to justify housing denial, credit exclusion, or other systemic deprivations.

Respectfully submitted,
