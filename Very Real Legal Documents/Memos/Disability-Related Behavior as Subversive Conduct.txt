MEMORANDUM ON DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION VIA MISINTERPRETATION OF ADAPTIVE QUESTIONING

To: File
From: Plaintiff, Kellyn Clay (Pro Se)
Re: Misclassification of disability-related behavior as “subversive” conduct

⸻

Issue

Whether Plaintiff’s habit of asking authority figures extensive clarifying questions, as an adaptive strategy for severe brain fog and memory impairment, was wrongly interpreted as defiance or subversion, leading to anomaly/NPE classification and subsequent harms.

⸻

Facts
	•	Plaintiff experienced prolonged cognitive impairment, including severe brain fog and memory problems.
	•	To retain information, Plaintiff consistently asked clarifying questions of supervisors, instructors, or authority figures. Without this process, Plaintiff could not reliably remember instructions or information.
	•	This questioning behavior was not rooted in disobedience but in medical necessity.
	•	Authority figures repeatedly misinterpreted this behavior as oppositional, insubordinate, or subversive.
	•	Plaintiff was subsequently subjected to adverse classification and treatment, including designation as an “anomaly” or “Non-Person Entity (NPE).”

⸻

Applicable Law
	•	Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability, including neurological or cognitive impairments.
	•	The ADA requires that reasonable accommodations be made for individuals whose disabilities affect communication, memory, or comprehension.
	•	Disability-related behaviors may not be used as the basis for adverse action when such behaviors are direct manifestations of the disability.
	•	The ADA recognizes that differential treatment based on misinterpretation of disability-related conduct constitutes unlawful discrimination.

⸻

Analysis

Plaintiff’s questioning behavior was:
	1.	Directly tied to disability: Asking questions was a coping strategy to mitigate memory impairment caused by brain fog.
	2.	Consistently misinterpreted: Authority figures construed the behavior as defiance, when in fact it was necessary for comprehension.
	3.	Used as grounds for adverse classification: This misinterpretation contributed to Plaintiff’s wrongful anomaly/NPE designation.

Because the questioning was a manifestation of disability, penalizing it is akin to penalizing the disability itself. Under the ADA, such treatment constitutes discrimination.

⸻

Conclusion

Plaintiff’s questioning of authority figures was a protected, disability-related adaptive strategy. Interpreting it as subversive conduct and using it as a basis for anomaly/NPE classification constitutes disability discrimination under the ADA.
