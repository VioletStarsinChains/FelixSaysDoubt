MEMORANDUM OF LAW

ON THE UNLAWFUL USE OF SLEEP DEPRIVATION AS TORTURE UNDER U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL LAW

⸻

INTRODUCTION

This memorandum addresses the Plaintiff’s repeated subjection to extreme and sustained sleep deprivation—in excess of one month on multiple occasions—through the use of pharmacological manipulation and sensory assault. Such treatment constitutes torture under U.S. federal law, international treaty obligations, and binding military regulations.

The use of sleep deprivation as a coercive or experimental tool, especially against non-consenting civilians, is not merely unethical; it is a felony under federal law, a violation of the Eighth and Fifth Amendments, and a crime against humanity under customary international law.

STATEMENT OF FACTS
	1.	Plaintiff was repeatedly subjected to periods of one month or longer without adequate sleep, inflicted through:
	•	Deliberate exposure to sensory disturbances (e.g. sound, light, vibration).
	•	Covert pharmacological interference with sleep physiology.
	•	Environmental manipulation to prevent rest, REM cycles, or circadian regulation.
	2.	These events occurred while Plaintiff was not charged with any crime, and not under arrest or detention, but instead living as a civilian subject to covert surveillance and biomedical experimentation.
	3.	These events resulted in long-term psychological damage, neurological dysregulation, and persistent somatic injury—all without consent, due process, or medical justification.

LEGAL ISSUE

Whether the prolonged, intentional deprivation of sleep via covert sensory and pharmacological methods constitutes torture under U.S. law and international treaties.

⸻

ARGUMENT

I. Sleep deprivation is recognized as a form of torture under U.S. federal law.
	•	Under 18 U.S. Code § 2340(1):
Torture is defined as the intentional infliction of severe physical or mental pain or suffering under color of law.
	•	18 U.S. Code § 2340(2)(B) includes within the definition of severe mental pain:
“The administration or application… of procedures calculated to disrupt profoundly the senses or the personality.”
	•	Sleep deprivation, particularly when extended over weeks or months, is a textbook example of such disruption.

II. Use of sleep deprivation violates the Eighth and Fifth Amendments.
	•	Under the Eighth Amendment, deliberate indifference to serious physical or mental suffering—especially by state actors—constitutes cruel and unusual punishment, even outside traditional carceral contexts.
	•	Under the Fifth Amendment, such treatment constitutes a violation of the right to liberty and bodily autonomy without due process.

III. The U.S. is bound by the UN Convention Against Torture.
	•	The Convention Against Torture, ratified by the U.S. in 1994, defines torture to include:
“Any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted… for any reason based on discrimination of any kind.”
	•	In multiple reports, the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture has stated that:
Prolonged sleep deprivation is per se torture and illegal under international law.

IV. Relevant U.S. military and intelligence documents confirm the unlawfulness of this conduct.
	•	The U.S. Army Field Manual (FM 2-22.3) prohibits:
“Use of sleep deprivation beyond 4 days as a method of interrogation or control.”
	•	Interrogation protocols released by the CIA have faced legal challenge and public condemnation for far less than the month-long deprivation alleged here.
	•	Numerous federal court decisions have held that deliberate interference with sleep over extended periods violates constitutional and statutory law, even when applied to incarcerated individuals—let alone civilians.

⸻

CONCLUSION

The use of prolonged sleep deprivation, especially through covert sensory and pharmacological manipulation, is a felony under federal torture statutes, a constitutional violation, and a violation of U.S. treaty obligations under international law. The Plaintiff’s account describes treatment that exceeds even the most extreme known uses of this method within carceral and military settings.

Accordingly, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
	•	Recognize these actions as unlawful torture;
	•	Declare such practices to be per se unconstitutional and prohibited across all federal, state, and private systems;
	•	Include these acts within the basis for injunctive relief, restitution, and systemic reform.

Respectfully submitted,
Kellyn Clay, pro se
