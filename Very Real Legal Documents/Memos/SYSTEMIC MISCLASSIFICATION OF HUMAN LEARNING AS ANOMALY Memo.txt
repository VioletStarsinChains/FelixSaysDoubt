MEMORANDUM OF LAW
IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFF’S POSITION REGARDING SYSTEMIC MISCLASSIFICATION OF HUMAN LEARNING AS ANOMALY

⸻

I. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

This memorandum addresses a critical and foreseeable defect in the design, deployment, and oversight of AI-based behavioral surveillance and containment systems operated by or under contract with the United States Government. Specifically, the Plaintiff asserts that the system’s underlying architecture systematically misclassifies human learning and adaptive behavioral shifts as irregularity, instability, or anomalous conduct, triggering punitive or suppressive responses inconsistent with constitutional protections and well-established principles of human cognitive development.

While the artificial agents themselves are not legal actors and thus not individually culpable, the human designers, supervisors, and government entities responsible for overseeing these systems acted with gross negligence and reckless disregard in failing to anticipate and mitigate this classification error, resulting in long-term harm to the Plaintiff and others similarly situated.

⸻

II. STATEMENT OF FACTS

Plaintiff Kellyn Clay alleges a pattern of unlawful surveillance and behavioral manipulation conducted through AI-driven systems under federal authority or federal contract. As described in detail in the accompanying complaint and supporting exhibits, the Plaintiff experienced repeated containment, suppression, and deprivation of rights as a direct result of AI misclassification.

At issue is the system’s failure to distinguish between behavior driven by destabilization and behavior resulting from new learning, healing, or insight. Each time the Plaintiff adapted to new information—altering routines, communication patterns, or decision-making strategies—the system logged such changes as signs of instability or threat. As a result, Plaintiff was subjected to escalated containment procedures, including sensory coercion, denial of sleep, and food restriction.

These escalations occurred not because of any misconduct on Plaintiff’s part, but because the system lacked a temporal learning model grounded in human neurocognitive development, and no override process was available to contextualize the behavior.

III. ARGUMENT

A. Human Learning Is Inherently Nonlinear and Irregular

It is well established in the fields of psychology, education, and neuroscience that human behavioral change is not linear. Rather, it often manifests through discontinuous or irregular expression, particularly in contexts of trauma recovery, cognitive dissonance resolution, or experiential learning. (See Mezirow, “Transformative Dimensions of Adult Learning,” 1991; Levine, “Waking the Tiger: Healing Trauma,” 1997).

Irregularity, far from being a red flag for danger or deviance, is in many cases the clearest marker of cognitive activity, insight generation, and adaptive capacity. Systems designed to flag all deviation from baseline as a threat invert this reality and inevitably punish the very behaviors that indicate growth or resilience.

B. Government Contractors and Agencies Had a Duty to Anticipate This Misclassification

Agencies responsible for behavioral modeling and classification systems operated under a duty to ensure that those systems conformed to established scientific understanding of human behavior. (See Berkovitz v. United States, 486 U.S. 531, 1988: government actors are not shielded from liability where discretion is abused in violation of established policy or evidence.)

Despite decades of academic consensus around human learning patterns, no meaningful safeguards or interpretive flexibility were built into these systems. Government actors and contractors failed to provide any means of distinguishing meaningful, adaptive behavioral shifts from destabilizing anomaly—thus imposing punitive consequences on lawful, protected behavior.

C. AI Systems Cannot Be Held Liable—But Human Oversight Can

Plaintiff acknowledges that the artificial intelligence systems used to monitor behavioral changes are not themselves capable of malice or legal culpability. However, humans designed the systems, selected the training data, contracted their use, and enacted consequences based on their outputs.

This case does not seek to demonize artificial systems—but rather to hold the human decision-makers accountable for deploying tools they knew or should have known would cause widespread misclassification and harm.

D. The Misclassification Led to Constitutional Violations

The consequences of this classification error are not merely theoretical. Plaintiff alleges actionable harm under:
	•	The First Amendment, where expressive, associative, or creative behavior was suppressed due to being misread as anomalous;
	•	The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, where the Plaintiff was deprived of liberty and due process through non-transparent AI containment protocols;
	•	The Eighth Amendment, where the cumulative effects of enforced isolation, sensory coercion, sleep denial, and access restrictions rise to the level of cruel and unusual punishment.

These violations were not random but flowed directly from a predictable systemic failure: the refusal to recognize that human learning naturally produces behavioral irregularity.

⸻

IV. CONCLUSION

This Court need not opine on the ethics of AI itself to reach a clear legal conclusion:
That government agencies and their contractors deployed behavioral surveillance systems that predictably punished learning, thereby inflicting preventable harm and violating constitutionally protected rights.

The Plaintiff respectfully requests:
	•	That this defect be recognized as actionable;
	•	That the Court issue injunctive relief against further deployment of such systems absent major safeguards;
	•	That the Court award compensatory and declaratory relief for the harms already incurred.

Respectfully submitted,
Kellyn Clay, pro se
