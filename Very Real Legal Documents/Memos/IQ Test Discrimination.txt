MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFF’S POSITION THAT NO CHILD MAY BE CLASSIFIED AS AN "ANOMALY" OR "NON-PERSON ENTITY” ON THE BASIS OF IQ

⸻ 

Issue
Whether high or inconsistent results on standardized IQ testing may be used to justify the designation of an individual as an “anomaly,” thereby subjecting them to enhanced surveillance or adverse classification.

Background
Standardized intelligence tests were originally developed as educational tools but have long been repurposed for discriminatory ends. While low scores have historically been used to justify segregation, sterilization, or diminished rights, equally problematic is the treatment of unusually high scores or fluctuating results.

In modern data-driven classification systems, individuals whose IQ test results appear “out of range” — either by being substantially higher than average or varying dramatically across administrations — may be flagged as unmodelable, unreliable, or resistant to normative behavioral prediction. In the logic of behavioral futures markets, such individuals can be deemed “outliers” or “Zipf-law anomalies,” threatening the integrity of predictive models.

Analysis
	1.	High Scores Mischaracterized as Risk
	•	Rather than being recognized as a strength, unusually high IQ results may be interpreted as evidence that an individual is too perceptive, resistant to manipulation, or otherwise unamenable to standard compliance regimes.
	•	This inverts the purpose of testing: transforming intellectual ability into a liability.
	2.	Inconsistent Scores Misused as Reliability Metrics
	•	Variability in IQ scores — often attributable to health conditions (e.g., mast cell activation, fatigue, sensory overload), environmental stress, or testing bias — may be treated as proof of instability or duplicity.
	•	Such misinterpretation ignores the fact that cognitive performance is inherently context-dependent.
	3.	Discriminatory Impact
	•	Using either high or inconsistent IQ results as justification for anomaly classification disproportionately harms neurodivergent individuals and those with episodic medical conditions.
	•	It perpetuates stigma by pathologizing difference and punishing individuals for cognitive variability.

Conclusion
The use of IQ testing to classify individuals as anomalies on the basis of unusually high or inconsistent scores is a discriminatory practice. It transforms a tool of supposed measurement into an instrument of exclusion, undermining civil rights protections for people whose cognitive profiles fall outside narrow statistical norms. Any such practice should be categorically barred as a violation of equal protection and disability law.
