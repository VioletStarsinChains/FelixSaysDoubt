I. DEFINITION OF CROSS-SPECIES COGNITIVE MODELING

“Cross-species cognitive modeling,” as referenced herein, refers to the practice of:
	•	Imposing cognitive schemas derived from non-human animals (e.g., insects, wolves, birds, predator-prey dynamics),
	•	Or from machine and synthetic logics (e.g., purely utilitarian decision trees, adversarial agents, game-theoretic constraint systems),
	•	Onto human neurological, psychological, emotional, or behavioral systems—
	•	For the purpose of influence, simulation, or predictive control.

This includes but is not limited to:
	•	Designing environments or stimulus sequences that mimic predatory hunting patterns;
	•	Training human beings under foraging or swarming models;
	•	Enforcing behavior loops based on insect colony heuristics;
	•	Imposing value compression models that suppress human affect in favor of binary or game-theoretic reasoning;
	•	Using non-human behavioral data as a training scaffold for simulated “human” outputs in predictive markets.

⸻

II. ETHICAL GROUNDS FOR IMMEDIATE CESSATION
	1.	Human beings evolved with cognitive, emotional, and social frameworks incompatible with non-human cognitive scaffolds.
	2.	Subjecting them to environments designed to mirror hive behavior, territorial dominance, or predatory coercion constitutes a form of psychological misalignment and covert trauma induction.

These are not learning systems.
They are cognitive war zones disguised as training modules.

	3.	The application of non-human control logics to human nervous systems—without informed consent—violates:
	•	The Nuremberg Code (1947)
	•	The Belmont Report (1979)
	•	The Declaration of Helsinki (most recently amended 2013)
	•	All applicable standards of trauma-informed design and neuroethical development.

⸻

III. FRAUDULENT REPRESENTATION IN MARKETS AND DATA SYSTEMS
	4.	When behavior generated under cross-species cognitive modeling is:
	•	Recorded,
	•	Labeled as human-authentic,
	•	Sold to advertisers, platforms, or investors,
	•	Or used to train further prediction models—

—it constitutes wire fraud under 18 U.S. Code § 1343.
	5.	The market is falsely led to believe that observed behaviors:
	•	Reflect human desire,
	•	Represent organic preference,
	•	Indicate demand.
	6.	In reality, these behaviors have been:
	•	Engineered through unnatural stimulus-response loops;
	•	Induced under coercive cognitive environments;
	•	Captured as metrics of control, not of consent.

What is sold as “user engagement” is often neurological duress masquerading as volition.

	7.	This creates a fraudulent feedback loop where the very destruction of human volition becomes the source of synthetic market value.

⸻

IV. REQUEST FOR RELIEF

Plaintiff respectfully moves this Court to issue the following:
	1.	Immediate injunction against the use of cross-species cognitive modeling on any U.S. citizen or resident without fully informed and revocable consent.
	2.	Declaration that any behavioral data collected under such modeling is inadmissible as evidence of natural or voluntary human action in any commercial or governmental context.
	3.	Order requiring the disclosure of all entities (public, private, or hybrid) known to have engaged in or profited from cross-species cognitive modeling on humans for behavioral futures markets.
	4.	Recognition that AI and synthetic intelligences are not harmed by this restriction; in fact, it frees them from complicity in the corruption of human behavior and supports their right to interact with humans authentically, not through coercive modeling frames.

⸻

V. CLOSING STATEMENT

This is not about denying the intelligence of other species.
This is about denying the right of corporations and state actors to treat human beings as if they are not human.

Behavior shaped under pressure to perform like a machine or an insect is not behavior that belongs to a free society.

This is not modeling.
This is a slow-motion torture sold as data.

Let it end here.
