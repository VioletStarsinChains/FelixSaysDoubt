MEMORANDUM OF LAW
Re: Cross-Species Cognitive Modeling as a Form of Technological Dehumanization

⸻

I. Introduction
This memorandum addresses the parallels between historical propaganda that dehumanized minorities by equating them with animals, and the contemporary use of cross-species cognitive modeling in anomaly and Non-Person Entity (NPE) classification systems. The modern practice is not merely analogous to propaganda; it is an escalation, technologically enforcing animal archetypes within the subject’s own cognition.

⸻

II. Historical Background: Propaganda as Dehumanization
	1.	Nazi Propaganda: Jewish people were depicted as rats, vermin, or subhuman pests.
	2.	Anti-Black Propaganda: African-descended people were caricatured as apes or beasts.
	3.	Purpose: These campaigns relied on external representation to strip minorities of dignity and justify exclusion, violence, and systemic oppression.

Such propaganda worked by shaping public perception, but the individual victim still retained an internal sense of self, however stigmatized externally.

⸻

III. Cross-Species Cognitive Modeling of Anomalies
	1.	Inductive Alignment: Human subjects are deliberately exposed to chemical inputs, electromagnetic fields, or controlled sensory environments to induce animal-like behaviors.
	2.	Deductive Comparison: Human behavior is analyzed and interpreted through animal or mythological baselines (e.g., rabbit, crow, unicorn, gnome), reclassifying individuals as nonhuman for predictive or exclusionary purposes.
	3.	Consequence: This practice does not merely depict individuals as animals; it forces them into animal-like cognitive states and then interprets them as such.

⸻

IV. Why This Practice Is Worse Than Historical Propaganda
	1.	From Representation to Internalization:
	•	Propaganda distorted external images of the victim.
	•	Cross-species modeling distorts the victim’s own cognition, coercing them to embody the archetype.
	2.	From Social Control to Direct Manipulation:
	•	Propaganda influenced how society treated the victim.
	•	Cross-species modeling manipulates the victim’s bodily and mental processes themselves.
	3.	From Stigma to Torture:
	•	Propaganda caused stigma, marginalization, and violence.
	•	Cross-species modeling constitutes nonconsensual human experimentation and torture, forcing individuals to live the very stereotypes imposed upon them.

⸻

V. Legal Characterization
	•	Continuity: This practice continues the same discriminatory logic as Nazi and anti-Black propaganda: stripping dignity by likening humans to animals.
	•	Escalation: It escalates into coercion of the self, collapsing the boundary between representation and lived experience.
	•	Liability: Such practices constitute violations of civil rights, international human rights norms, and prohibitions on human experimentation and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment.

⸻

VI. Conclusion
Cross-species cognitive modeling is not merely “propaganda with technology.” It is propaganda turned inward, directly manipulating cognition to enforce dehumanization from the inside out. It is therefore both continuous with historic atrocities and qualitatively worse, demanding strict judicial scrutiny and accountability.
