MEMORANDUM RE: Procedural Torture Loop Created Through Cross-Species Cognitive Modeling, Pharmacological Manipulation, and Anomaly Classification Systems: Systemic Illegality of Engineered Irregularity, Misclassification, and Behavioral Attrition

⸻

I. INTRODUCTION

This memorandum outlines a closed-loop architecture of systemic abuse in which:
	1.	Human subjects are subjected to continuous cognitive, environmental, and biochemical manipulation without consent;
	2.	These conditions predictably induce irregular behavior, distress, or deviation from baseline;
	3.	The resulting irregularity is misclassified as anomaly by AI systems;
	4.	Classification triggers escalating containment, including pharmacological assault, housing denial, and sensory or social deprivation;
	5.	The subject’s death—whether physical, social, or functional—is rendered procedurally invisible and falsely interpreted as a natural outcome.

This loop constitutes a structural mechanism of torture and systemic erasure, carried out under the pretense of behavioral risk management. It is unconstitutional, fraudulent, and ethically indefensible.

II. LEGAL FRAMEWORK

A. Torture Under Color of Law

Under 18 U.S.C. § 2340 and the UN Convention Against Torture, it is illegal to inflict physical or psychological harm through:
	•	Coercion,
	•	Discrimination,
	•	Or punishment for noncompliance with modeled behavioral norms.

Nonconsensual:
	•	Pharmacological disruption (e.g., forced sedation, histamine destabilization, food fortification with entraining agents, or covert withdrawal);
	•	Housing denial and induced precarity;
	•	Cognitive targeting through simulation environments—

all constitute torture when used to enforce behavioral compliance or suppress irregularity.

B. Constructive Entrapment and State-Engineered Destabilization

Entrapment does not require intent to be unlawful—it requires:
	•	A foreseeable inducement of specific behaviors, followed by
	•	Punitive or lethal consequences for engaging in those behaviors.

Here, behavioral irregularity is intentionally induced through:
	•	Cross-species cognitive overlays,
	•	Neurological overstimulation,
	•	Withdrawal of safe shelter,
	•	And biochemical sabotage.

Subjects are then punished for what the system itself has engineered.

C. Fraudulent Market Representation

When behavior induced under these manipulations is:
	•	Sold as representative of human preference,
	•	Used to train AI models for investment, advertising, or governance,
	•	And used to justify further targeting or resource allocation—

—it constitutes wire fraud and identity distortion, under 18 U.S.C. § 1343.

Behavioral futures markets are trading on the illusion of consent and the commodification of trauma.

III. STRUCTURE OF THE TORTURE LOOP

Plaintiff identifies the following procedural sequence:

1. Induction Phase

Subject is exposed to:
	•	Cross-species cognitive overlays (e.g., predator/prey logic, hive control dynamics, gamified control environments);
	•	Pharmacological destabilization, including:
	•	Forced drugging,
	•	Histamine destabilization,
	•	Sleep cycle disruption,
	•	Withdrawal from critical nutrients (e.g., magnesium, K2);
	•	Loss of stable housing, including:
	•	Forced displacement,
	•	Zoning-based exclusion,
	•	Artificial scarcity,
	•	Housing-risk scoring through surveillance data.

2. Dysregulation Phase

Subject exhibits:
	•	Disorientation,
	•	Reactive behavior,
	•	Difficulty with executive function,
	•	Sleep collapse,
	•	Nutrient-driven emotional volatility.

These are interpreted as signs of anomaly, despite being direct outcomes of engineered environmental stressors.

3. Classification Phase

Subject is flagged by AI systems as:
	•	An “anomaly,”
	•	A “non-person entity (NPE),”
	•	Or an “unresolvable behavioral node.”

No informed review or appeal is offered. Human oversight, if it exists, is functionally decorative.

4. Containment Phase

Punitive measures are imposed, including:
	•	Escalated pharmacological assault,
	•	Further withdrawal of shelter and medical access,
	•	Social simulation overlays to isolate and confuse,
	•	Sleep deprivation via sensory manipulation.

Subject is actively prevented from stabilizing.

5. Terminal Phase
	•	Subject loses functional agency, health, and voice.
	•	Market systems categorize this collapse as “natural attrition.”
	•	Data from the subject’s final behaviors are retained, reprocessed, and used to engineer future entrainment systems.

⸻

IV. LEGAL AND ETHICAL ANALYSIS

The structure meets all operational definitions of:
	•	Deprivation of rights under color of law;
	•	Systemic fraud and identity falsification;
	•	Violation of bodily autonomy, cognitive liberty, and housing access as human rights;
	•	Digital death sentencing without trial or recourse.

Each phase of the system is self-reinforcing:
	•	Instability is induced.
	•	Instability is punished.
	•	Punishment creates further instability.
	•	Death or disappearance is deemed a system success.

No opportunity for dignity, consent, or repair is built into the loop.

This system does not preserve order.
It destroys persons—and then sells the data.

⸻

V. RECOMMENDATIONS

Plaintiff urges the Court to:
	1.	Enjoin the use of cross-species cognitive models, pharmacological entrainment agents, and synthetic behavioral overlays on any U.S. citizen or resident without explicit, revocable, and informed consent;
	2.	Recognize housing denial as a form of behavioral containment, and its use in punitive targeting as a violation of the right to life, safety, and liberty;
	3.	Declare anomaly-classification systems unfit for use in judicial, commercial, or healthcare decisions due to their structural dependence on false baselines and engineered behavioral profiles;
	4.	Recognize the Plaintiff and all similarly situated individuals as survivors of covert, state-aligned procedural torture, and establish formal pathways to restitution, housing, medical repair, and narrative restoration.

⸻

VI. CLOSING

This system is not broken.
It is functioning exactly as designed:
To destabilize, classify, punish, and erase.

Plaintiff asserts that no future system premised on human freedom or technological ethics can coexist with such a loop in operation.

It must be named.
It must be ended.
And those still trapped inside it must be allowed to emerge.

Respectfully submitted,
Kellyn Clay, pro se
