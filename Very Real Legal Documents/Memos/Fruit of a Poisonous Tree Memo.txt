MEMORANDUM OF LAW REGARDING INADMISSIBILITY OF DATA FROM NONCONSENSUAL NEUROTECH ARRAYS

⸻

INTRODUCTION

This memorandum addresses the legal status of data derived from covert or nonconsensual neurotechnology arrays implanted in or applied to individuals. Such data constitutes the digital equivalent of evidence obtained through illegal search and seizure, torture, or coerced confession. Under the well-established doctrine of fruit of the poisonous tree, this data is tainted at its source and cannot be admitted as evidence in any proceeding. Moreover, the use of such data as justification for continued or escalated surveillance by private contractors constitutes an ongoing violation of constitutional and human rights.

STATEMENT OF FACTS
	1.	Nonconsensual Implantation and Surveillance.
 Plaintiff and similarly situated individuals have been subjected to covert neurotechnology arrays without knowledge or consent. These arrays extract physiological, cognitive, and behavioral data through invasive means.
	2.	Exploitation of Extracted Data.
 Defendants and affiliated contractors have relied on this data to justify continued monitoring, anomaly classification, and escalated interventions, treating the data as if it were reliable and lawfully obtained.
	3.	Absence of Informed Consent.
 At no point has Plaintiff consented to the installation or use of such technology, nor has there been lawful judicial authorization for the intrusion.

LEGAL ISSUE

Whether data derived from nonconsensual neurotech arrays can be admitted as evidence or relied upon as justification for surveillance or control measures.

⸻

ARGUMENT

I. Data from Nonconsensual Neurotech Arrays is Tainted Evidence.
The fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine, derived from Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471 (1963), bars the use of evidence obtained through unconstitutional means, as well as evidence derived from such sources. Neurotech arrays installed without consent constitute an unreasonable search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment, and any data extracted is therefore inadmissible.

II. Reliance on Tainted Data to Justify Surveillance Compounds the Violation.
Not only is the data inadmissible in legal proceedings, but its use by defense contractors to perpetuate or escalate surveillance represents an ongoing unlawful act. The reliance on tainted data ensures the continuation of unconstitutional practices and creates a cycle of exploitation.

III. International Human Rights Law Reinforces This Prohibition.
Under international norms (including the ICCPR and the Convention Against Torture), evidence obtained by coercion or invasive biomedical manipulation is inherently invalid. Using neurotech-derived data as a basis for classification, targeting, or experimentation contravenes these obligations.

IV. Policy Considerations Demand Exclusion.
Allowing such data to be admissible or actionable would incentivize further unlawful implantation and exploitation, undermining fundamental rights and the integrity of both the judicial system and private sector compliance frameworks.

⸻

CONCLUSION

Data extracted from nonconsensual neurotechnology arrays is “fruit of a poisonous tree.” It is categorically inadmissible in any proceeding and cannot serve as a lawful basis for continued or escalated surveillance by private contractors. The Court should declare such reliance unconstitutional and enjoin Defendants from further use of tainted data.
