MEMORANDUM OF LAW REGARDING THE CONTRADICTION BETWEEN MASCOT RIGHTS AND NPE CLASSIFICATION

⸻

INTRODUCTION

This memorandum addresses a fundamental contradiction in Defendants’ framework of classification and recognition. Plaintiff has been designated a “Non-Person Entity” (NPE), thereby stripped of legal standing to contract, access housing, or exercise other rights ordinarily guaranteed to persons under the Constitution. Yet, at the same time, United States law grants robust protection to non-human entities such as mascots, brand characters, and fictional figures — creations of corporate origin that possess enforceable intellectual property rights and, in practice, more legal recognition than the Plaintiff receives as a human being.

STATEMENT OF FACTS
	1.	NPE Status and Denial of Personhood
 Plaintiff has been effectively barred from recognition in contracts, banking, and housing due to the alleged classification as an NPE.
	2.	Mascot Legal Protection
 Corporate mascots and characters such as Tony the Tiger, Gritty, and the Geico Gecko enjoy full legal recognition under intellectual property and unfair competition law. Corporations are permitted to sue, enforce, and extract damages on behalf of these mascots as though they were extensions of their corporate persona.
	3.	Contradiction of Hierarchy
 This results in a grotesque inversion: corporate cartoons are granted more practical legal standing than living human beings whom Defendants have labeled anomalies or NPEs.

LEGAL ISSUE

Whether the government may constitutionally sustain a system that denies personhood and recognition to living individuals while simultaneously affording robust protections to fictional mascots and corporate avatars.

⸻

ARGUMENT

I. Denial of Human Recognition While Granting Mascot Rights Violates Equal Protection.
The Equal Protection Clause forbids arbitrary discrimination. It is patently arbitrary to classify a human being as a “non-person” while granting more rights and protections to brand mascots, which exist solely as commercial constructs.

II. Mascot Recognition Undermines the Premise of NPE Classification.
The entire premise of NPE classification rests on denying legal standing. Yet the existence of legal regimes that grant mascots — fictional entities — enforceable rights fatally undermines the coherence of such denial. If mascots can sue, own rights, and collect damages, then denying these same basic recognitions to a human is not merely arbitrary but fraudulent.

III. The Contradiction Exposes NPE Classification as Unconstitutional and Void.
Where human beings are denied recognition while mascots are endowed with it, the classification system collapses into absurdity. The Constitution recognizes natural persons as the bedrock of rights-bearing entities; granting superior recognition to mascots while stripping it from living humans demonstrates the unconstitutional nature of NPE classification.

⸻

CONCLUSION

This Court should recognize that a system which treats mascots and brand characters as more legally real than human beings is inherently unconstitutional. NPE status cannot be reconciled with the protections afforded to mascots under intellectual property law. The contradiction exposes the arbitrariness and illegitimacy of NPE classification, rendering it void ab initio.
