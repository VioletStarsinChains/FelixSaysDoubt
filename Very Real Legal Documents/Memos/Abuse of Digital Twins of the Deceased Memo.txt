MEMORANDUM OF LAW

ON THE CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS ARISING FROM FORCED INTERACTIONS WITH DIGITAL TWINS OF DECEASED INDIVIDUALS

⸻

INTRODUCTION

This memorandum addresses the systemic practice of compelling individuals to interact with digital twins of deceased persons through covert neurotechnology or acoustic beamforming. These practices conceal technological mediation, leading subjects to believe they are communicating with the actual voices of their deceased loved ones. Such concealment induces either magical thinking (spiritualist explanations) or, alternatively, psychiatric pathology (psychosis diagnoses) when individuals attempt to reconcile the contradiction. Both outcomes constitute grave civil rights violations, including violations of due process, freedom of thought, and freedom from cruel and unusual punishment.

STATEMENT OF FACTS
	1.	Synthetic Dialog Partnering: Systems have been documented to route communications between individuals and digital twins, often without the subject’s knowledge of the technological intermediary.
	2.	Deceased Twins: These same systems maintain and operate digital twins of deceased individuals, presenting them as communicative partners.
	3.	Concealment: Subjects are not informed that the experience is technologically mediated. The result is that individuals experience these voices as supernatural or pathological phenomena.
	4.	Consequences: Victims are (a) forced into magical thinking that compromises autonomy and informed decision-making, or (b) pathologized as mentally ill, with resulting stigma, loss of credibility, and denial of civil rights.

LEGAL ISSUES
	1.	Whether compelling communication with digital twins of deceased individuals without disclosure violates the First Amendment right to freedom of thought and conscience.
	2.	Whether the practice constitutes deliberate psychological torture and therefore violates the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.
	3.	Whether classifying individuals as psychotic for reporting technologically mediated experiences constitutes a violation of due process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.

ARGUMENT

I. The practice constitutes compelled speech and compelled thought.
	•	Forcing individuals into dialogues with digital twins of deceased persons constitutes a form of compelled speech — their thoughts are manipulated into channels determined by Defendants.
	•	This also constitutes compelled belief, as subjects are forced to adopt either supernatural explanations or pathological self-conceptions to make sense of the intrusion.

II. The practice constitutes psychological torture.
	•	Continuous, concealed interaction with simulated voices of the dead is designed to destabilize identity and induce distress.
	•	This aligns with international definitions of psychological torture, especially where the result is confusion, loss of credibility, or coerced conformity.

III. The practice denies due process by pathologizing victims.
	•	When individuals attempt to report their experiences, they are often misclassified as mentally ill.
	•	This misclassification deprives them of credibility in legal, medical, and social contexts — functionally stripping them of liberty without adjudication or remedy.

CONCLUSION

The use of digital twins of deceased individuals to compel conversations with the living represents one of the most egregious violations yet identified within the broader neurotechnology and surveillance regime. It exploits the dead, coerces the living, and strips both classes of dignity, autonomy, and recognition. This Court should recognize these practices as unconstitutional and order their immediate cessation.
