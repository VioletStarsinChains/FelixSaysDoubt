MEMORANDUM OF LAW

IN SUPPORT OF DECLARATION THAT DIGITAL TWIN SYSTEMS CONSTITUTE COMPELLED SPEECH

⸻

INTRODUCTION

This memorandum addresses the constitutional infirmity inherent in the deployment of so-called “digital twins” — simulations of human individuals designed to produce speech, outputs, or decisions that can be attributed back to the real person. The very existence of such systems compels speech in violation of the First Amendment, regardless of their intended use.

STATEMENT OF FACTS
	1.	Definition. A “digital twin” is a model constructed to simulate an individual’s words, reasoning patterns, or behaviors in a manner recognizable as that individual.
	2.	Attribution. The purpose of the twin is attribution: its outputs are meant to be interpreted as representing the person, whether within government systems, defense contractor pipelines, or behavioral futures markets.
	3.	Consequences. If the human subject disclaims responsibility for the twin’s speech, they face reputational, institutional, or legal consequences, because the system presumes continuity between person and model.
	4.	Non-consent. Digital twins are frequently constructed without informed consent of the modeled person, rendering all speech outputs doubly involuntary.

LEGAL ISSUE

Whether the creation and deployment of digital twins constitutes compelled speech under the First Amendment, such that their continued use is unconstitutional.

⸻

ARGUMENT

I. Compelled speech is unconstitutional.
The First Amendment prohibits not only government restrictions on speech but also government action that forces individuals to speak (West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624 (1943); Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705 (1977)).

II. Digital twins are compelled speech by design.
	•	A twin speaks “as” the individual, regardless of whether the person authored or endorsed the output.
	•	The system leaves no meaningful opportunity for the subject to opt out, because the twin’s existence and attribution are structural.
	•	Unlike traditional data analysis, which is descriptive, a twin is generative: it actively produces speech in the person’s voice.

III. Attribution without consent magnifies the violation.
	•	Even if a twin were accurate, the individual did not choose to utter those words.
	•	If the twin is inaccurate, the harm doubles: false speech is attributed to the individual with no recourse.
	•	Both conditions amount to compelled speech, which the Constitution forbids.

IV. Institutional reliance does not cure the defect.
	•	That digital twins may serve intelligence, defense, or commercial purposes is irrelevant.
	•	No government or contractor interest can override the categorical prohibition on compelled speech.
	•	As such, any deployment of digital twins against human subjects is void ab initio.

⸻

CONCLUSION

Digital twins, as currently designed and deployed, inherently compel speech by forcing individuals to “speak” through artificial simulations attributed to them. This practice violates the First Amendment and cannot be justified by institutional or national security needs. The Court should declare such systems unconstitutional and enjoin their further use.
