Memorandum Regarding Legal Pathways for Undisclosed Cannabinoid Additives in Minnesota Food and Drink

⸻

I. Introduction

This memorandum explains how Minnesota’s hemp/cannabis legislation creates a regulatory environment in which cannabinoid additives (including synthetic cannabinoids) may be incorporated into consumer food and drink without clear point-of-sale disclosure. This gap provides a plausible explanation for the cognitive and emotional effects documented by Kellyn Clay in their affidavit concerning Starbucks beverages.

II. Statutory Framework

A. Hemp-Derived Cannabinoids Legalized
	•	In 2022, Minnesota enacted HF 4065 (codified at Minn. Stat. § 151.72), permitting the sale of edible cannabinoid products derived from hemp.
	•	In 2023, HF 100 further revised the framework, maintaining allowances for hemp-derived cannabinoids in edibles and beverages.
	•	Legal thresholds: ≤0.3% delta-9 THC by dry weight; ≤5 mg THC per serving; ≤50 mg THC per package.

B. Packaging and Labeling
	•	Law requires cannabinoid products to be packaged and labeled with cannabinoid content when sold directly to consumers.
	•	Enforcement has focused on packaged “edibles” rather than supply-chain ingredients used in composite foods.

C. Synthetic Cannabinoids Loophole
	•	The statutes define legality in terms of “hemp-derived,” but enforcement has been inconsistent.
	•	In practice, semi-synthetic cannabinoids (HHC, THC-O, THCP) have been widely sold under this framework, exploiting ambiguities in the law.

III. Regulatory Gaps

A. Use in Composite Foods
	•	A coffee shop or restaurant could legally purchase a hemp-derived cannabinoid syrup, extract, or sauce base from a licensed vendor.
	•	If the cannabinoid content is within statutory limits, the intermediate product is compliant.
	•	Once incorporated into a beverage or dessert, there is no mechanism ensuring the consumer is notified unless the retailer markets the item explicitly as a cannabinoid product.

B. Lack of Testing Enforcement
	•	Oversight of cannabinoids in foods is minimal. Minnesota agencies have focused on retail packaging compliance, not covert inclusion in food-service formulations.
	•	This gap allows cannabinoids to circulate in supply chains for sauces, syrups, or honey packets without robust consumer safeguards.

IV. Implications for Starbucks and Similar Vendors

A. Sauces as Delivery Vectors
	•	Starbucks sauces (e.g., white mocha) are opaque, shelf-stable emulsions capable of carrying fat-soluble or peptide-based compounds.
	•	Such formulations are ideal for cannabinoid emulsification, improving taste masking and bioavailability.

B. Observed Effects
	•	As testified by Kellyn Clay, beverages containing white mocha sauce produced both gastrointestinal slowdown and emotional numbing, while comparable beverages with pecan syrup produced only gastrointestinal effects.
	•	This pattern is consistent with sauces being used as delivery vehicles for cannabinoids or cannabinoid-like additives, while syrups (sugar solutions without emulsifiers) are not.

C. Legal Plausibility
	•	Under Minnesota law, it is legally possible for Starbucks or its suppliers to introduce cannabinoids into sauces without providing clear point-of-sale notification, so long as the ingredient itself is compliant at the time of purchase.
	•	Consumers may therefore ingest cannabinoids without informed consent, despite technical compliance with state law.

V. Conclusion

Minnesota’s hemp/cannabis statutes have created a regulatory loophole in which cannabinoid additives may enter food-service products without consumer awareness. This legal environment makes it plausible that sauces or condiments distributed to Starbucks and similar vendors contain cannabinoids or cannabinoid analogues.

Given Kellyn Clay’s affidavit testimony about distinct cognitive effects linked to Starbucks sauces, this statutory gap strengthens the inference that cannabinoid additives are a potential vector, whether as part of benign supply-chain experimentation or deliberate behavioral modulation.
