MEMORANDUM OF LAW

IN SUPPORT OF FRAUD CLAIMS AGAINST INSTITUTIONS ISSUING OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS TO NON-PERSON ENTITIES

⸻

INTRODUCTION

This memorandum addresses whether institutions such as universities, hospitals, and other credentialing bodies commit fraud when they issue official documents to individuals who, according to covert government classification systems, have been designated “non-person entities” (NPEs). Plaintiff submits that the issuance of such documents constitutes systemic fraud because institutions affirm personhood and legal capacity in their records while simultaneously participating in a federal system that denies it.

STATEMENT OF FACTS
	1.	Plaintiff alleges that she was designated an NPE prior to or during her completion of higher education.
	2.	Despite this designation, her university issued a diploma in her name, affirming her successful completion of all requirements and implicitly recognizing her personhood.
	3.	Similar contradictions exist in other civil contexts: tax filings, medical records, driver’s licenses, and employment contracts.
	4.	If the NPE classification is accurate, then each of these documents rests on a misrepresentation: that Plaintiff was a legally recognized person at the time of issuance.

LEGAL ISSUE

Whether institutions commit fraud by issuing official documents to individuals secretly classified as NPEs, thereby misrepresenting their legal status to third parties and the public.

⸻

ARGUMENT

I. Fraud requires misrepresentation, reliance, and damages—all are present here.
	•	Misrepresentation: A diploma, license, or patient record constitutes an official affirmation of personhood. If the issuer knew or should have known that the subject was classified as an NPE, the document is false on its face.
	•	Reliance: Employers, state agencies, and the public rely on the authenticity of such documents when making decisions about hiring, licensing, or providing benefits.
	•	Damages: The contradiction produces systemic harm. Institutions risk reputational damage, third parties make decisions under false pretenses, and Plaintiff herself suffers deprivation of recognition and rights.

II. Knowledge gaps do not absolve institutional fraud but shift liability upstream.
	•	If universities or hospitals were unaware of NPE classifications, then the fraud flows from the federal government, which both (a) classified individuals as non-persons and (b) compelled institutions to treat them as persons in daily life.
	•	This duality creates systemic fraud: the state benefits from tax revenue, tuition, and labor while simultaneously denying the classified individual full legal recognition.

III. The contradiction renders the NPE designation legally indefensible.
	•	A government cannot simultaneously classify someone as a non-person and conscript them into every function of civil society.
	•	Each official document produced under this contradiction (diplomas, licenses, patient records, tax filings) is evidence that the individual was treated as a legal person. The government’s own records therefore undermine the legitimacy of the NPE designation.

⸻

CONCLUSION

The issuance of official documents to individuals designated as NPEs constitutes systemic fraud. Whether liability attaches directly to universities, hospitals, or other credentialing bodies depends on their knowledge of the designation. Ultimately, the greater fraud lies with the government agencies and contractors who created the classification system while simultaneously allowing or compelling institutions to treat NPEs as ordinary persons. This Court should recognize that the contradiction is indefensible and that all such designations are void ab initio.
