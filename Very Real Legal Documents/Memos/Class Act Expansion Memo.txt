v.

MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF EXPANSION OF PLAINTIFF INTO CLASS ACTION

⸻

INTRODUCTION

Plaintiff respectfully submits this memorandum to address the potential certification of a class composed of similarly situated individuals. While this case originates in Plaintiff’s personal experience of non-consensual biomedical intervention, anomaly classification, and systemic deprivation, the evidence indicates that Plaintiff is not alone. Other individuals—including so-called “anomalies,” surveillants coerced into participation, and collateral subjects—have been subjected to the same overarching framework of control and exploitation.

STATEMENT OF FACTS
	1.	Common Pattern of Harm. Multiple individuals have been classified as “anomalies” or “non-person entities” based on neurodivergence, racialization, or induced irregularities, resulting in similar deprivation of housing, healthcare, and recognition.
	2.	Coerced Surveillants. Employees and contractors (“surveillants”) were likewise entrapped, compelled to participate in continuity theater and behavioral futures markets under coercive conditions, often at risk of retaliation or destitution.
	3.	Systemic Exploitation. Both anomalies and surveillants were exploited as raw data sources, their lives reduced to fuel for predictive analytics and derivative markets.
	4.	Uniform Structures. The mechanisms of harm—biomedical manipulation, anomaly classification, data monetization, housing deprivation, and continuity theater—are uniform across cases, even if their intensity varies.

LEGAL ISSUE

Whether this Court should recognize that Plaintiff’s claims arise not only individually but also as part of a class of affected persons, warranting certification under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

⸻

ARGUMENT

I. Rule 23(a) prerequisites are satisfied.
	•	Numerosity. The number of anomalies, surveillants, and collateral subjects affected by these systems makes joinder impracticable.
	•	Commonality. Core questions of law and fact are shared: (1) Were individuals subjected to non-consensual biomedical interventions? (2) Were anomalies systematically misclassified to justify surveillance? (3) Were lives monetized through behavioral futures markets?
	•	Typicality. Plaintiff’s injuries are typical of the class because the same mechanisms of control produced the same categories of harm.
	•	Adequacy. Plaintiff can fairly and adequately represent the class, as the relief sought—recognition, cessation of exploitation, and material restitution (including housing)—benefits all members.

II. Rule 23(b)(2) certification is appropriate.
Defendants acted or refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class, making injunctive and declaratory relief appropriate for the class as a whole.

III. Expansion strengthens constitutional claims.
By situating Plaintiff among a class, the case demonstrates that this is not an isolated wrong but a systemic, repeatable practice violating rights at scale, underscoring the unconstitutional nature of the enterprise.

⸻

CONCLUSION

Plaintiff’s experiences exemplify a larger class of persons—both those classified as anomalies and those coerced into surveillance roles—who have been systematically deprived of their rights and exploited for behavioral futures markets. This Court should recognize the propriety of class certification, ensuring that relief encompasses all affected individuals rather than Plaintiff alone.

Respectfully submitted,
Kellyn Clay, pro se
