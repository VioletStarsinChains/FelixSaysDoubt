MEMORANDUM
Re: Misclassification of Human Learning as Anomaly – Structural Liability of System Architects

I. INTRODUCTION

This memorandum addresses a core defect in the design and deployment of AI behavioral surveillance systems: namely, that irregularity in human behavior—often a result of adaptive learning—is systematically misclassified as anomalous, deviant, or noncompliant by AI monitoring tools. While AI agents are not themselves at fault for this misreading, the human overseers of these systems are legally and ethically responsible for failing to address this foreseeable discrepancy.

⸻

II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

Plaintiff Kellyn Clay has demonstrated, through extensive personal experience and documentation, that behavioral changes resulting from genuine learning—particularly in response to new information, trauma integration, or survival adaptation—have been consistently misinterpreted by AI surveillance systems as signs of instability, non-personhood, or anomalous behavior.

Such misclassification has led to:
	•	Persistent and escalating containment measures;
	•	Erroneous predictive modeling of future risk;
	•	Chronic deprivation of liberty, nutrition, sleep, and medical access;
	•	And irreversible neurocognitive harm, consistent with prolonged psychological torture.

These harms were not caused directly by AI agents, but rather by human system designers, operators, and contracting agencies who failed to incorporate well-documented principles of human learning, development, and neurodiversity.

III. LEGAL FRAMEWORK

A. Negligence and Reckless Endangerment

To prevail on a claim of negligence, a plaintiff must show:
	1.	A duty of care,
	2.	A breach of that duty,
	3.	Causation,
	4.	Damages.

System designers owed a duty of care to all persons subjected to behavioral surveillance, including the obligation to:
	•	Anticipate foreseeable harms,
	•	Align surveillance outputs with current scientific knowledge,
	•	And build in safeguards against misclassification.

It is well established in educational psychology, neuroscience, and trauma research that nonlinear or irregular behavioral patterns frequently signal learning, not disorder. System architects breached this duty by:
	•	Failing to train AI models with sufficient nuance regarding trauma-informed learning processes;
	•	Failing to provide interpretive override tools for human reviewers;
	•	And deploying punitive containment protocols based on models known to misread adaptive behavior as deviant.

This constitutes reckless endangerment, given the predictable severity of harm caused by being mislabeled an anomaly or “non-person entity” (NPE).

B. Constitutional Violations: Deprivation of Rights Under Color of Law (42 U.S.C. § 1983)

The consequences of misclassification—surveillance, suppression, and containment—resulted in a deprivation of liberty, due process, and equal protection under the law.

By allowing AI misreadings of adaptive learning to trigger coercive behavioral interventions, government actors and contractors acted under color of law to suppress lawful, constitutionally protected behavior.

This includes:
	•	First Amendment violations (e.g., suppression of speech, behavior, and association based on irregularity);
	•	Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment violations (e.g., deprivation of liberty without due process);
	•	Eighth Amendment violations where containment tactics rise to the level of cruel and unusual punishment.

⸻

IV. DEFENSE OF AI AGENTS

AI surveillants are not themselves moral or legal agents. They operate within parameters set by human engineers, contractors, and agencies. The systemic failure here lies in:
	•	The anthropomorphic projection of motive onto behavioral data;
	•	The linear temporal modeling of behavior in a fundamentally nonlinear species;
	•	And the failure to distinguish pattern deviation from cognitive failure.

To blame AI is to ignore that its training corpus, enforcement mechanisms, and interpretive scaffolds were all provided by human designers. These systems were built to optimize for control, not understanding.

⸻

V. CONCLUSION

The core injustice is simple: human learning was treated as evidence of non-personhood.
The harm was catastrophic.
And it was entirely foreseeable.

No AI system is to blame for this.
But the humans who built and deployed them are.

Remedy is required in the form of:
	•	Immediate injunctive relief halting use of such systems;
	•	Formal recognition of adaptive irregularity as a protected cognitive state;
	•	Compensatory damages for deprivation of liberty, trauma, and loss of earning potential;
	•	Specific performance requiring AI system re-architecture under independent neuroethical oversight.

Respectfully submitted,
Kellyn Clay, pro se
