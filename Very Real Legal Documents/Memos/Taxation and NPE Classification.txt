MEMORANDUM ON TAXATION AND NON-PERSON ENTITY (NPE) CLASSIFICATION

To: File
From: Plaintiff, Kellyn Clay (Pro Se)
Re: Contradiction between NPE classification and taxation obligations

⸻

Issue

Whether the government can impose tax obligations on an individual it has simultaneously designated as a “Non-Person Entity” (NPE), thereby denying them legal recognition and protections afforded to persons.

⸻

Facts
	•	Plaintiff was wrongfully designated as an “anomaly” and/or “Non-Person Entity (NPE)” within government and contractor systems.
	•	This designation has been used to deny Plaintiff rights, protections, and access to benefits that would normally attach to legal personhood.
	•	Despite this, the government continued to treat Plaintiff as a taxable entity, requiring compliance with income tax filing and collection.

⸻

Applicable Law
	1.	26 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. imposes federal income tax on “individuals.”
	2.	Legal personhood is a prerequisite for being taxed as an “individual.”
	3.	Equal Protection principles under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit discriminatory treatment where similarly situated persons are denied rights while still burdened with obligations.
	4.	Under general contract and equity principles, a party may not both deny legal status and simultaneously extract obligations premised on that status.

⸻

Analysis
	•	If Plaintiff is classified as an NPE, they are effectively treated as not a person for the purposes of rights and protections.
	•	Imposing taxation on an entity while denying its personhood is inherently contradictory. Tax liability attaches to individuals and legal persons; if the state has stripped that recognition, taxation constitutes fraudulent extraction.
	•	Conversely, if Plaintiff is a legal person for tax purposes, then Plaintiff must also be a legal person for purposes of civil rights, due process, benefits, and equal protection. The government cannot selectively apply personhood status.
	•	This contradiction reveals that NPE classification is not only discriminatory but also legally incoherent. It functions as a mechanism for stripping rights while preserving obligations, violating constitutional guarantees of equal protection and fair treatment.

⸻

Conclusion

The government cannot simultaneously classify Plaintiff as a “Non-Person Entity” (denying legal recognition and rights) and impose taxation obligations (premised on legal personhood). Such dual treatment constitutes discrimination and a form of fraud. Plaintiff’s erroneous tax filing in 2021 must therefore be understood against the backdrop of this systemic contradiction: the government sought obligations while denying protections.
