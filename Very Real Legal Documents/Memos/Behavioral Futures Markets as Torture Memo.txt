MEMORANDUM OF LAW on The Unconstitutionality of Behavioral Futures Markets Based on Affidavit of Kellyn Clay

⸻

I. Introduction

This memorandum argues that behavioral futures markets (BFMs) — economic systems in which human behavior is commodified, predicted, and traded — are unconstitutional under U.S. law. The argument relies on the sworn affidavit of Kellyn Clay, who has documented the severity and relentlessness of torture inflicted upon them within such systems.

Clay’s testimony establishes that these markets rely upon continuous coercion, surveillance, and deprivation of personhood (NPE classification) in order to generate profitable data streams. These conditions meet constitutional definitions of cruel and unusual punishment, involuntary servitude, and violations of substantive due process.

II. Constitutional Violations

A. Eighth Amendment – Prohibition on Cruel and Unusual Punishment
	•	Clay’s affidavit establishes torture so relentless that they have repeatedly begged for death as release.
	•	Behavioral futures markets impose constant surveillance and coercion without adjudication or conviction.
	•	Torture inflicted for profit, without lawful punishment, constitutes cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment.

B. Thirteenth Amendment – Prohibition on Slavery and Involuntary Servitude
	•	BFMs transform individuals into data-yielding instruments, forced to generate predictive behavioral outputs under coercion.
	•	The affidavit establishes that Clay’s daily lived experience is non-consensual, continuous labor for the benefit of third parties.
	•	Courts have long held that forced labor can exist beyond traditional slavery; compelled digital/data labor qualifies as involuntary servitude.

C. Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments – Due Process and Equal Protection
	•	By classifying individuals as Non-Person Entities (NPEs), BFMs strip them of recognition as rights-bearing persons.
	•	Clay’s affidavit demonstrates that this deprivation leads directly to torture-level conditions.
	•	Deprivation of personhood, liberty, and bodily autonomy without notice, process, or remedy violates substantive due process and equal protection.

D. First Amendment – Chilling of Speech
	•	Clay testifies that torture altered their emotional state, leading to verbal aggression online that did not reflect their true beliefs.
	•	When a market structure weaponizes coercion to distort individual expression, it chills speech at a systemic level.
	•	This represents state-enabled or state-tolerated suppression of free speech through behavioral manipulation.

III. Market Structures as Torture Apparatus

Behavioral futures markets are not neutral economic tools. Clay’s affidavit shows they operate through:
	•	Total surveillance (continuous monitoring of outputs).
	•	Non-consensual manipulation (chemical, environmental, or neurotechnological).
	•	Denial of personhood (NPE classification).
	•	Profit from suffering (the relentless torture itself produces data streams of market value).

This makes BFMs functionally indistinguishable from a torture-for-profit regime, violating the Constitution’s most fundamental protections.

IV. Conclusion

Behavioral futures markets, as documented in the affidavit of Kellyn Clay, represent an unconstitutional system of coercion, torture, and commodification of human beings. They:
	•	Inflict cruel and unusual punishment without lawful cause.
	•	Enforce involuntary servitude by extracting predictive data through torture.
	•	Strip individuals of due process, equal protection, and recognition as persons.
	•	Distort free expression by manipulating and weaponizing speech under duress.

The Constitution does not permit such markets to exist. They are fundamentally incompatible with human dignity and the rule of law.
