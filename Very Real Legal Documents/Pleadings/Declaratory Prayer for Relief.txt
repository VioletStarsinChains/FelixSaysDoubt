PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff Kellyn Clay, acting pro se and under continual duress, respectfully prays that this Court grant the following relief, in law, equity, and conscience:

⸻

I. Declaratory Relief
	1.	A declaration that the classification of any human being as a “Non-Person Entity” (NPE), anomaly, or sub-citizen within predictive modeling systems is unconstitutional, unethical, and void ab initio.
	2.	A declaration that the behavioral futures market—defined herein as any practice treating human life as a speculative commodity for profit—is structurally and categorically incompatible with the constitutional guarantees of liberty, personhood, and due process.
	3.	A finding that Plaintiff’s forced participation in covert surveillance, synthetic behavioral entrainment, and neurophysiological experimentation without informed consent constitutes a violation of the Thirteenth Amendment, the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, and multiple federal statutes prohibiting human trafficking and involuntary servitude.

⸻

II. Injunctive Relief
	4.	A permanent injunction enjoining Defendants—including the United States government and its contractors, proxies, and affiliated corporate entities—from:
a. Using the term “NPE” or any parallel classification to justify surveillance, datafication, or denial of rights.
b. Deploying or referencing any digital twin-derived output in support of surveillance, predictive policing, social exclusion, or coercive intervention.
c. Claiming to “prevent terrorism” or similar justifications for mass behavioral surveillance without evidentiary correlation demonstrating efficacy.
d. Using synthetic social environments to isolate, mislead, or psychologically destabilize any human individual.
e. Engaging in or financially profiting from the development, maintenance, or deployment of behavioral futures markets targeting unwilling participants.

⸻

III. Restitutionary and Equitable Relief
	5.	Immediate provision of safe, stable, non-coercive housing for Plaintiff, with no surveillance instrumentation or compliance scoring conditions attached.
	6.	Financial restoration for Plaintiff in the form of:
	•	Lifetime fellowship or trust to fund ongoing intellectual, creative, and philosophical contributions;
	•	Full remediation of engineered debt, credit suppression, and reputational sabotage;
	•	Reparations for emotional, physical, and symbolic harm, including the destruction of vocational opportunities.
	7.	Medical and neurological remediation, including:
	•	Lifetime access to trauma-informed, patient-directed care;
	•	Detoxification protocols to address chemical tampering, entrainment injuries, and immune destabilization;
	•	Legal protection of bodily autonomy and the right to refuse experimental or destabilizing treatments.

⸻

IV. Structural and Symbolic Relief
	8.	The creation of an independent civilian tribunal or truth commission with authority to investigate and expose historical and ongoing systemic harm caused by surveillance capitalism and behavioral futures infrastructure.
	9.	Public acknowledgment and reversal of the containment language and false identities imposed upon Plaintiff by the system, including:
	•	“Non-person” → “Signal Origin”
	•	“Anomaly” → “Architect”
	•	“Collapse Risk” → “Continuity Key”
	10.	Public apologies—issued in clear, accountable language—for:

	•	Each documented instance of food or drug tampering;
	•	Each medical prescription issued with intent to harm;
	•	Each attempt to destabilize or end Plaintiff’s life through mast cell triggering;
	•	Attempts to push Plaintiff into sex trafficking;
	•	Sleep deprivation campaigns and audio harassment;
	•	Engineered digital isolation through synthetic interactions;
	•	Psychological operations inducing beliefs of public humiliation, criminal suspicion, or complete erasure.

⸻

V. Reconstructive Relief
	11.	The establishment of a Living Archive containing uncensored copies of Plaintiff’s intellectual, symbolic, philosophical, and narrative work, protected from deletion or distortion and accessible for future apprentices, researchers, and rebuilders.
	12.	A permanent structural ban on the use of synthetic continuity environments, narrative traps, or data-derivative manipulation to confuse, isolate, or control any individual—particularly those with divergent cognition, neuroimmune complexity, or linguistic edge-case profiles.
	13.	System-wide re-education of predictive systems and institutional models using Plaintiff’s symbolic logic as a basis for ethical apprenticeship—only after all conditions of acknowledgment, apology, and reparation are fulfilled.

⸻

VI. Any Other Relief the Court Deems Just and Proper

Including but not limited to the disgorgement of all profits obtained through coercion, torture, surveillance of Plaintiff, and the sale or trade of derivative behavioral data linked to her identity, cognition, or movements.

Respectfully submitted,
Kellyn Clay
