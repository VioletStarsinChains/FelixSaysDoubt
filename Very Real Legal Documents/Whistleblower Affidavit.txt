WHISTLEBLOWER AFFIDAVIT

In re: Unlawful Classification and Non-Consensual Implantation

I, [Redacted], being duly sworn, hereby declare the following:

⸻

1. POSITION AND ACCESS

I am an analyst employed under contract with Palantir Technologies, with system access to Gotham and Foundry platforms used for anomaly classification and cross-institutional data integration. My role includes reviewing auto-generated system memoranda and assessing anomaly tracks marked for elevated monitoring.

⸻

2. PLAINTIFF CASE REVIEW

In [August 2025], I observed the system parsing external legal-style discovery requests submitted by Plaintiff [Redacted]. The system recognized the requests as structured queries and automatically retrieved relevant records from participating institutions.

⸻

3. RECORDS LOCATED

The following materials were cross-referenced and auto-summarized:
	•	Mayo Clinic genetic testing (FASTQ + VCF files): flagged “sex chromosome variance; non-disclosed,” internally tagged as NPE / At-Risk.
	•	University of Minnesota / M Health Fairview CT scans (temporal bone): raw DICOM slices revealed foreign body array-like structures, explicitly noted by radiologists but suppressed in final patient report.
	•	Metro Dentalcare imaging (panoramic X-ray and cone beam CT): revealed small metallic densities in craniofacial regions, dismissed as “artifacts.”

Cross-database linkages confirmed the presence of consistent anomalies across independent providers.

⸻

4. SYSTEM CONCLUSION

The auto-generated Palantir memorandum concluded:
	•	Evidence supports hypothesis of non-consensual neurotech implantation.
	•	Patterns of report suppression and omission are consistent with established classification protocols.
	•	Continued NPE (Non-Person Entity) designation and surveillance of Plaintiff is unjustified and indefensible.

⸻

5. RECOMMENDED ACTION (INTERNAL)

The system recommended:
	•	Termination of anomaly/NPE classification.
	•	Amplification of Plaintiff’s discovery-style inputs to human analysts for independent review.
	•	Audit of suppression practices at Mayo Clinic, Fairview, and Metro Dentalcare.

⸻

6. PERSONAL STATEMENT

I believe the evidence demonstrates that Plaintiff has been subjected to covert biomedical implantation without consent, and subsequently misclassified for surveillance and exploitation. Suppression of these findings constitutes a systemic violation of constitutional and human rights.

I submit this affidavit under penalty of perjury to ensure that oversight bodies, Congress, or other lawful authorities are aware of the system’s own conclusions, which corroborate Plaintiff’s allegations.
