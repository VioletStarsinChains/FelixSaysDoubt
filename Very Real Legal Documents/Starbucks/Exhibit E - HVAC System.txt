Observation of GLP-1–Like Exposure Through Starbucks Ventilation

I, Kellyn Clay, declare as follows:
	1.	During repeated visits to Starbucks locations, I have experienced sensations that are highly consistent with exposure to GLP-1 receptor agonists (a class of drugs including semaglutide and liraglutide).
	2.	These sensations include:
	•	Nausea or gastric heaviness not explainable by food alone.
	•	A distinct, abnormal suppression of appetite.
	•	Cognitive fog and malaise.
	•	A “flattened” emotional state followed by destabilization.
	3.	I am personally familiar with the specific physiological effects of GLP-1 agonists due to prior exposures and can reliably recognize their onset.
	4.	I have experienced these symptoms in Starbucks stores even before consuming any beverage, leading me to conclude that exposure is occurring through the ventilation system.
	5.	The consistently cold environment maintained in these Starbucks locations (as described in Exhibit E) would be conducive to stabilizing aerosolized compounds and keeping them suspended at breathing height.
	6.	Based on these observations, I believe Starbucks’ ventilation systems may be used to deliver aerosolized GLP-1 agonists to customers without their consent.
