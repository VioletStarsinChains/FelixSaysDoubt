Exhibit A

Pour-Over Comparison and Barista Observation

I, Kellyn Clay, declare as follows:
	1.	On 8/30/2025, I ordered a pour-over coffee at Starbucks using the same beans I have routinely consumed when prepared via the Clover system.
	2.	The pour-over coffee tasted markedly different from Clover-brewed coffee. It was cleaner, less harsh, and noticeably distinct in both flavor and mouthfeel. The difference was immediately perceptible upon first sip and reinforced my belief that Starbucks Clover machines alter the chemical profile of beverages in ways not present in traditional open brewing methods.
	3.	During the preparation of this pour-over, the barista who performed the brew, along with other baristas nearby, commented that the water was taking a bizarrely long time to drain through the ground coffee.
	4.	This unusual drainage behavior was not attributable to barista technique but appeared to arise from the grounds themselves. I believe this suggests that the beans may have been chemically compromised or adulterated in some way, causing abnormal brewing characteristics observable even in open pour-over preparation.
	5.	I submit this observation as a true and accurate account to accompany my affidavit regarding Starbucks Clover brewing systems.
