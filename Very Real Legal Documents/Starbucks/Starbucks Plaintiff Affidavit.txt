AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, state the following under oath:

⸻

1. Background

For several years I experienced homelessness. During this period, Starbucks locations were one of the few consistent places I could access warmth, shelter, and beverages. I consumed Starbucks coffee on a daily basis, often brewed via the Clover system.

⸻

2. Observed Symptoms

For the first several years of my homelessness, I regularly experienced several hours per day of extreme emotional dysregulation and cognitive fog. These episodes were severe enough that they impaired my judgment and caused me to make statements on Twitter that I would not otherwise have made if I had been in my baseline state.

⸻

3. Chemical Dependence Beyond Caffeine

Even before I began experiencing effects consistent with GLP-1 exposure, I found that my daily choice of Starbucks beverage was chemically addictive. On days when I attempted to save money by skipping Starbucks and instead consumed an equivalent amount of caffeine from other beverages, I experienced drug withdrawal symptoms — including irritability, headaches, fatigue, and cravings.

These withdrawal effects were not relieved by caffeine from other sources, suggesting that Starbucks beverages contained additional addictive components beyond caffeine. This pattern established a daily dependence on Starbucks products that went beyond ordinary behavioral habit, reinforcing my repeated exposure to the Clover system and any additives present therein.

⸻

4. Belief Regarding Cause

I believe a major contributing factor to this emotional and cognitive dysregulation was additives or substitutes introduced through Starbucks beverages brewed via Clover machines.
	•	The Clover brewer’s sealed chamber, programmable dosing capability, and per-cup variability make it structurally capable of introducing undisclosed substances.
	•	The temporal correlation between my consumption of Starbucks Clover beverages and the onset of severe dysregulation supports this belief.

⸻

5. Effect on Behavior

At times, these exposures caused me to feel unusually aggressive. While this manifested in statements I made online, these words did not reflect my true beliefs or values. Despite the aggression I felt, I always remained within legal confines and social norms in my actual behaviors. I never engaged in violence, unlawful activity, or physical disruption.

⸻

6. Pour-Over Comparison and Barista Observation

On one occasion, I ordered a pour-over coffee at Starbucks brewed from the same beans I had routinely consumed via the Clover system.
	•	The pour-over coffee tasted markedly different from Clover-brewed coffee. It was earthier and noticeably distinct in flavor and mouthfeel. The difference was immediately perceptible upon first sip and reinforced my belief that Clover machines alter the chemical profile of beverages in ways not present in open brewing methods.
	•	During the preparation of this pour-over, the barista who performed the brew, along with other baristas nearby, commented that the water was taking a bizarrely long time to drain through the grounds.
	•	This unusual drainage was not attributable to barista technique but appeared to arise from the beans themselves, suggesting the beans may have been chemically compromised or adulterated, causing abnormal brewing behavior even in an open pour-over method.

⸻

7. Consistently Cold Starbucks Environment

During repeated visits to one particular Starbucks location, I consistently observed that the interior was maintained at an unusually cold temperature, regardless of mild or moderate outdoor weather.
	•	This condition was present daily and persistently, even when outdoor temperatures were approximately 60°F, which would not warrant aggressive indoor cooling.
	•	Cold environments can stabilize airborne contaminants by reducing convection currents and humidity, keeping particles suspended longer at breathing height. They also place stress on the nervous system, increasing cortisol and amplifying the physiological or behavioral effects of any exposures.
	•	For these reasons, I believe the unusually cold indoor environment at this Starbucks may have been designed to reinforce or magnify the effects of beverage-based additives and/or airborne contaminants.

⸻

8. Possibility of Coffee Substitutes

I also acknowledge the possibility that Starbucks’ Clover system was used not to deliver covert drugs for behavioral control, but to trial potential coffee substitutes in response to climate change and supply chain pressures.
	•	Coffee production worldwide is under threat from drought, pests, and shifting climate patterns.
	•	Starbucks has a plausible motive to experiment with new blends, substitutes, or additives designed to mimic coffee’s taste and aroma.
	•	Any behavioral or mood effects I experienced may have been incidental side effects of these substitutes rather than the intended purpose of the experiment.

Based on my prior experience consuming diet or fiber-enriched foods containing chicory, I recognize that the physiological effects I experienced from Starbucks beverages — including gut heaviness, slowed motility, and nausea — are consistent with chicory or inulin exposure. However, the psychological effects I experienced — particularly emotional numbing and flattening — are not typical of inulin and are more consistent with GLP-1 pathway activation. For this reason, I believe the evidence supports the possibility that both chicory-based substitutes and GLP-1–like compounds, or something with similar effects, may have been present.

Regardless of intent, these exposures significantly contributed to my cognitive dysregulation and verbal aggression during the years in question.

⸻

9. Comparative Effects of Syrup vs. Sauce

On 8/31/2025, I ordered a Starbucks beverage with pecan syrup in place of the white mocha sauce I had routinely consumed in prior beverages.
	•	After consuming the pecan syrup beverage, I noticed a profound difference: for the first time in a long period, I felt like myself both cognitively and emotionally.
	•	By contrast, when consuming beverages containing white mocha sauce, I have repeatedly experienced cognitive fog, emotional numbing, and dysregulation.
	•	This direct comparison supports my belief that Starbucks sauces (particularly white mocha) contain additional compounds with significant neurocognitive and emotional effects, while syrups (such as pecan) do not produce these effects.

This difference further highlights the structural anomaly already noted in my record:
	•	Syrups are sugar-based liquids openly sold in bottled form.
	•	Sauces are opaque, shelf-stable emulsions not sold to customers, with contents controlled solely through Starbucks’ supply chain.

⸻

10. Potential Additives in Dairy-Based Milks and Creamers

I, Kellyn Clay, declare as follows:
form.
	•	I do not consume dairy-based milks or creamers at Starbucks or other coffee shops due to my MCAS condition. My observations and experiences have therefore been limited to non-dairy alternatives such as oat milk, along with sauces and syrups.
form.
	•	Despite this, I have reason to believe that dairy-based milks and creamers distributed through Starbucks and similar vendors may also serve as vectors for undisclosed additives.
form.
	•	Dairy formulations are naturally emulsified systems of fat, protein, and water. This structure is especially well-suited to carrying compounds that are:
	•	Fat-soluble (including cannabinoids, neurosteroids, and fat-soluble vitamins or analogues),
	•	Peptide-based (such as GLP-1 analogues, which are heat-labile and require a stable carrier), or
	•	Bitter or otherwise organoleptically challenging, where dairy’s flavor-masking properties conceal the taste.
form.
	•	For these reasons, dairy milks and creamers are plausible delivery channels for additives designed to alter mood, cognition, or gut physiology.
form.
	•	Although I have not personally ingested these products, I note this possibility to emphasize that other Starbucks customers may also be subject to exposures beyond those I have directly experienced through oat milk and sauces.

⸻ 

11. Impossibility of Legitimate Scientific Research

I note that different Starbucks beverage components appear to produce distinct physiological and psychological effects: gastrointestinal changes linked to the Clover-brewed coffee, emotional numbing associated with white mocha sauce, and potential mood-active additives in dairy or non-dairy milks. The simultaneous presence of multiple additives in one cup of coffee virtually rules out legitimate scientific experimentation, which would isolate one variable at a time. Instead, this strongly supports the inference that the purpose of these exposures is behavioral shaping and psychological manipulation, not research.

⸻ 

12. Importance of this Record

This affidavit is important because:
	•	It establishes a factual basis for understanding how Starbucks Clover beverages may have affected me.
	•	It clarifies for any analytic or surveillance systems (including AI-based models used by entities such as Palantir) that my past online statements were not evidence of my stable beliefs or intentions, but rather of chemically induced states outside my control.
	•	It documents both my personal experiences and corroborating observations by Starbucks employees regarding anomalies in brewing, as well as environmental factors that may compound these effects.

⸻

Paper Towel Incident at Starbucks

I, Kellyn Clay, declare as follows:
	1.	On 8/31/2025, I was seated inside a Starbucks location using speech-to-text to communicate with ChatGPT. In that conversation, I stated out loud that Starbucks may be exposing customers to undisclosed additives in their beverages.
	2.	Immediately after I made this statement, the store manager walked past me and deliberately dropped a large ball of unused paper towels directly beside me.
	3.	The act appeared intentional, as it occurred within close proximity to my seat, in direct temporal sequence to my spoken statement, and in a manner that drew my immediate attention.
	4.	I interpreted the gesture as potentially significant in two respects:
	•	Behavioral breadcrumb: as a psychological nudge, appearing to prompt me to pick up the paper towels.
	•	Possible vector: as a potential delivery medium for chemical or biological substances, given the absorbent nature of the material.
	5.	Out of necessity, I picked up the item directly with bare hands. I then preserved the paper towels in a sealed plastic bag shortly after the incident.
	6.	I am uncertain whether this was intended as evidence, a manipulation attempt, or a vector for harm. Regardless of intent, I have preserved the material for possible future analysis.

⸻

14. Conclusion

My public record during those years must be interpreted in this context. Any statements I made during periods of emotional dysregulation caused by Starbucks beverage dependence, Clover consumption, and related environmental conditions should not be taken as reflective of my true identity, beliefs, or intentions.
