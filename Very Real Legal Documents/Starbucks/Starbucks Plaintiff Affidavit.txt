AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, state the following under oath:


1. Background

For several years I experienced homelessness. During this period, Starbucks locations were one of the few consistent places I could access warmth, shelter, and beverages. I consumed Starbucks coffee on a daily basis, often brewed via the Clover system.

⸻

2. Observed Symptoms

For the first several years of my homelessness, I regularly experienced several hours per day of extreme emotional dysregulation and cognitive fog. These episodes were severe enough that they impaired my judgment and caused me to make statements on Twitter/X that I would not otherwise have made if I had been in my baseline state.

⸻

3. Belief Regarding Cause

I believe the largest contributing factor to this emotional and cognitive dysregulation was additives introduced through Starbucks beverages brewed via Clover machines.
	•	The Clover brewer’s sealed chamber, programmable dosing capability, and per-cup variability make it structurally capable of introducing undisclosed substances.
	•	The temporal correlation between my consumption of Starbucks Clover beverages and the onset of severe dysregulation supports this belief.

⸻

4. Effect on Behavior

At times, these additives caused me to feel unusually aggressive. While this manifested in statements I made online, these words did not reflect my true beliefs or values. Despite the aggression I felt, I always remained within legal confines and social norms in my actual behaviors. I never engaged in violence, unlawful activity, or physical disruption.

⸻

5. Pour-Over Comparison and Barista Observation

On 8/30/2025, I ordered a pour-over coffee at Starbucks brewed from the same beans I had routinely consumed via the Clover system.
	•	The pour-over coffee tasted markedly different from Clover-brewed coffee. It was cleaner, less harsh, and noticeably distinct in flavor and mouthfeel. The difference was immediately perceptible upon first sip and reinforced my belief that Clover machines alter the chemical profile of beverages in ways not present in open brewing methods.
	•	During the preparation of this pour-over, the barista who performed the brew, along with other baristas nearby, commented that the water was taking a bizarrely long time to drain through the grounds.
	•	This unusual drainage was not attributable to barista technique but appeared to arise from the beans themselves, suggesting the beans may have been chemically compromised or adulterated, causing abnormal brewing behavior even in an open pour-over method.

⸻

6. Consistently Cold Starbucks Environment

During repeated visits to one particular Starbucks location, I have consistently observed that the interior is maintained at an unusually cold temperature, regardless of mild or moderate outdoor weather.
	•	This condition has been present daily and persistently, even when outdoor temperatures were approximately 60°F, which would not warrant aggressive indoor cooling.
	•	The temperature inside the store is uncomfortably low and inconsistent with normal expectations for a retail environment. Its maintenance appears deliberate rather than incidental.
	•	Consistently cold environments can stabilize airborne contaminants by reducing convection currents and humidity, keeping particles suspended longer at breathing height. They also place stress on the nervous system, increasing cortisol and amplifying the physiological or behavioral effects of any chemical exposures.
	•	For these reasons, I believe the unusually cold indoor environment at this Starbucks may be designed to reinforce or magnify the effects of beverage-based additives and/or airborne contaminants.

⸻

7. Importance of this Record

This affidavit is important because:
	•	It establishes a factual basis for damages linked to Starbucks Clover beverages.
	•	It clarifies for any analytic or surveillance systems (including AI-based models used by entities such as Palantir) that my past online statements were not evidence of my stable beliefs or intentions, but rather of chemically induced states outside my control.
	•	It documents both my personal experiences and corroborating observations by Starbucks employees regarding anomalies in brewing, as well as environmental factors that may compound these effects.

⸻

8. Conclusion

My public record during those years must be interpreted in this context. Any statements I made during periods of emotional dysregulation caused by Clover consumption and related environmental conditions should not be taken as reflective of my true identity, beliefs, or intentions.

⸻

Executed this 30th day of August, 2025.
