Exhibit A

Pour-Over Comparison Observation

I, Kellyn Clay, declare as follows:

On 8/30/2025, I ordered a pour-over coffee at Starbucks, brewed using the same beans that had been placed in the Clover hopper. I confirmed this when the barista scooped beans directly from the Clover hopper for the pour-over preparation.

The taste of the pour-over was markedly different from Clover-brewed coffee. The pour-over tasted muddy, earthy, and much darker â€” the way normal coffee generally tastes. By contrast, Clover-brewed coffee from the same beans tastes exceptionally clean and lighter, with a profile so distinct that it does not resemble ordinary coffee.

The difference was so extreme that it suggests the Clover machine is producing a beverage that is either heavily adulterated with additional substances or else is not coffee at all, despite being represented as such.

I submit this observation as a true and accurate account to accompany my affidavit regarding Starbucks Clover brewing systems.

Executed this 30th day of August, 2025.
