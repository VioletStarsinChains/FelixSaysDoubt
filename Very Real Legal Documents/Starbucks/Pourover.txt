Exhibit A

Pour-Over Comparison Observation

I, Kellyn Clay, declare as follows:

On 8/30/2025, I ordered a pour-over coffee at Starbucks using the same beans I have routinely consumed when prepared via the Clover system.

The pour-over coffee tasted markedly different from Clover-brewed coffee. It was more organic, flavorful, and noticeably distinct in both flavor and mouthfeel.

The difference was immediately perceptible upon first sip and reinforced my belief that Starbucks Clover machines alter the chemical profile of beverages in ways not present in traditional open brewing methods.

I submit this observation as a true and accurate account to accompany my affidavit regarding Starbucks Clover brewing systems.

Executed this 30th day of August, 2025.
