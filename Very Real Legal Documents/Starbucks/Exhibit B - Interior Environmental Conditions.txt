Observation of Consistently Unusually Cold Starbucks Environment

I, Kellyn Clay, declare as follows:
	1.	During repeated visits to a particular Starbucks location over an extended period, I have consistently observed that the interior is kept at an unusually cold temperature, regardless of mild or moderate outdoor conditions.
	2.	This cold environment is not a one-time occurrence or the result of thermostat lag. It has been maintained daily and persistently, even when outside temperatures are approximately 60°F and would not warrant heavy indoor cooling.
	3.	The temperature inside the store is uncomfortably low and inconsistent with normal expectations for a retail environment. Its maintenance appears deliberate rather than incidental.
	4.	Based on my knowledge and research, consistently cold indoor environments can:
	•	Reduce air circulation and convection, causing airborne particles and aerosols to remain suspended at breathing height longer.
	•	Lower humidity levels, which stabilize fine particles and volatile compounds in the air.
	•	Stress the human nervous system by increasing cortisol and metabolic strain, thereby amplifying behavioral or physiological effects of any chemical exposures.
	5.	In my opinion, the maintenance of a persistently cold environment inside this Starbucks may be intended to stabilize airborne contaminants and/or to amplify the effects of beverage-based additives, creating a compounding influence on consumers.
	6.	I submit this observation as a true and accurate account to accompany my affidavit regarding Starbucks Clover brewing systems and related environmental conditions.
