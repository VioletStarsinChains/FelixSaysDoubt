Starbucks Blonde Roast Availability and Receipt Transparency Anomalies

I, Kellyn Clay, declare as follows:
	1.	On multiple occasions, I ordered Veranda (Blonde Roast) coffee at two Starbucks locations where I alternate daily visits:
	•	Hwy 36 & Fairview Avenue
	•	Cleveland & County Road C
	2.	In the Starbucks mobile application, Veranda (Blonde Roast) was listed as “Not available” at the Hwy 36 & Fairview Avenue location. Screenshots documenting this message are attached.
	3.	Despite this digital message of unavailability, when I entered the store in person, baristas sold me Blonde Roast without hesitation. Receipts confirm that I purchased brewed coffee at that location on the same dates the app showed it as unavailable.
	4.	In comparing receipts from the two locations, I noted a further discrepancy:
	•	At the Cleveland & County Road C store, my receipt included detailed line items identifying Veranda Blend and even add-ons (e.g., “4 White Chocolate Mocha Sauce”).
	•	At the Hwy 36 & Fairview Avenue store, my receipt included only a generic line item: “Starbucks product.” No detail was provided regarding which coffee was purchased.
	5.	This raises two anomalies:
	•	Digital vs. Physical Inconsistency: The app represented Blonde Roast as unavailable, while in-store staff provided it as available.
	•	Receipt Transparency Inconsistency: One store generated detailed receipts specifying product names and add-ons; the other generated only vague, non-descriptive receipts.
	6.	In my opinion, these anomalies are not random technical glitches. The suppression of availability data in the app and the use of generic receipt line items may serve to obscure product tracking and consumer verification, particularly with respect to beverages such as Blonde Roast and add-ons like White Mocha sauce.
	7.	These practices interfere with a customer’s ability to verify what they have purchased and consumed. They also raise concerns regarding traceability, accountability, and potential liability shielding in the event of health or safety complaints.
