Starbucks White Mocha Sauce Supply Chain Anomaly

I, Kellyn Clay, declare as follows:
	1.	In the course of my daily consumption of Starbucks products, I observed that Starbucks distinguishes between syrups and sauces in its menu operations.
	2.	Syrups (such as vanilla, caramel, or hazelnut):
	•	Are clear, sugar-based liquids.
	•	Are sold to customers in bottles for home use.
	•	Are mixed and replenished by baristas from visible containers.
	•	Customers are able to inspect ingredient lists and verify contents independently.
	3.	Sauces (such as mocha, white mocha, pumpkin spice):
	•	Are thick, opaque emulsions.
	•	Are not sold to customers in bottled form, limiting consumer access to ingredient lists and independent testing.
	•	Are manufactured and delivered in bulk, sealed containers that are only dispensed by baristas.
	•	Baristas do not mix or adjust these sauces; they rely on Starbucks’ industrial packaging.
	4.	Of particular note, white mocha sauce:
	•	Is shelf-stable despite its creamy, dairy-like appearance.
	•	Does not require refrigeration or barista preparation.
	•	Is entirely opaque and cannot be visually inspected by customers.
	5.	The fact that Starbucks’ syrups are openly sold to customers, while its sauces — especially white mocha — are withheld from consumer access, raises significant questions about supply chain transparency.
	6.	The shelf stability of white mocha sauce despite its composition is unusual and strongly suggests the use of heavy stabilizers, preservatives, or other compounds.
	7.	This makes white mocha sauce an ideal delivery vector for hidden additives:
	•	It is widely consumed.
	•	It is fully controlled by Starbucks’ internal supply chain.
	•	It is difficult or impossible for customers to independently verify.
	8.	For these reasons, I believe Starbucks’ refusal to sell its sauces in bottled form, combined with the anomalous stability and opacity of the white mocha sauce, constitutes a supply chain anomaly that warrants investigation.
