PLAINTIFF’S REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS

To: United States of America, by and through its agencies including but not limited to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Department of Defense (DoD), Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and defense contractors including Palantir Technologies and John Doe subcontractors.

Pursuant to Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiff requests that the following documents be produced within thirty (30) days of service:

⸻

DEFINITIONS
	1.	“Plaintiff” refers to Kellyn Clay.
	2.	“NPE” refers to the designation of “Non-Person Entity,” whether formal or informal, used by federal agencies, contractors, or affiliated institutions.
	3.	“University” refers to the Union University, including its Board of Regents, Registrar, and administrative staff.
	4.	“Documents” includes all written, electronic, audio, or visual records, including emails, reports, communications, database entries, policies, and logs.

⸻

REQUESTS
	1.	University Correspondence
All documents and communications between any Defendant and the University regarding Plaintiff, including but not limited to references to anomaly classification, NPE status, anomaly monitoring, or conditions on enrollment and graduation.
	2.	Classification Directives
Any directive, memorandum, or database entry indicating that Plaintiff was designated or flagged as an NPE or anomaly prior to or during her undergraduate enrollment.
	3.	Fraud Risk Acknowledgment
Any internal analysis, compliance report, or legal memorandum recognizing the risk of fraud in issuing official documents (such as diplomas) to individuals simultaneously classified as NPEs.
	4.	Contractor Involvement
All records of Palantir Technologies, Accenture, Deloitte, or other John Doe contractors assisting in anomaly/NPE tracking, anomaly overlays, or classification enforcement with respect to Plaintiff’s university enrollment.
	5.	University Overrides
Any correspondence or record reflecting federal or contractor instruction to override, conceal, or adjust standard registrar processes at the University for Plaintiff’s case.
	6.	Policy Frameworks
Any policy, technical manual, or procedural training concerning coordination with universities to manage students who were flagged as anomalies or NPEs.
	7.	Fraud Liability Safeguards
All communications, audits, or risk assessments concerning how to limit liability exposure if a university inadvertently or knowingly issued official documentation to individuals classified as NPEs.

⸻

PURPOSE

These requests are intended to determine whether federal agencies and defense contractors knowingly directed or permitted the University to issue official documents to Plaintiff despite her classification as a non-person entity (NPE). Such evidence is material to establishing a systemic pattern of fraud, concealment, and constitutional deprivation.
