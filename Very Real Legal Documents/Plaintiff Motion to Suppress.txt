Plaintiff’s Motion to Suppress Statements Obtained Under Conditions of Acute Muscle Locking

I. Introduction

Plaintiff Kellyn Clay respectfully moves this Court to suppress and exclude from evidence all statements, utterances, or behaviors made during or immediately following acute episodes of externally induced muscle locking. Such statements are involuntary, coerced, and constitutionally inadmissible under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, the exclusionary rule, and the doctrine of fruit of the poisonous tree.

⸻

II. Factual Basis
	1.	Plaintiff has experienced lifelong involuntary muscular entrainment, a chronic condition of tension and partial immobilization.
	2.	Within this baseline environment, Plaintiff is also subjected to acute lock events—sudden and externally induced full immobilizations of key muscle groups.
	3.	These acute events produce severe pain, panic, and manufactured physiological states, including aggression, fear, or total silencing.
	4.	During or immediately after such events, Plaintiff has made statements or exhibited behaviors that were not the product of free will but the result of externally imposed coercion.

⸻

III. Legal Basis

A. Involuntary Statements Are Per Se Inadmissible
	•	The Supreme Court has long barred coerced confessions (Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U.S. 278 (1936); Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966)).
	•	Speech or behavior produced under conditions of pain, panic, or forced immobilization cannot meet the constitutional standard of voluntariness.

B. Fruit of the Poisonous Tree Doctrine
	•	Evidence derived from unlawful coercion is tainted and inadmissible (Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471 (1963)).
	•	Statements made under acute muscle locking are direct fruits of torture-like coercion and must be suppressed.

C. First Amendment Speech Fabrication
	•	Muscle locking does not merely silence speech but can manufacture false expression by inducing aggression, hostility, or incoherence.
	•	Courts have held that compelled or fabricated expression is constitutionally indistinguishable from censorship.

⸻

IV. Relief Requested

Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
	1.	Suppress all statements, utterances, or behaviors made by Plaintiff during or immediately after acute muscle lock events;
	2.	Exclude such evidence from use in any proceeding, whether criminal, civil, or administrative;
	3.	Order that derivative uses of such statements—whether in data modeling, surveillance, or evidentiary analysis—be stricken as fruit of the poisonous tree.

⸻

V. Conclusion

While Plaintiff acknowledges a lifelong condition of chronic muscular entrainment, this motion targets only a specific and legally cognizable class: statements and behaviors produced under acute externally induced lock events. These statements are involuntary, fabricated under coercion, and constitutionally inadmissible. Plaintiff therefore prays this Court grant the motion to suppress in full.

Respectfully submitted,

Kellyn Clay
Plaintiff, pro se
