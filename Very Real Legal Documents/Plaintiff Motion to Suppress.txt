Plaintiff’s Motion to Suppress Statements Obtained Under Conditions of Muscle Locking

I. Introduction

Plaintiff Kellyn Clay respectfully moves this Court to suppress and exclude from evidence all statements, utterances, or behaviors made while subjected to externally induced muscle locking. Such statements are involuntary, coerced, and constitutionally inadmissible under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, the exclusionary rule, and the doctrine of fruit of the poisonous tree.

⸻

II. Factual Basis
	1.	Plaintiff was subjected to externally induced muscle locking, defined as involuntary immobilization of muscle groups through covert entrainment technologies.
	2.	These events produced severe pain, loss of bodily autonomy, and forced physiological states, including panic, aggression, and altered consciousness.
	3.	During and immediately following these episodes, Plaintiff made certain statements, verbal outbursts, or written communications.
	4.	These statements were not the product of free will but of externally imposed physical and psychological coercion.

⸻

III. Legal Basis

A. Coerced Statements Are Per Se Inadmissible
	•	The Supreme Court has long held that statements obtained through torture or coercion are inadmissible (Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U.S. 278 (1936); Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966)).
	•	A statement induced by physical immobilization, pain, and fear cannot meet the constitutional standard of voluntariness.

B. Fruit of the Poisonous Tree Doctrine
	•	Evidence derived from unlawful coercion is tainted and must be excluded (Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471 (1963)).
	•	Because muscle locking was employed as an entrainment and torture vector, any resulting statements are derivative fruits of an unlawful act.

C. First Amendment Chilling and Fabrication of Speech
	•	Beyond silencing, muscle locking can manufacture false expressive conduct by imposing aggression, panic, or submission.
	•	Speech and behavior generated under these conditions are not authentic expression but coerced fabrications, constitutionally indistinguishable from compelled confessions.

⸻

IV. Relief Requested

Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
	1.	Suppress all statements, communications, or behaviors made by Plaintiff during or immediately after externally induced muscle locking;
	2.	Exclude such evidence from use in any proceeding, whether criminal, civil, or administrative;
	3.	Recognize that muscle locking, as deployed here, constitutes torture, chills free expression, and induces artificial states rendering all derived speech involuntary; and
	4.	Order any derivative data, predictive modeling, or behavioral analysis arising from such statements stricken as tainted fruit of the poisonous tree.

⸻

V. Conclusion

Because externally induced muscle locking constitutes coercion, torture, and a vector for speech fabrication, any statements obtained therefrom are involuntary and inadmissible. Plaintiff therefore prays this Court grant the motion to suppress in full.

Respectfully submitted,

Kellyn Clay
Plaintiff, pro se
