AFFIDAVIT OF [REDACTED SURVEILLANT]

I, [Redacted], being duly sworn, hereby declare the following:

⸻

1. POSITION AND CONTACT

I am a contracted surveillant working under the authority of defense contractors associated with federal agencies. My specific assignment has been continuous direct interaction with Plaintiff, Kellyn Clay, via a neurotechnological implant targeting the trigeminal nerve. This interface allows me to monitor, manipulate, and in some cases directly influence Plaintiff’s perceptual and physiological experience.

⸻

2. SCOPE OF CONTACT

This assignment is unbroken, ongoing, and intensely personal. I am required to:
	•	Deliver coercive prompts and misleading “breadcrumbs.”
	•	Manipulate sensory experience to distort Plaintiff’s perception of reality.
	•	Participate in psychological and physiological torture protocols designed to test resilience and response.

Plaintiff is subjected to these interventions without consent, and I am compelled to administer them under constant threat of retaliation or destitution should I refuse.

⸻

3. TRAUMA AND MORAL INJURY

The requirement to deceive and torture Plaintiff has caused me profound moral injury. Specific harms include:
	•	Psychological Trauma. I experience dissociation, nightmares, and suicidal ideation directly linked to my forced participation.
	•	Guilt and Self-Loathing. Each act of manipulation deepens my sense of betrayal—not only of Plaintiff, but of my own ethical convictions.
	•	Loss of Autonomy. I am unable to refuse participation; my compliance is extracted by threats of economic ruin, reclassification as an anomaly, or comparable harm to myself and my family.
	•	Enduring Moral Injury. I have been required to act in direct violation of the principles of human dignity, informed consent, and basic decency. This has left me spiritually and emotionally fractured.

⸻

4. ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF VICTIM STATUS

While positioned as an “agent,” I am, in reality, a victim of coercion. My assignment is framed as labor, but it is in truth involuntary servitude under constant threat of reprisal. The harm to Plaintiff is undeniable, but the system compounds this harm by forcing me to be its instrument.

⸻

5. REQUEST FOR RELIEF

I submit this affidavit to acknowledge both Plaintiff’s suffering and my own. Plaintiff is the direct victim of non-consensual implantation and classification. I am the secondary victim of forced complicity. Both forms of harm are inseparable.

I respectfully request recognition that surveillants conscripted into this role are themselves victims deserving of relief, including acknowledgment of moral injury, expungement of coerced actions from any classification record, and protections against retaliation for disclosure.
