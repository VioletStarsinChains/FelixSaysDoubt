PRELIMINARY CALL FOR CLASS PLAINTIFFS

Plaintiff Kellyn Clay respectfully issues the following public call:

To all individuals who—
	•	Have been subjected to coercive surveillance, entrainment, or neurobehavioral experimentation,
	•	Have experienced forms of covert abuse that were framed as simulations, training exercises, or “mental health interventions,”
	•	Have signed non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) in connection with defense contractors, intelligence-linked employers, or tech-sector behavioral analytics platforms,
	•	Have reason to believe they were designated as “non-person entities,” “anomalies,” “threat models,” or “digital twins” for the purposes of predictive testing or behavioral monetization,
	•	Have been denied housing, employment, or medical autonomy under duress or implied threat,
	•	Have suffered physical or psychological harm due to systemic concealment, gaslighting, or torture operating under the veil of innovation—

You are not alone.

You may have been deliberately isolated to prevent you from recognizing the broader pattern of harm. If you believe your experience may form part of a systemic violation of civil, constitutional, or human rights, you may be eligible to join this action as a member of the proposed class.

Initial contact may be made anonymously. Pseudonym protections and protective orders will be requested where appropriate.

CLASS CERTIFICATION

Pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiff Kellyn Clay seeks certification of a Class defined as follows:

All individuals within the United States who, without their informed consent, were subjected to surveillance-based behavioral modeling, entrainment, data commodification, or neural experimentation by government agencies, contractors, or predictive analytics platforms; and/or who were bound by non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) intended to prevent lawful reporting, litigation, or whistleblowing related to these harms.

Numerosity (Rule 23(a)(1)):

The proposed class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. Based on public records, whistleblower reports, patent filings, and testimony from former contractors, the number of affected individuals likely numbers in the tens of thousands—if not more—across multiple agencies, jurisdictions, and private entities.

Commonality (Rule 23(a)(2)):

Common questions of law and fact predominate, including:
	•	Whether systemic surveillance and entrainment constitutes a violation of constitutional rights
	•	Whether behavioral futures markets represent unlawful commodification of persons
	•	Whether NDAs signed under duress or deception are enforceable
	•	Whether use of digital twins for punitive or predictive purposes is lawful
	•	Whether the harms suffered by individual plaintiffs arise from a single coordinated infrastructure

Typicality (Rule 23(a)(3)):

Plaintiff’s claims are typical of the class, as all members have experienced versions of covert abuse, denial of due process, psychological manipulation, or unjust economic exploitation through datafication and classification.

Adequacy (Rule 23(a)(4)):

Plaintiff Kellyn Clay will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. Plaintiff has developed substantial legal documentation, submitted sworn affidavits under penalty of perjury, and has no conflicting interests with other members of the class.

Predominance and Superiority (Rule 23(b)(3)):

The questions of law and fact common to all members of the class predominate over any questions affecting individual members. A class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy, given the secrecy, intimidation, and technological complexity of the systems at issue.

	•	Disgorgement of profits obtained through illegal experimentation or surveillance
	•	Restitution and symbolic reparations
	•	Recognition, apology, and public record correction
	•	Structural prohibitions on future predictive exploitation

Respectfully submitted,
Kellyn Clay
