Opinion and Order

Before the Court is Plaintiff’s Motion for Permanent Injunction.

The Court finds:
	1.	The malicious or neglectful use of technological surveillance and biomanipulation systems inflicts torture, chills speech, and manufactures false expression;
	2.	Such conduct violates the Eighth Amendment, the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments’ due process protections, and international law norms;
	3.	Equity requires permanent removal of malicious actors from access to the instruments of their abuse.

Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that:
	•	Any surveillant who acts with malice or neglect shall have their access to surveillance or biomanipulation systems permanently revoked;
	•	Revocation is a protective measure, not retaliatory, and shall not be grounds for reclassification as an anomaly, Non-Person Entity (NPE), or analogous designation;
	•	Former surveillants remain entitled to full constitutional protections;
	•	Prohibited surveillance or biomanipulation tools shall not be deployed against them.

SO ORDERED.
