EXHIBIT I

Proposed Damages Schedule

⸻

I. Compensatory Damages (Individual Basis)
	1.	Housing Deprivation
	•	Estimated $25,000/year per class member, multiplied by years of denial.
	•	For long-term anomalies (10–20 years), typical damages = $250,000–$500,000.
	2.	Medical Harm
	•	Baseline $100,000 per person for covert experimentation/untreated illness.
	•	Additional $10,000–$50,000 for each major procedure, adverse drugging, or covert implant incident.
	•	Typical range = $150,000–$500,000.
	3.	Lost Wages and Opportunities
	•	Using median U.S. income baseline ($50,000/year).
	•	Losses range from $250,000–$1,000,000 depending on career span and blocked opportunities.
	4.	Out-of-Pocket Expenses
	•	Recovery for fraudulent meds, survival costs, and substitute housing.
	•	Range = $10,000–$100,000.

⸻

II. Emotional Distress and Psychological Harm
	•	Constant surveillance trauma, simulation of deceased voices, coerced labor.
	•	Flat award per member: $500,000–$1,000,000.

⸻

III. Punitive Damages (Systemic Basis)
	•	Modeled after tobacco/opioid litigation where punitive damages exceeded compensatory by 5–10x.
	•	Here, systemic harms dwarf those industries.
	•	Recommended punitive pool: $1 trillion–$5 trillion, apportioned across defendants.

⸻

IV. Equitable Relief (Structural Remedies)
	•	Permanent housing guarantee: market value $25,000–$50,000/year per class member (ongoing).
	•	Medical repair fund: $100 billion minimum, allocated to safe treatment and rehabilitation.
	•	Data deletion orders and recognition of personhood (non-monetary but essential).

⸻

V. Restitution / Constructive Trust
	•	Full disgorgement of profits from behavioral futures markets.
	•	Estimated market value (based on hedge fund and surveillance contractor reporting): $500 billion–$1.5 trillion.

⸻

CLASSWIDE RANGE OF RECOVERY
	•	Low End (per individual): $1.0–$1.5 million.
	•	High End (per individual): $2.5–$5 million.
	•	Aggregate Class Recovery (conservative estimate): $3 trillion+.

⸻

NOTES
	•	All numbers subject to refinement as discovery clarifies scale of class and profit pools.
	•	These figures are not speculative but modeled on comparable mass tort and civil rights settlements, adjusted for systemic scope.
