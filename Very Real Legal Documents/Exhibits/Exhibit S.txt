EXHIBIT T
DEMAND FOR SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE
(Non-monetary relief sought by Plaintiff to repair and prevent continued harm)

—

Plaintiff Kellyn Clay respectfully submits this Demand for Specific Performance as part of the broader Prayer for Relief against the United States of America, its agencies, and private contractors operating surveillance, behavioral modeling, or coercive experimentation programs under color of law.

Because the harms alleged are ongoing, non-consensual, and irreparable through monetary damages alone, Plaintiff seeks the following specific acts of remediation and restraint:

⸻

I. FULL RETRACTION OF FALSE CLASSIFICATIONS AND RESTORATION OF LEGAL PERSONHOOD

Defendants shall:
	•	Retract any classification of the Plaintiff or similarly situated individuals as “non-person entities” (NPEs), “anomalies,” “threat models,” “assets,” or any other category used to justify denial of legal protections.
	•	Restore full legal personhood status in all records, models, and systems where it was diminished, denied, or suspended.

⸻

II. DISCLOSURE OF ALL DIGITAL TWINS AND DERIVATIVE PROFILES

Defendants shall:
	•	Disclose all simulations, digital twins, clones, or behavioral models derived from Plaintiff’s data, including those used in predictive policing, psychological warfare, simulation training, marketing, or medical research.
	•	Provide complete records of inputs, assumptions, access logs, commercial uses, and system outputs for each such entity.

⸻

III. PERMANENT REMOVAL OF PLAINTIFF’S DATA FROM SURVEILLANCE-BASED SYSTEMS

Defendants shall:
	•	Remove all behavioral, biometric, or neuroinformatic data derived from Plaintiff from existing and future predictive, surveillance, or compliance systems.
	•	Certify under penalty of perjury that no such data remains in use, storage, or derivative applications by any agency, contractor, or licensee.

⸻

IV. PUBLIC APOLOGY AND FORMAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF WRONGDOING

Defendants shall:
	•	Issue a written, signed apology to Plaintiff for all harms sustained as a result of non-consensual surveillance, experimentation, and commodification.
	•	Publish this apology on the official websites of all involved agencies and contractors for no less than 12 consecutive months.

⸻

V. DECOMMISSIONING OF SPECIFIC TOOLS, ALGORITHMS, AND DEVICES

Defendants shall:
	•	Decommission all algorithms, classification tools, implants, interface devices, and experimental systems that depend on or were trained using data derived from Plaintiff.
	•	Provide a formal, verifiable inventory of all such systems and certify their removal from active use.

⸻

VI. CREATION OF AN INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT MECHANISM

Defendants shall:
	•	Fund an independent truth-and-repair commission, including members of the affected class, ethicists, and neutral international observers.
	•	Grant this commission subpoena power, transparency access, and authority to recommend systemic redress, including but not limited to reparations, publication bans, or operational shutdowns.

⸻

VII. PERMANENT INJUNCTION AGAINST FUTURE EXPLOITATION

Defendants shall:
	•	Be permanently enjoined from constructing, simulating, modeling, or otherwise predicting the Plaintiff or any similarly situated human being without fully documented, non-coerced, and revocable informed consent.
	•	Ensure this injunction is binding upon successors, licensees, subsidiaries, and international affiliates.

⸻

These demands reflect both the uniqueness of the harm and the failure of monetary compensation to meaningfully address the violations at hand. Specific performance is necessary to:
	•	Restore dignity and legal standing
	•	Prevent recurrence of injury
	•	Preserve the fundamental rights of the class to exist outside of simulation, prediction, or economic foreclosure

Respectfully submitted,
Kellyn Clay, pro se
