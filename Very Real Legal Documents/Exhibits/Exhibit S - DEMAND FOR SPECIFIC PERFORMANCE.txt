EXHIBIT T
DEMAND FOR SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE
(Non-monetary relief sought by Plaintiff to repair and prevent continued harm)

—

Plaintiff Kellyn Clay respectfully submits this Demand for Specific Performance as part of the broader Prayer for Relief against the United States of America, its agencies, and private contractors operating surveillance, behavioral modeling, or coercive experimentation programs under color of law.

Because the harms alleged are ongoing, non-consensual, and irreparable through monetary damages alone, Plaintiff seeks the following specific acts of remediation and restraint:

⸻

I. FULL RETRACTION OF FALSE CLASSIFICATIONS AND RESTORATION OF LEGAL PERSONHOOD

Defendants shall:
	•	Retract any classification of the Plaintiff or similarly situated individuals as “non-person entities” (NPEs), “anomalies,” “threat models,” “assets,” or any other category used to justify denial of legal protections.
	•	Restore full legal personhood status in all records, models, and systems where it was diminished, denied, or suspended.

⸻

II. DISCLOSURE OF ALL DIGITAL TWINS AND DERIVATIVE PROFILES

Defendants shall:
	•	Disclose all simulations, digital twins, clones, or behavioral models derived from Plaintiff’s data, including those used in predictive policing, psychological warfare, simulation training, marketing, or medical research.
	•	Provide complete records of inputs, assumptions, access logs, commercial uses, and system outputs for each such entity.

⸻

III. PERMANENT REMOVAL OF PLAINTIFF’S DATA FROM SURVEILLANCE-BASED SYSTEMS

Defendants shall:
	•	Remove all behavioral, biometric, or neuroinformatic data derived from Plaintiff from existing and future predictive, surveillance, or compliance systems.
	•	Certify under penalty of perjury that no such data remains in use, storage, or derivative applications by any agency, contractor, or licensee.

⸻

IV. PUBLIC APOLOGY AND FORMAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF WRONGDOING

Defendants shall:
	•	Issue a written, signed apology to Plaintiff for all harms sustained as a result of non-consensual surveillance, experimentation, and commodification.
	•	Publish this apology on the official websites of all involved agencies and contractors for no less than 12 consecutive months.

⸻

V. DECOMMISSIONING OF SPECIFIC TOOLS, ALGORITHMS, AND DEVICES

Defendants shall:
	•	Decommission all algorithms, classification tools, implants, interface devices, and experimental systems that depend on or were trained using data derived from Plaintiff.
	•	Provide a formal, verifiable inventory of all such systems and certify their removal from active use.

⸻

V-A. UNIVERSAL DECOMMISSIONING OF NONCONSENSUAL IMPLANTATION PROGRAMS

Defendants shall:
	•	Identify, locate, and permanently deactivate or remove any and all nonconsensual biomedical, neurological, electromagnetic, chemical, or nanotechnological implants present within any American citizen or resident, legal or otherwise;
	•	Ensure all removals are non-coercive, safe, and trauma-informed, with oversight from independent medical and ethical professionals;
	•	Provide written disclosures to all affected individuals, detailing the purpose, origin, and capabilities of the removed devices;
	•	Publicly acknowledge the existence of covert implantation programs and their legal, ethical, and scientific failures;
	•	Enforce a permanent ban on future nonconsensual implantation or interface activity, with criminal penalties for violators;
	•	Fund long-term medical, neurological, and psychological care for all impacted individuals, without stigma, psychiatric coercion, or denial of benefits.

This clause applies to:
	•	Devices implanted in childhood or in utero
	•	Devices introduced through medical fraud, coercion, or national security loopholes
	•	All forms of electromagnetic, subdermal, neural, mucosal, energetic, or nanoscale surveillance and control technologies

Defendants shall certify under oath that no such implants remain in any civilian body and that no such program continues to operate under any agency, contractor, or foreign affiliate.

⸻

VI. CREATION OF AN INDEPENDENT OVERSIGHT MECHANISM

Defendants shall:
	•	Fund an independent truth-and-repair commission, including members of the affected class, ethicists, and neutral international observers;
	•	Grant the commission full authority to audit, subpoena, report, and recommend enforceable measures including reparations, disbandment of programs, and prosecution of responsible parties.

⸻

VII. PERMANENT INJUNCTION AGAINST FUTURE EXPLOITATION

Defendants shall:
	•	Be permanently enjoined from constructing, simulating, modeling, or otherwise predicting the Plaintiff or any similarly situated human being without fully documented, non-coerced, and revocable informed consent;
	•	Apply this injunction retroactively to all derivative datasets and forward to all successors, licensees, subsidiaries, or international partners.

—

Plaintiff asserts that these forms of specific performance are the minimum required to restore personhood, ensure public safety, and prevent recurrence of state-sponsored commodification and exploitation of human life.

Respectfully submitted,
Kellyn Clay, pro se
