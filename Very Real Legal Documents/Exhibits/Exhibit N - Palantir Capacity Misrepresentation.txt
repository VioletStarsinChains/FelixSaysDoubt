Mass Shootings in the United States (2003–2025) vs. Palantir Expansion Timeline

Submitted in Support of Plaintiff’s Motion for Injunction

⸻

CAPTION

This exhibit presents evidence that Palantir Technologies Inc., despite extensive surveillance capabilities and access to highly sensitive behavioral, biometric, and geospatial data, has not been associated with any measurable reduction in U.S. mass shootings since its founding in 2003. The following outline compares yearly national mass shooting trends to the company’s key federal expansion milestones. This contrast undermines Palantir’s claim to “prevent terrorism” and suggests a failure—or unwillingness—to interrupt the most visible forms of domestic mass violence.
