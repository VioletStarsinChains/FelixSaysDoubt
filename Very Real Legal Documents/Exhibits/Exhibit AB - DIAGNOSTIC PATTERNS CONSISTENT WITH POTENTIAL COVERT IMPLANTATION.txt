EXHIBIT AB: DIAGNOSTIC PATTERNS CONSISTENT WITH POTENTIAL COVERT IMPLANTATION

I. Medical Diagnoses
	•	ME/CFS (Myalgic Encephalomyelitis / Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) — systemic energy collapse without explanatory pathology.
	•	POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome) — sudden dysautonomia without structural basis.
	•	Fibromyalgia — diffuse pain and tenderness, resistant to therapy.
	•	CRPS (Complex Regional Pain Syndrome) — disproportionate localized pain, sometimes migratory.
	•	Trigeminal Neuralgia — severe facial nerve pain without structural cause.
	•	Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (atypical/recurrent) — persistence without occupational explanation.
	•	Thoracic Outlet Syndrome — vascular/nerve compression near clavicle, resistant to correction.
	•	Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis — early autoimmune-like onset without genetic basis.
	•	Relapsing Polychondritis — recurrent cartilage inflammation.
	•	hEDS (Hypermobile Ehlers–Danlos Syndrome) — connective tissue fragility beyond genetic evidence.
	•	Localized Myositis/Fasciitis — idiopathic inflammation of muscle or fascia.
	•	Superior Canal Dehiscence Syndrome — abnormal bony thinning in the inner ear.
	•	Meniere’s Disease / Atypical Vestibular Syndromes — episodic vertigo without clear pathology.
	•	Atypical Migraine Variants (hemiplegic, vestibular, ocular) — severe neurological symptoms without lesions.
	•	Gastroparesis — unexplained paralysis of stomach muscles.
	•	IBS / Functional Bowel Disorders — resistant to interventions, idiopathic course.
	•	Dysphagia (unexplained swallowing difficulty) — episodic, migrating, non-structural.
	•	MCAS (Mast Cell Activation Syndrome) — chaotic immune reactivity without allergen.
	•	Lupus-like / UCTD (Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease) — autoantibody-negative but severe.
	•	Vasculitis (refractory) — inflammatory vessel changes without systemic autoimmunity.
	•	Raynaud’s Phenomenon (atypical) — vascular spasms without autoimmune correlation.
	•	Lymphedema (idiopathic, unilateral) — fluid accumulation without trauma.
	•	Obesity (discordant with lifestyle) — weight gain resistant to healthy behaviors.
	•	Adult-Onset Type I Diabetes — abrupt pancreatic failure in healthy adults.

II. Psychiatric / Behavioral Diagnoses Commonly Misapplied in Lieu of Explanation
	•	Conversion Disorder — historically used to dismiss unexplained neurological symptoms.
	•	Somatic Symptom Disorder — frames physiological illness as psychological by default.
	•	Factitious Disorder / Munchausen’s — invoked when conditions appear too complex or shifting.
	•	Borderline Personality Disorder — frequently applied when patients are resistant to invalidation or nonstandard care.
	•	Health Anxiety / Hypochondriasis — pathologizes persistent reporting of real but poorly recognized physiological problems.
	•	Functional Neurological Disorder — broad label that often substitutes for deeper investigation.

Interpretive Note:
The above list documents both medical and psychiatric diagnoses that are recurrently applied when individuals exhibit conditions consistent with covert implantation. These diagnoses are often characterized by:
	•	Onset in youth or early adulthood.
	•	Unilateral or localized presentations without structural injury.
	•	Resistant or refractory response to conventional treatment.
	•	Migratory or shifting symptom clusters.
	•	Use of psychiatric labels as diagnostic placeholders rather than evidence-based explanations.

Together, these patterns suggest a systemic tendency to reframe covert physiological interference as idiopathic or psychological, thereby concealing the underlying cause and enabling ongoing harm.
