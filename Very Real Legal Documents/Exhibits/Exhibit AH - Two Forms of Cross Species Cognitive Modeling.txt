EXHIBIT AH
Distinguishing Two Applications of Cross-Species Cognitive Modeling

Plaintiff submits this Exhibit to clarify the two distinct ways in which cross-species cognitive modeling has been applied to human subjects in anomaly and Non-Person Entity (NPE) classification systems. These applications differ in both method and legal consequence.

⸻

1. Inductive Alignment (Manipulation via Inputs)
	•	Definition: The deliberate application of external inputs (e.g., chemical exposures, electromagnetic fields, sensory environments) to induce behaviors in a human subject that align with animal models.
	•	Purpose: To artificially create a state in which a human demonstrates “animal-like” cognitive or behavioral patterns for study or exploitation.
	•	Legal Characterization: This constitutes human experimentation and manipulation of bodily and cognitive integrity without informed consent.

⸻

2. Deductive Comparison (Interpretation via Animal Baselines)
	•	Definition: The use of animal cognition models as analytical baselines for interpreting human behavioral data. Here, the human’s data are not altered directly, but the analysis treats the individual as though they were comparable to an animal subject (e.g., rabbit, crow, octopus).
	•	Purpose: To classify, categorize, or predict human behavior by downgrading it into nonhuman analogues.
	•	Legal Characterization: This constitutes discrimination in classification, denying individuals equal treatment by reframing them as “less than human” within predictive systems.

⸻

3. Key Distinction
	•	Inductive Alignment = Manipulation. Humans are forced into states resembling animal cognition.
	•	Deductive Comparison = Discrimination. Humans are interpreted as though they were animals, regardless of their true capacities.

Both methods lead to wrongful exclusion from the “predictive domain” and reinforce circular reasoning in anomaly/NPE pipelines, but they differ in how they achieve this: one by active intervention, the other by biased interpretation.
