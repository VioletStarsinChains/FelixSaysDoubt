EXHIBIT AI
On the Use of Fictional Animal Archetypes in Anomaly and NPE Classification Systems

Plaintiff submits this Exhibit to highlight the discriminatory and pseudoscientific use of fictional animal archetypes (e.g., unicorns, mythological tanuki, gnomes, dragons, fairies) in anomaly and Non-Person Entity (NPE) classification systems.

⸻

1. Distinction from Biological Models
	•	Biological animal models (e.g., rabbit, crow, octopus) at least draw from observable cognition and behavior.
	•	In contrast, mythological creatures (e.g., unicorns, trickster animals such as tanuki or kitsune) are fictional constructs representing symbolic or cultural traits rather than biological reality.

⸻

2. Archetypal Assignments
	•	Subjects are mapped onto archetypes to impose narrative-driven interpretations:
	•	Unicorns → framed as rare, untouchable, anomalous, and resistant to capture.
	•	Mythological tanuki → framed as shapeshifters or destabilizers, implying deception or volatility.
	•	These assignments do not reflect empirical data but rather cultural stereotypes embedded in predictive overlays.

⸻

3. Functional Role in Exclusion
	•	By imposing fictional archetypes, agencies and contractors create a symbolic justification for removing individuals from the human predictive domain.
	•	This technique compounds the injury of anomaly designation by weaponizing narrative imagery against the subject, portraying them as mythical or monstrous rather than human.

⸻

4. Evidence of Malice and Arbitrary Practice
	•	The use of fictional animals reveals that classification systems are not neutral or scientific, but arbitrary and prejudicial by design.
	•	Mythological assignments ensure that the excluded individual cannot contest the framing on rational grounds, as the archetypes themselves are fictional and unmeasurable.
	•	This practice demonstrates not only discrimination but also intentional ridicule and dehumanization.

⸻

5. Conclusion
The application of fictional animal archetypes in anomaly/NPE pipelines demonstrates malice, pseudoscience, and discriminatory narrative manipulation. Such practices cannot be justified as legitimate scientific modeling and further illustrate the systemic intent to degrade and exclude human beings through circular and arbitrary classification systems.
