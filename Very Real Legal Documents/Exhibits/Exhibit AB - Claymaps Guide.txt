GENERAL CLAYMAP INTERPRETATION GUIDE

Plaintiff: Kellyn Clay

Methodology:
	•	Calcium bentonite clay, prepared as a hydrated slurry, is applied directly to the skin over a defined area.
	•	The clay is allowed to dry under consistent environmental conditions before removal.
	•	Photographs are taken during or after drying to document visual changes in the clay surface.

Principle of Action:
	•	Calcium bentonite clay has high surface area and cation-exchange capacity, allowing it to bind charged particles, organic compounds, and certain metals.
	•	When applied to skin, the clay may interact with exudates, sweat, oils, or other localized byproducts of tissue metabolism and inflammation.
	•	These interactions alter drying patterns in ways that can be visually documented.

Interpretive Markers:
	•	Uniform light drying: suggests low localized interaction; the clay dries evenly without focal changes.
	•	Darkened patches: indicate areas of stronger adsorption or retention of fluid/compounds, suggesting higher concentration of exudates, inflammatory byproducts, or sequestered materials in underlying tissue.
	•	Persistently wet or tacky zones: may reflect localized fluid seepage or slowed evaporation, consistent with areas of lymphatic congestion or foreign-body–driven accumulation.
	•	Thickened or cracked areas: suggest localized differences in tissue outgassing, fluid release, or mineral interaction, which can alter the physical properties of the clay.

Significance:
	•	Claymapping does not identify specific compounds but provides a functional visual assay of tissue burden and fluid dynamics at the skin interface.
	•	Reproducible patterns of darker or wetter patches emerging at the same anatomical sites across sessions support the inference of persistent localized abnormalities (e.g., foreign bodies, mineralization, fibrosis, or chronic inflammation).
	•	When systematically documented, claymaps may serve as evidence of non-random, biologically meaningful patterns not attributable to random drying artifacts.

Conclusion:
Claymaps function as a low-technology, non-invasive imaging analogue. They provide visible, reproducible evidence of localized physiological differences, potentially linked to covert implantation, toxic accumulation, or inflammatory sequestration processes.
