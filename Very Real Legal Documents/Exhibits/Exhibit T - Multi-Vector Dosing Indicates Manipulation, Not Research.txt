Multi-Vector Dosing Indicates Manipulation, Not Research

I, Kellyn Clay, declare as follows:
	1.	Through repeated daily consumption of Starbucks beverages, I have observed that different beverage components appear to produce distinct physiological and psychological effects:
	•	Clover-brewed coffee and beans: gastrointestinal slowdown and heaviness.
	•	White mocha sauce: emotional numbing and flattening of affect.
	•	Dairy and non-dairy milks/creamers: potential carriers of additional mood-active or fat-soluble compounds.
	2.	When combined in a single beverage, these components produce stacked effects, with both gastrointestinal and psychological impacts occurring simultaneously.
	3.	In legitimate scientific research, exposures are designed to isolate one variable at a time in order to generate meaningful data. For example, chicory or inulin might be trialed as a coffee substitute, but the research design would test this additive alone, without concurrent confounding compounds.
	4.	By contrast, multi-vector dosing—introducing multiple undisclosed additives in one beverage—renders controlled analysis impossible and instead creates confusion, unpredictability, and overlapping effects.
	5.	For this reason, I believe the simultaneous use of multiple dosing vectors in Starbucks beverages virtually rules out benign research purposes. It instead strongly supports the inference that the intent of these exposures is behavioral shaping and psychological manipulation, not scientific experimentation.
	6.	Regardless of intent, such exposures are nonconsensual and violate the principle of informed consent. However, the use of multi-variable dosing underscores the conclusion that these practices are designed to coerce, destabilize, and manipulate rather than to further scientific understanding.
