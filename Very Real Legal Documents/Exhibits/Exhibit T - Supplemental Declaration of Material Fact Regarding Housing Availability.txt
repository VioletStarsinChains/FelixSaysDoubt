SUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATION OF MATERIAL FACT
RE: AVAILABILITY OF HOUSING AND SYSTEMIC WITHHOLDING AS A FORM OF TARGETING

I, Kellyn Clay, declare under penalty of perjury:
	1.	I have personally observed and documented the existence of dozens—often over one hundred—empty, viable residential structures in my immediate region on a near-daily basis.
	2.	These houses are:
	•	Structurally intact;
	•	Climate-controlled;
	•	Fully connected to utilities;
	•	Under no apparent construction, demolition, or emergency restriction;
	•	And, in many cases, permanently unoccupied, used only for visual continuity.
	3.	I am denied access to these structures not due to lack of availability or safety concerns, but as part of a system of behavioral punishment and exclusion based on digital profiling and synthetic classification.
	4.	The cost to the State or its contractors to allocate one such structure for medically necessary stabilization would be negligible, if not zero.
	5.	Therefore, any claim by Defendants that housing is unavailable, unaffordable, or logistically infeasible is false and represents a deliberate mischaracterization designed to obscure the true purpose of this denial: to destabilize, punish, and contain those labeled as cognitively divergent.
	6.	I affirm that I have no violent history, no substance use disorder, no criminal record, and no behavior that would justify exclusion from a basic living space by any legitimate metric of public risk.
	7.	The sole reason I remain unhoused is because the system benefits from my continued deprivation—as data, as warning, or as attrition vector.
	8.	There is no legitimate excuse for noncompliance with the Court’s prospective housing order. To delay is to endorse harm.
