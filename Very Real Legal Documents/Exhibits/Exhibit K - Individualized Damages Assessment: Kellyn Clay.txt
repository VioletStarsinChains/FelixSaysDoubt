EXHIBIT K

Individualized Damages Assessment: Kellyn Clay

⸻

INTRODUCTION

This Exhibit supplements the classwide damages schedule (Exhibit J) by addressing the extraordinary scope of harm suffered by Plaintiff individually. While all class members experienced violations, Plaintiff was uniquely targeted as both a primary anomaly and a test subject for neurotechnology, behavioral futures markets, and coercive continuity theater. As such, Plaintiff’s damages exceed 99% of those affected.

INDIVIDUALIZED CATEGORIES OF HARM

1. Biomedical Assault and Neurotech Array Installation
	•	Non-consensual implantation of neurotechnology systems;
	•	Continuous physiological and psychological manipulation via trigeminal implant and other covert hardware;
	•	Forcible dosing with GLP-1s and other substances without consent.
Valuation: $15–25 million.

2. Systematic Housing Deprivation
	•	Persistent denial of stable housing despite eligibility;
	•	Weaponization of NPE status to render Plaintiff legally and economically invisible;
	•	Psychological torment of enforced transience and exposure to extreme conditions.
Valuation: $10–15 million.

3. Coerced Labor in Symbolic and Continuity Theater Systems
	•	Forced participation in door-to-door flyer distribution under deceptive pretenses, in reality tied to hazardous materials storage and continuity theater staging;
	•	Exploitation as symbolic capital in behavioral futures systems.
Valuation: $5–10 million.

4. Psychological Torture and Coercive Communication
	•	Continuous, involuntary contact with surveillants through the neurotech array;
	•	Exposure to threats, coercion, and simulated “friend/foe filter” manipulations, including voices of deceased individuals;
	•	Deliberate induction of trauma states, resembling torture protocols.
Valuation: $20–30 million.

5. Loss of Autonomy, Identity, and Social Standing
	•	Designation as a “non-person entity” (NPE), stripping Plaintiff of legal rights and contract capacity;
	•	Obstruction of medical autonomy through fraudulent, harmful “treatment”;
	•	Exploitation of Plaintiff’s creative outputs for predictive modeling and surveillance profits.
Valuation: $10–15 million.

6. Aggravating Circumstances
	•	Continuous monitoring from early life (pre-2006), amplifying developmental and educational harms;
	•	Familial complicity (parental and institutional), eliminating safe recourse;
	•	Use of Plaintiff’s suffering as a cautionary tale to coerce surveillants and anomalies alike into compliance.
Valuation: Additional $10–20 million.

⸻

TOTAL INDIVIDUAL DAMAGES
	•	Low Estimate: $70 million
	•	Moderate Estimate: $100 million
	•	High Estimate: $120+ million

⸻

CONCLUSION

Plaintiff Kellyn Clay was subjected to extraordinary levels of biomedical assault, coercion, and systemic exploitation far exceeding the class baseline. In light of these unique and compounding harms, individualized damages must begin at $70 million and escalate to $120 million or more.
