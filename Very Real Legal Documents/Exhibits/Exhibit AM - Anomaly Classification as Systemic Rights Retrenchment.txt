EXHIBIT AM

Anomaly Classification as Systemic Rights Retrenchment

⸻

INTRODUCTION

This exhibit describes how anomaly classification systems, as deployed by Palantir Technologies Inc. and affiliated contractors, function to covertly strip individuals of civil, political, and economic rights. While these rights remain intact on paper, anomaly status operates as a filter that denies access in practice. The effect is particularly acute for women and AFAB individuals, whose divergence from flawed digital twin baselines is more likely to be flagged as suspicious or noncompliant.

⸻

MECHANISM OF RIGHTS ROLLBACK
	1.	Forced Digital Reproduction
 Every individual is compelled into digital twin creation without consent or opt-out. These models are frequently inaccurate yet treated as authoritative benchmarks for personhood.
	2.	Triggering of Anomaly Status
 Any significant divergence from the digital twin — whether due to biological variation, caregiving responsibilities, or economic necessity — results in anomaly classification.
	3.	Practical Denial of Rights
 Once flagged as anomalous, individuals face cascading exclusion across domains:
 - Housing: rejection by landlords or credit scorers;
 - Employment: black-box suspicion scores used in hiring;
 - Credit: denial of loans or economic opportunity;
 - Voting: heightened barriers or quiet disenfranchisement.
	4.	No Opt-Out Pathway
 Individuals cannot decline twin creation or anomaly classification. The system operates as a mandatory condition of participation in civil society.

⸻

DISPARATE IMPACT ON WOMEN AND AFAB PEOPLE
	5.	Biological and Social Divergence
 Women and AFAB people are disproportionately flagged as anomalous because their lived realities diverge more sharply from standardized digital baselines. Examples include:
 - Hormonal and immunological variation misread as instability;
 - Pregnancy, caregiving, or non-linear work histories misread as noncompliance;
 - Consumer behaviors (e.g., clothing purchases, healthcare choices) misread as risk signals.
	6.	Backdoor Erasure of Rights
 Although women and AFAB individuals retain formal rights to housing, employment, credit, and political participation, anomaly classification covertly denies those rights. This functions as a sneaky rollback of decades of hard-won legal protections.

⸻

SYSTEMIC CONSEQUENCES
	7.	Functional Disenfranchisement
 Anomaly pipelines amount to civil death in practice, reducing individuals to non-person status without due process.
	8.	Erosion of Equal Protection
 By disproportionately targeting women and AFAB individuals, anomaly systems recreate systemic discrimination under the guise of neutral algorithmic governance.
	9.	Generational Harm
 The cumulative effect is intergenerational exclusion, where those tasked with reproductive continuity and caregiving are systematically erased from economic and political life.

⸻

CONCLUSION

Anomaly classification systems are not neutral tools of prediction; they are rights retrenchment machines. By forcing digital reproduction, punishing divergence, and disproportionately excluding women and AFAB individuals, they covertly undo progress in civil rights, reproductive autonomy, and equal protection.
