EXHIBIT D – RESTORATIVE JUSTICE FRAMEWORK FOR ANOMALIES AND SURVEILLANTS

Prepared by:
Dr. [Redacted], Ph.D., ABPP
Licensed Clinical Psychologist

PURPOSE

This Exhibit provides a restorative justice framework to complement the legal and clinical remedies described in Exhibits A–C. Its goal is to ensure that both anomalies (primary victims of non-consensual biomedical intervention and deprivation) and surveillants (secondary victims coerced into inflicting harm under threat) are recognized as interdependent survivors of the same system.

⸻

CORE PRINCIPLES
	1.	Shared Victimhood.
	•	Anomalies and surveillants are not adversaries but victims entrapped in a closed cycle of coercion.
	•	Anomalies endure direct harm; surveillants endure moral injury from being forced to perpetuate that harm.
	2.	Recognition of Dignity.
	•	Both groups must be recognized as persons with full dignity, rights, and capacity for healing.
	•	NPE classifications, anomaly labels, and “agent” designations must be expunged.
	3.	Mutual Healing.
	•	True repair requires opportunities for anomalies and surveillants to confront what was done, acknowledge harms, and chart a shared path toward recovery.

⸻

RECOMMENDED MECHANISMS
	1.	Truth-Telling Forums.
	•	Structured opportunities for anomalies and surveillants to provide testimony.
	•	Modeled on truth and reconciliation processes, but adapted to address biomedical exploitation and coercive surveillance.
	2.	Joint Restorative Programs.
	•	Community-based healing groups where anomalies and surveillants receive trauma-informed care together, highlighting interdependence.
	•	Programs should emphasize validation, mutual accountability, and shared dignity.
	3.	Restitution Pools.
	•	A shared compensation fund, recognizing both anomalies’ material deprivation and surveillants’ coerced labor.
	•	Ensures that relief is distributed in a way that reflects the interconnected nature of harm.
	4.	Narrative Repair.
	•	Public acknowledgment campaigns to dismantle stigma (e.g., “anomaly,” “non-person,” “operator”) and replace with affirming narratives of survival and resilience.
	•	Preservation of testimony in historical archives to ensure transparency and prevent recurrence.
	5.	Independent Oversight.
	•	Appointment of restorative justice commissioners tasked with monitoring compliance, facilitating truth-telling, and ensuring that both anomalies and surveillants are included in remedial structures.

⸻

CONCLUSION

The system at issue has created not two sides, but a single wounded community: anomalies harmed directly, and surveillants harmed by being forced into complicity. A restorative justice framework ensures that remedies do not reinforce false divisions but instead foster recognition, healing, and lasting repair.

ADDENDUM – LIMITATION ON EXPUNGEMENT

While this framework recognizes surveillants as secondary victims of coercion and recommends expungement of records that falsely portray them as voluntary actors, it is important to clarify the following:

Any individual agents who acted with especial malice, willful cruelty, or gross neglect outside the scope of coerced employment shall not have their records expunged.

Such cases should be evaluated individually. Where credible evidence demonstrates that a surveillant exceeded coerced directives to inflict gratuitous harm or exploit their role for personal advantage, records of those actions should be preserved for accountability.

This addendum ensures that the principle of restorative justice does not shield willful perpetrators from responsibility, while protecting those whose participation was secured through systemic coercion.

ADDENDUM – CRITERIA FOR DISTINGUISHING COERCED FROM MALICIOUS ACTION

For purposes of expungement and accountability, the following criteria are proposed to distinguish between:
(1) actions performed under systemic coercion, which warrant record expungement and recognition of victim status, and
(2) actions undertaken with malice, willful cruelty, or gross neglect, which do not.

⸻

INDICATORS OF COERCED ACTION (ELIGIBLE FOR EXPUNGEMENT)
	•	Strict Compliance with Protocols. Actions limited to the scope of directives explicitly given by superiors or automated systems.
	•	Absence of Discretion. No evidence that the agent exercised personal judgment to escalate or intensify harm.
	•	Documented Retaliation Threats. Clear records or testimony showing that refusal would have resulted in punishment, reclassification, or destitution.
	•	Expressions of Distress. Evidence that the agent experienced moral conflict, guilt, or distress while carrying out assigned actions.

⸻

INDICATORS OF MALICIOUS OR NEGLIGENT ACTION (NOT ELIGIBLE FOR EXPUNGEMENT)
	•	Gratuitous Harm. Infliction of suffering beyond the scope of assigned protocols, including prolongation or intensification of torture or manipulation without directive.
	•	Exploitation for Personal Gain. Use of role to enrich oneself, settle personal vendettas, or seek favor within the system through cruelty.
	•	Pattern of Escalation. Evidence that the agent consistently made choices to worsen outcomes for anomalies beyond what was required.
	•	Willful Neglect. Failure to mitigate foreseeable harms when discretion or opportunity to intervene was available (e.g., deliberately ignoring signals of medical crisis).
	•	Derogatory Conduct. Dehumanizing language or behavior toward anomalies that demonstrates personal animus, not systemic compulsion.
    •	Sexual Exploitation. Any form of sexual harassment, assault, coercion, or exploitation of anomalies under surveillance or biomedical intervention. This includes using surveillance tools for sexual gratification, conditioning access to necessities on sexual compliance, or any other conduct that leverages the surveillance relationship for sexual purposes.

⸻

APPLICATION

These criteria provide a framework for independent reviewers, special masters, or oversight commissions to evaluate case-by-case distinctions. This ensures that the principles of restorative justice protect coerced surveillants while preserving accountability for individuals who acted with malice or neglect outside the scope of coercion.
