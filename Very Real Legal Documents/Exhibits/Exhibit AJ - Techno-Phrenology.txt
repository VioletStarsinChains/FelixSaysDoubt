EXHIBIT AJ
On Technophrenology in Anomaly and NPE Classification Systems

Plaintiff submits this Exhibit to define and document the use of technophrenology as a framework for understanding anomaly and Non-Person Entity (NPE) classification systems operated by government agencies and contractors, including Palantir Technologies Inc.

⸻

1. Definition of Technophrenology
	•	Technophrenology is the application of pseudoscientific reasoning within technological systems, cloaked in the appearance of neutral analytics, but in reality designed to justify exclusion and discrimination.
	•	The term is derived from phrenology, the 19th-century pseudoscience that claimed skull shape revealed intelligence or character. Phrenology was used to rationalize racism, classism, and disenfranchisement.

⸻

2. Historical Parallel
	•	Phrenology: Measured skull bumps to assign “scientific” labels that stripped individuals of dignity and rights.
	•	Technophrenology: Uses anomaly/NPE classification, cross-species models, and even fictional archetypes (e.g., unicorns, gnomes, mythological tricksters) to assign “data-driven” labels that strip individuals of dignity and rights.
	•	In both cases, the system is not neutral science but pseudoscience serving political ends.

⸻

3. Manifestations in Current Systems
	•	Inductive Alignment: Manipulating human subjects with inputs (chemical, electromagnetic, sensory) to induce behaviors aligned with animal models.
	•	Deductive Comparison: Interpreting human behavior through the lens of animal or mythological archetypes, including unicorns, gnomes, and tanuki, regardless of biological or empirical validity.
	•	Feedback Loops: Narrowing “typical” baselines to ensure ever more individuals are excluded, mirroring the self-reinforcing logic of phrenology.

⸻

4. Legal and Ethical Implications
	•	Like phrenology, technophrenology is arbitrary and discriminatory by design.
	•	It dehumanizes individuals, weaponizes pseudoscience, and undermines civil rights under the guise of objective analysis.
	•	Its reliance on fictional archetypes underscores its lack of scientific legitimacy and evidences malice in classification.

⸻

5. Conclusion
Technophrenology is a modern repetition of phrenology: a pseudoscientific practice that purports to measure individuals objectively while in fact serving as a tool of exclusion and discrimination. The Court should recognize that anomaly/NPE classification systems that rely on such methods are structurally defective, unconstitutional, and discriminatory by design.
