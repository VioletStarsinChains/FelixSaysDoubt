EXHIBIT AC
CAPSULE HOTEL PROJECT OVERVIEW
Filed in Support of PLAINTIFF PRAYER FOR RELIEF: Remedies, Reparations, and Conditions of Alignment

⸻

PROJECT TITLE:

Inflammation-Aware Capsule Hotel (Pilot Unit)

⸻

I. MISSION

To create a low-cost, high-impact refuge for individuals in acute biological distress—especially those suffering from long-term inflammation, post-viral injury, sensory hypersensitivity, or nervous system dysregulation. This project functions both as a humanitarian intervention and as prototypical restitution infrastructure for harms caused by systemic medical, environmental, and surveillance-based neglect.

⸻

II. THE PROBLEM

Millions of individuals—many of whom have been misclassified, abandoned, or pathologized—live in a state of invisible inflammatory collapse. These conditions manifest behaviorally and perceptually, often leading to:
	•	Social rejection;
	•	Institutional mislabeling (e.g., “noncompliant,” “unstable”);
	•	And the total withdrawal of medical and housing support.

No recovery is possible without a regulated environment—yet such environments do not currently exist in any accessible public form.

⸻

III. THE CONCEPT

The Capsule Hotel prototype is a small-footprint, medically intentional micro-shelter designed to:
	•	Provide clean air, low-sensory, and electromagnetic-safe environments;
	•	Minimize inflammatory triggers (mold, synthetic fragrance, noise, EMF, fluorescent lighting);
	•	Offer short stays or emergency recovery support during flare-ups or post-exertional crashes;
	•	Serve as a pilot site for future inflammation-aware infrastructure.

This is not a hospital. It is a nervous system sanctuary.

⸻

IV. TARGET POPULATION

This pilot will serve:
	•	Long COVID survivors
	•	MCAS patients
	•	Autistic individuals with sensory needs
	•	Individuals exiting homelessness who cannot tolerate congregate shelters
	•	First responders, athletes, or trauma survivors experiencing acute crash cycles
	•	Anyone overwhelmed by a nervous system in collapse who cannot access regulated space

⸻

V. WHAT IS NEEDED

Plaintiff seeks restitution in the form of direct project support from Defendants, including:
	1.	A small, climate-controlled site with basic plumbing and electrical access;
	2.	A short-term lease or donation agreement for pilot development;
	3.	Institutional recognition of the project’s necessity as reparative infrastructure;
	4.	Freedom from zoning or enforcement actions that target biologically vulnerable individuals;
	5.	Public acknowledgment that this pilot may inform national recovery architecture for inflammation-related conditions.

⸻

This is not a luxury project.
It is a template for survival—designed for those who can no longer participate in the world as it is.
