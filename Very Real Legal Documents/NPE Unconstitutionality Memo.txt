MEMORANDUM OF LAW
RE: Unconstitutionality of “Non-Person Entity” (NPE) Classification as Applied to Housing Access

⸻

INTRODUCTION

This memorandum addresses whether the designation of certain individuals as “Non-Person Entities” (“NPEs”)—a classification that renders them legally incapable of contracting—comports with the United States Constitution. Because NPE status precludes individuals from entering into leases, mortgages, or utility agreements, it categorically blocks access to housing. As such, the system is unconstitutional on its face and as applied, violating fundamental rights under the Fifth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Amendments.

STATEMENT OF FACTS
	1.	Nature of NPE Classification. NPE status functions as an administrative designation that strips affected persons of legal capacity to contract.
	2.	Impact on Housing. Because housing in the United States universally requires contractual agreements—rental leases, purchase agreements, mortgage financing, or utility hookups—NPEs are categorically excluded from lawful access to shelter.
	3.	Collateral Exploitation. Despite being deprived of contractual capacity, NPEs are still subject to debts, surveillance, and obligations, creating a one-sided regime of exploitation without reciprocal rights.

LEGAL ISSUE

Whether classification as an NPE, which blocks an individual’s ability to contract for housing, violates the Constitution.

⸻

ARGUMENT

I. Substantive Due Process forbids arbitrary deprivation of life necessities.
The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit state action that arbitrarily denies individuals access to fundamental needs. Housing is indispensable for survival. Courts have long recognized that government classifications cannot operate to deprive individuals of the minimal conditions necessary for life. By design, NPE status forecloses every lawful avenue to housing, rendering survival contingent on state tolerance or private exploitation. Such deprivation is a direct violation of substantive due process.

II. Equal Protection forbids creation of a second-class caste.
NPE status creates a dual-track citizenship: one in which ordinary citizens may contract, and another in which NPEs are categorically excluded. The Supreme Court has repeatedly struck down laws that relegate individuals to permanent subordinate status (e.g., Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202 (1982), invalidating denial of education to undocumented children). Like Plyler, NPE classification inflicts systemic harm on a discrete class, ensuring intergenerational deprivation.

III. The Thirteenth Amendment prohibits structural servitude.
By depriving NPEs of housing capacity, the state forces them into dependence—living only under contracts held by others, or under state custody. This coerced reliance constitutes involuntary servitude, prohibited by the Thirteenth Amendment. The anti-peonage cases establish that individuals may not be structurally compelled into subordination by debt or classification; NPE status is precisely such a structure.

IV. The classification is unconstitutional on its face.
Unlike ordinary laws that may be applied unconstitutionally in certain instances, NPE status is unconstitutional in all its applications. By definition, it prevents contracting for housing, thereby guaranteeing deprivation of a fundamental necessity. Such a scheme cannot be reconciled with constitutional protections.

⸻

CONCLUSION

NPE classification, by rendering individuals incapable of contracting for housing, amounts to a categorical deprivation of a fundamental human necessity. It creates a civil caste system, strips affected individuals of due process, and enforces structural servitude. On its face and as applied, NPE status is unconstitutional.
