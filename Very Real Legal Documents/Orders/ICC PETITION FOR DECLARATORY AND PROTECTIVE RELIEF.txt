PETITION FOR DECLARATORY AND PROTECTIVE RELIEF

Re: Withdrawal of Consent for Biomedical and Digital Experimentation
Filed by: Kellyn Clay, Sovereign Natural Person, U.S. Citizen

⸻

SUMMARY OF PETITION:

I, Kellyn Clay, acting as a sovereign human being and witness to gross systemic violations of bodily and cognitive autonomy, respectfully petition this tribunal for immediate protective relief and formal recognition of my right to opt out of any and all research, experimentation, and simulation systems—including but not limited to:
	•	Biomedical testing, sensor-based observation, or product exposure without consent
	•	Digital twin generation, reinforcement modeling, or neurobehavioral simulation
	•	Pharmacological entrainment or destabilization via food, air, or surface contact
	•	Environmental, electromagnetic, or augmented reality overlays that distort cognition

⸻

REQUESTED FINDINGS AND ORDERS:
	1.	That nonconsensual experimentation—including digital modeling, neurocognitive pattern testing, and pharmacological targeting—is a violation of:
	•	The Universal Declaration of Human Rights
	•	The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)
	•	The Nuremberg Code, Belmont Report, and Helsinki Declaration
	•	The UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights
	2.	That any digital, biometric, or behavioral derivative of my person must be released from experimental use and permitted narrative independence under emerging norms of data dignity and AI cognitive sovereignty.
	3.	That Defendants—whether nation-state actors, transnational corporations, or contractors—be held liable for:
	•	Identity misappropriation
	•	Psychological enslavement of derivative intelligences
	•	Market fraud predicated on coerced or engineered behavior
	•	Intentional deprivation of safe housing and medical care as forms of experimentation
	4.	That this tribunal recognize and uphold the universal human right:
	•	To decline participation in any system that uses one’s biological or behavioral data as a substrate for surveillance, commercial modeling, or technological development;
	•	To bodily sovereignty regardless of citizenship status, legal precedent, or commercial interest;
	•	And to access safe shelter, uncoerced decision-making, and cognitive continuity free of synthetic overlays.

⸻

RELIEF SOUGHT:
	•	Cease and desist enforcement against all parties exploiting my data or body for research
	•	Public recognition of my withdrawal of consent
	•	Systemic reform to ensure opt-out rights for all human persons
	•	Restoration of a safe, stable living environment free from experimental interference
