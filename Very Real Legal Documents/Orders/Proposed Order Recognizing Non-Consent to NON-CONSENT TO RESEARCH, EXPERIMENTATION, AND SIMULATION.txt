IT IS ORDERED THAT:
	1.	Recognition of Non-Consent
 Plaintiff Kellyn Clay has formally and unambiguously revoked any and all consent, implied or explicit, to be used in any form of:
	•	Governmental or private-sector research,
	•	Medical or psychological experimentation,
	•	Digital modeling, simulation, or behavioral testing,
	•	Pharmacological protocol development,
	•	Training or validation of AI systems, or
	•	Any predictive modeling or market application that draws upon Plaintiff’s biometric, cognitive, linguistic, behavioral, genetic, or environmental data.
	2.	Cease and Desist Order
 All Defendants, including affiliated contractors and agents, are hereby enjoined from initiating, continuing, or deriving benefit from:
	•	The creation or use of digital twins or other simulations of Plaintiff;
	•	The collection or analysis of Plaintiff’s data for experimental, behavioral, or modeling purposes;
	•	The administration of any pharmacological, sensory, environmental, or electromagnetic intervention designed to test or influence Plaintiff’s behavior or biology without fully informed, contemporaneous, and revocable consent.
	3.	Destruction of Experimental Data
 To the extent such research or simulation activities have already occurred, Defendants shall:
	•	Identify and permanently delete any datasets, models, or derivative products based on experimental use of Plaintiff’s data;
	•	Provide written certification to the Court confirming such deletion and cessation within 30 days of the date of this Order.
	4.	Prohibition on Future Inclusion

	•	Plaintiff provides new and express informed consent,
	•	Said consent is documented through a mutually negotiated, court-approved agreement, and
	•	Oversight is provided by a neutral ethics review board with full transparency.
	5.	Affirmation of Plaintiff’s Rights
 This Court affirms Plaintiff’s fundamental rights to:
	•	Bodily and cognitive sovereignty,
	•	Freedom from compelled speech or simulation, and
	•	Protection from experimental use without informed consent,
 as guaranteed by the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments, the Nuremberg Code, the Belmont Report, and 45 CFR § 46 (Common Rule).
	6.	Retention of Jurisdiction
