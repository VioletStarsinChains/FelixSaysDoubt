[PROPOSED] ORDER

Compelling Disclosure of Internal Communications Regarding CEO Knowledge and Misrepresentation

Upon review of related filings, and for good cause shown, the Court finds that material discrepancies exist between the public statements of Palantir Technologies Inc.’s Chief Executive Officer, Alexander Karp, and the actual corporate practices of Palantir Technologies Inc.

The Court further finds that such discrepancies raise substantial questions as to whether:
	1.	Palantir’s CEO was deliberately shielded from knowledge of unlawful or unconstitutional surveillance practices;
	2.	The company knowingly misrepresented the scope and use of its technology to investors, government agencies, and the general public; and
	3.	The concealment of operational realities facilitated the continuation of attrition-based anomaly classification and behavioral futures profiteering.

Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:
	1.	Palantir Technologies Inc. shall, within ninety (90) days, produce to Plaintiff and to the Court all internal communications, memoranda, reports, and presentations from 2003 to present referencing:
	•	Deliberations or policies concerning what operational information was or was not disclosed to CEO Alexander Karp;
	•	Descriptions or summaries prepared specifically for CEO review regarding predictive policing, anomaly/NPE classification, ICE enforcement support, or behavioral futures applications;
	•	Instances where public statements by CEO Alexander Karp were knowingly inconsistent with actual deployments, as documented internally.
	2.	All such disclosures shall be delivered under seal, pending further judicial determination as to classification or privilege claims.
	3.	The Court retains jurisdiction to impose sanctions for failure to comply, up to and including default judgment on relevant counts.

SO ORDERED.
