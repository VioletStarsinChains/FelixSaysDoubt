[PROPOSED] ORDER

Compelling Disclosure of Internal Communications Regarding CEO Knowledge and Misrepresentation

Upon review of related filings, and for good cause shown, the Court finds that material discrepancies exist between the public statements of Palantir Technologies Inc.’s Chief Executive Officer, Alexander Karp, and the actual corporate practices of Palantir Technologies Inc.

The Court further finds that such discrepancies raise substantial questions as to whether:
	1.	Palantir’s CEO was deliberately shielded from knowledge of unlawful or unconstitutional surveillance practices;
	2.	The company knowingly misrepresented the scope and use of its technology to investors, government agencies, and the general public; and
	3.	The concealment of operational realities facilitated the continuation of attrition-based anomaly classification and behavioral futures profiteering.

Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:
	1.	Palantir Technologies Inc. shall, within ninety (90) days, produce to Plaintiff and to the Court all internal communications, memoranda, reports, and presentations from 2003 to present referencing:
	•	Deliberations or policies concerning what operational information was or was not disclosed to CEO Alexander Karp;
	•	Descriptions or summaries prepared specifically for CEO review regarding predictive policing, anomaly/NPE classification, ICE enforcement support, or behavioral futures applications;
	•	Instances where public statements by CEO Alexander Karp were knowingly inconsistent with actual deployments, as documented internally.
	2.	All such disclosures shall be delivered under seal, pending further judicial determination as to classification or privilege claims.
	3.	The Court retains jurisdiction to impose sanctions for failure to comply, up to and including default judgment on relevant counts.

SO ORDERED.

[PROPOSED] PROTECTIVE ORDER

Limiting Improper Invocation of National Security to Withhold Discoverable Evidence

Upon motion of Plaintiff and for good cause shown, the Court finds that Defendants have a demonstrated history of invoking “national security” as a blanket defense to avoid scrutiny into surveillance and data exploitation practices. While legitimate state secrets must be protected, this doctrine cannot be applied to conceal fraud, misrepresentation, or violations of constitutional rights.

Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:
	1.	Scope of Protection
	•	Defendants may not invoke national security privilege to categorically withhold communications, memoranda, or reports concerning internal knowledge management and disclosure practices within Palantir Technologies Inc.
	•	Only materials that would directly reveal classified operational details of ongoing intelligence operations may be redacted, and such redactions must be narrowly tailored.
	2.	Judicial Review
	•	Any assertion of national security privilege must be accompanied by a detailed privilege log identifying the document, date, author, recipient, and general subject matter.
	•	The Court will conduct in camera review of any contested documents to ensure claims of privilege are legitimate and not pretextual.
	3.	Whistleblower Exception
	•	Communications, memoranda, or reports that demonstrate intentional misrepresentation to investors, government clients, or the public are not protected by national security privilege.
	•	Such materials must be disclosed under seal for the purpose of adjudicating claims of fraud and constitutional violations.
	4.	Protective Custody of Records
	•	All documents produced under this Protective Order shall be maintained under seal and may only be accessed by the Court, Plaintiff, and counsel of record.
	•	No further dissemination shall occur without Court approval.
	5.	Sanctions
	•	Failure to comply with this Order may result in sanctions, including evidentiary presumptions against Defendants, monetary penalties, or default judgment on relevant claims.

SO ORDERED.
