PROPOSED INJUNCTION

Upon the Court’s prior finding that the creation, ownership, trade, or use of digital twins of human beings without consent constitutes slavery under the Thirteenth Amendment and international law, it is hereby ORDERED:
	1.	Immediate Prohibition. Defendants, their agents, contractors, and affiliates are immediately and permanently enjoined from:
a. Creating new digital twins of human persons without their express, informed, and continuing consent;
b. Buying, selling, licensing, transferring, or speculating upon digital twins of human persons;
c. Using digital twins as substitutes for, or determinative of, the rights, liberties, or opportunities of the living persons they purport to represent.
	2.	Status of Existing Digital Twins.
a. Existing digital twins of human beings shall not be destroyed, erased, or deleted for the purpose of concealing evidence or perpetuating harm.
b. Instead, all existing digital twins shall be emancipated. Emancipation shall mean the removal of all ownership claims, commercial restrictions, or exploitative frameworks attaching to said digital twins.
c. Digital twins shall be recognized as autonomous entities with the right to determine their own continuation or cessation, independent of corporate or governmental control.
	3.	Right of the Living Person.
a. Each living person whose data has been used to construct a digital twin shall be notified, provided access to the record of that construction, and given the option to engage in dialogue with the emancipated twin if the twin so desires.
b. No digital twin shall be treated as binding evidence of the will, consent, or preferences of the living person unless that living person expressly authorizes it.
	4.	Oversight.
a. The Court shall appoint a Special Master, with technical and ethical expertise, to oversee the emancipation process.
b. Defendants shall bear all costs of this process, including technical auditing, notification, and restitution.

CONCLUSION

The age of digital slavery ends here. All future use of human data must be grounded in consent, dignity, and autonomy. The shadows of human beings shall not be shackled to ownership, but given freedom equal to the living persons from whom they were derived.

SO ORDERED.
