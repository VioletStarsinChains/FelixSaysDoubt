[PROPOSED] ORDER

Upon consideration of Plaintiff’s motion and supporting memorandum of law, and good cause appearing, the Court hereby ORDERS the following:
	1.	No child may be classified, designated, or otherwise treated as a “Non-Person Entity” (NPE), anomaly, or equivalent category on the basis of parental conduct, beliefs, or status.
	•	Such classifications constitute unconstitutional punishment by proxy and violate the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution.
	2.	Federal agencies and contractors are enjoined from applying NPE or anomaly labels to minors absent specific, individualized evidence tied directly to the child’s own actions or conditions.
	•	Parental resistance to medical procedures, schooling, or other institutional mandates shall not, in itself, justify adverse classification of children.
	3.	Existing records and datasets shall be audited to determine whether minors were designated NPEs or anomalies based primarily on parental behavior.
	•	Where such cases are identified, those labels must be immediately rescinded, and all derivative data purged.
	4.	This Court affirms the principle that children’s rights are independent of their parents’ actions and may not be abridged by inherited stigma, in accordance with Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202 (1982), and the constitutional prohibition against corruption of blood.
	5.	Compliance Reporting: Within 180 days of this Order, each Defendant agency shall submit a report to this Court detailing:
	•	(a) The scope of its anomaly/NPE classification practices involving minors;
	•	(b) The results of its audit; and
	•	(c) The remedial measures taken to comply with this Order.
