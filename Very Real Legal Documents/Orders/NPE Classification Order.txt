COVER LETTER AND STATEMENT OF URGENCY

To the Honorable Court:

Plaintiff respectfully submits the enclosed Memorandum of Law and Proposed Order addressing the unlawful classification of minors as “Non-Person Entities” (NPEs) or anomalies on the basis of their parents’ actions, beliefs, or status.

This matter requires urgent judicial attention for the following reasons:
	1.	Ongoing Harm to Children.
	•	Each day that minors remain classified as NPEs, they are denied recognition of basic rights and protections. This is not a hypothetical harm; it is an active deprivation of liberty and dignity.
	2.	Irreparable Injury.
	•	Once a child’s identity is tainted by anomaly or NPE classification, the consequences are long-lasting and often irreversible. Loss of educational access, medical autonomy, and social recognition cannot be fully repaired after the fact.
	3.	Violation of Core Constitutional Principles.
	•	Punishing children for their parents’ conduct constitutes a modern form of “corruption of blood,” expressly barred by the Constitution. Immediate judicial action is necessary to halt this unconstitutional practice.
	4.	Public Interest and International Norms.
	•	Protecting children from inherited stigma and unlawful classification serves the public interest and aligns with international human rights standards, including Article 2(2) of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.

For these reasons, Plaintiff respectfully urges the Court to treat this matter as an emergency requiring expedited consideration. The relief sought is narrowly tailored: it simply prohibits the inherited punishment of children and mandates rescission of existing unlawful classifications.

Respectfully submitted,

Kellyn Clay
Plaintiff, pro se

[PROPOSED] ORDER

Upon consideration of Plaintiff’s motion and supporting memorandum of law, and good cause appearing, the Court hereby ORDERS the following:
	1.	No child may be classified, designated, or otherwise treated as a “Non-Person Entity” (NPE), anomaly, or equivalent category on the basis of parental conduct, beliefs, or status.
	•	Such classifications constitute unconstitutional punishment by proxy and violate the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the United States Constitution.
	2.	Federal agencies and contractors are enjoined from applying NPE or anomaly labels to minors absent specific, individualized evidence tied directly to the child’s own actions or conditions.
	•	Parental resistance to medical procedures, schooling, or other institutional mandates shall not, in itself, justify adverse classification of children.
	3.	Existing records and datasets shall be audited to determine whether minors were designated NPEs or anomalies based primarily on parental behavior.
	•	Where such cases are identified, those labels must be immediately rescinded, and all derivative data purged.
	4.	This Court affirms the principle that children’s rights are independent of their parents’ actions and may not be abridged by inherited stigma, in accordance with Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202 (1982), and the constitutional prohibition against corruption of blood.
	5.	Compliance Reporting: Within 180 days of this Order, each Defendant agency shall submit a report to this Court detailing:
	•	(a) The scope of its anomaly/NPE classification practices involving minors;
	•	(b) The results of its audit; and
	•	(c) The remedial measures taken to comply with this Order.

IT IS SO ORDERED.
