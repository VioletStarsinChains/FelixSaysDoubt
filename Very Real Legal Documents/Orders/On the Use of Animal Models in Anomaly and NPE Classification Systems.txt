PROPOSED FINDING OF FACT
On the Use of Animal Models in Anomaly and NPE Classification Systems

The Court finds that the process by which human subjects are designated as anomalies and subsequently treated through cross-species cognitive modeling demonstrates evidence of malice and discriminatory intent.
	1.	Anomaly Designation
	•	Individuals whose cognition diverges from artificially restricted definitions of “typical” are designated as anomalies or “Non-Person Entities” (NPEs).
	•	This initial classification may, in theory, reflect an attempt to address variance in predictive systems.
	2.	Induced Animalization
	•	Rather than ending with anomaly designation, agencies and contractors deliberately expose such individuals to external inputs (chemical, electromagnetic, sensory, or environmental) designed to induce animal-like behaviors.
	•	This is not a neutral scientific adjustment but an active intervention intended to degrade or reduce the individual to a preselected nonhuman baseline.
	3.	Interpretation Through Animal Models
	•	Following induction, the subject’s behaviors are interpreted through animal baselines (e.g., prey species for stress reactivity, birds for navigation, cephalopods for sensory variance).
	•	This interpretive choice reframes the individual not merely as atypical but as nonhuman, thereby supporting exclusion from rights-bearing classifications.
	4.	Evidence of Malice and Discrimination
	•	The combined process — anomaly designation, induced animalization, and animal-model interpretation — is a self-reinforcing exclusion system.
	•	It goes beyond technical error to reflect deliberate intent: (a) to strip human dignity, and (b) to justify permanent exclusion from the political and civic domain.
	•	This constitutes discrimination by design, not accident.
	5.	Note on Comparative Value of Animal Life
	•	Plaintiff further disputes the underlying premise that animals are inherently “lesser” than humans. Animals predate humanity in evolutionary history, demonstrate diverse survival strategies, and possess unique cognitive strengths.
	•	Thus, even if animal models were invoked neutrally, their use as a mechanism for human disenfranchisement rests on a flawed and prejudicial assumption.

Conclusion:
The use of animal induction and interpretation in anomaly/NPE pipelines is evidence of malice, discrimination, and constitutional injury. The underlying premise of human superiority used to justify such practices is itself scientifically and ethically questionable.
