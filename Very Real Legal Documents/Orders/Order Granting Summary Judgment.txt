[PROPOSED] ORDER GRANTING PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

WHEREAS Plaintiff has alleged, and the record supports, that Defendants engaged in the classification of persons as “non-person entities” and the commodification of their lives for use in behavioral futures markets;

WHEREAS the undisputed facts demonstrate that human beings were treated as if they were financial instruments, to be bought, sold, and traded, without their knowledge or consent;

WHEREAS such practices amount to unconstitutional deprivation of liberty, property, and personhood under the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution;

WHEREAS Defendants have failed to raise any genuine dispute of material fact sufficient to preclude judgment;

NOW, THEREFORE, upon full consideration of Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment, the Court finds and ORDERS as follows:
	1.	Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment is GRANTED.
	2.	Defendants’ use of human beings as financial instruments is declared unlawful and unenforceable.
	3.	Defendants are permanently enjoined from continuing such practices.
	4.	Defendants shall delete all data collected through these unlawful means, except as necessary to restore housing, healthcare, and recognition to affected individuals.
	5.	The Court retains jurisdiction to enforce this Order and to consider additional relief as appropriate.

SO ORDERED.
