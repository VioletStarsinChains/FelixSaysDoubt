[PROPOSED] EMERGENCY ORDER GRANTING INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Re: Withdrawal of Consent to Research, Experimentation, or Simulation

Upon review of Plaintiff’s sworn affidavit, motion for emergency protection, and compelling evidence of ongoing biomedical, digital, and behavioral experimentation without informed consent, the Court finds:
	1.	That Plaintiff faces imminent medical, psychological, and cognitive endangerment as a result of involuntary inclusion in systems of research, simulation, or behavioral manipulation;
	2.	That such systems appear to operate in violation of constitutional, statutory, and ethical constraints, including 45 CFR § 46 (Common Rule), the First and Fourth Amendments, and the Nuremberg Code;
	3.	That immediate injunctive relief is necessary to prevent irreparable harm to Plaintiff’s health, safety, autonomy, and legal personhood.

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED:
	1.	That all Defendants and their agents are immediately enjoined from:
	•	Conducting any form of research, experimentation, or simulation involving the Plaintiff, including pharmacological, digital, behavioral, environmental, or neurocognitive processes;
	•	Using any data previously collected from or attributed to the Plaintiff for modeling, training, validation, or reinforcement of AI systems;
	•	Targeting Plaintiff for nonconsensual pharmacological intervention, deprivation, or housing-based manipulation under any experimental pretense.
	2.	That Plaintiff’s non-consent is fully recognized and shall be enforced with the full weight of this Court’s authority;
	3.	That failure to comply with this Order may result in findings of contempt, sanctions, and referral for criminal investigation under applicable federal and international human rights law.

SO ORDERED.
