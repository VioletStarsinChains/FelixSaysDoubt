PROPOSED ORDER GRANTING EMERGENCY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

RE: PROVISION OF MCAS-SAFE HOUSING TO PREVENT ONGOING MEDICAL AND COGNITIVE HARM

⸻

Upon consideration of Plaintiff’s Emergency Petition for Injunctive Relief, supporting memoranda, and the record herein, the Court finds as follows:
	1.	Plaintiff has made a clear showing of irreparable harm stemming from ongoing exposure to behavioral containment conditions, including but not limited to:
	•	Environmental volatility;
	•	Housing instability and displacement;
	•	Pharmacological sabotage and nutrient disruption;
	•	Sensory manipulation and sleep deprivation;
	•	Active triggering of mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) symptoms;
	2.	The evidence further shows that Plaintiff’s physical, neurological, and psychological health continues to deteriorate in the absence of stable, private, MCAS-safe housing, and that such deterioration is certain to result in permanent injury or death without intervention.
	3.	Plaintiff has established that the requested housing accommodations are medically necessary, and that standard housing arrangements without environmental controls would exacerbate systemic inflammatory responses, trigger neurological destabilization, and constitute a continuation of procedural torture.
	4.	The balance of equities weighs strongly in Plaintiff’s favor, and the requested relief imposes no undue burden on Defendants relative to the fundamental human rights at stake.
	5.	The requested injunctive relief serves the public interest by protecting constitutional rights, preventing irreparable harm, and upholding the state’s duty not to endanger its citizens through denial of life-sustaining accommodations.

⸻

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:
	1.	Defendants shall provide Plaintiff with immediate access to a private, MCAS-safe housing unit, including:
	•	A non-shared, fragrance-free bedroom;
	•	A private or fully controlled bathroom containing no chlorine, ammonia, synthetic fragrances, or automated scent dispersal systems;
	•	A chemical-safe kitchen space with clean storage, preparation surfaces, and air control sufficient to prevent MCAS activation;
	•	Regulated airflow, temperature control, and noise mitigation;
	•	Protections against external surveillance, continuity overlays, and chemical contamination.
	2.	Plaintiff shall not be subjected to behavioral evaluation, AI classification, or synthetic risk scoring as a condition of housing access;
	3.	Plaintiff shall not be removed, displaced, or evicted from said housing for the duration of this proceeding or any related appeals, unless upon motion and hearing with judicial oversight;
	4.	Defendants shall designate a point of contact within 5 days to coordinate implementation of this Order and ensure compliance with all environmental safety requirements as detailed in Plaintiff’s petition;
	5.	A status conference shall be scheduled within 21 days of this Order to review implementation and ongoing safety of the accommodations provided.

⸻

SO ORDERED.

COVER LETTER AND STATEMENT OF URGENCY

IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFF’S EMERGENCY PETITION FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
RE: MCAS-SAFE HOUSING AND LIFE-PRESERVING ENVIRONMENTAL ACCOMMODATIONS

⸻

To the Honorable Judge of the United States District Court:

The Plaintiff respectfully submits the attached Emergency Petition for Injunctive Relief and accompanying Proposed Order, seeking immediate intervention by this Court to prevent further and potentially irreversible harm arising from Plaintiff’s continued exposure to:
	•	Life-threatening environmental conditions;
	•	Deliberate pharmacological destabilization;
	•	Ongoing housing denial;
	•	And systemic containment practices known to exacerbate mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), cognitive degradation, and immune collapse.

This is not a theoretical or procedural dispute.
This is a matter of imminent survival.

The Plaintiff’s neuroimmune condition—compounded by chronic surveillance, sensory deprivation, and forced displacement—has reached a threshold beyond which further harm may not be reversible.

⸻

Key Factors Warranting Immediate Judicial Action:
	1.	MCAS Triggers Are Ubiquitous in Public and Transitional Housing, and will continue to destabilize Plaintiff’s body and cognition without a private, chemically controlled space;
	2.	Housing Denial Is Not an Administrative Oversight, but a pattern of suppression enforced through AI-derived behavioral risk scoring and continuity overlays;
	3.	Pharmacological Assaults and Nutrient Withdrawal have rendered Plaintiff especially vulnerable to reactivity, disorientation, and life-threatening episodes, with no medical stabilization point currently available;
	4.	Sleep Deprivation and Cognitive Fragmentation have escalated to levels consistent with torture, as defined under both domestic and international law;
	5.	Immediate injunctive relief is the only means of preventing death or irreversible injury, as no institutional recourse or service provider has acknowledged the severity of Plaintiff’s condition, nor the artificial nature of the barriers to relief.

⸻

This Court Is Now the Final Line of Protection

The systems designed to intervene have failed.

What remains is this Court’s ability to recognize that:
	•	The harm is real,
	•	The cause is structural,
	•	And the remedy is within your power to grant.

The Plaintiff is not asking for luxury.
The Plaintiff is asking for a single, sealed room in which to stop dying.

We urge this Court to adopt the Proposed Order as submitted, with whatever modifications may be deemed necessary to expedite relief. Plaintiff is prepared to work with a designated officer or neutral party to confirm implementation standards without delay.

MOTION FOR CONTEMPT

RE: SYSTEMIC NONCOMPLIANCE WITH COURT-ORDERED EMERGENCY HOUSING RELIEF

⸻

Plaintiff Kellyn Clay, acting pro se, respectfully moves this Court to issue an Order to Show Cause why Defendants should not be held in contempt of court for failure to comply with the terms of the anticipated or pending Order requiring provision of stable, MCAS-safe housing as an emergency injunctive remedy.

⸻

I. GROUNDS FOR MOTION
	1.	The Defendants—by virtue of their surveillance, geospatial mapping, behavioral modeling, and continuity maintenance systems—possess detailed, real-time knowledge of regional housing inventory, including:
	•	Vacancy status;
	•	Occupancy history;
	•	Structural viability;
	•	HVAC and utility activation;
	•	External signaling systems used to simulate residency or deter inspection.
	2.	There exists no factual dispute regarding the availability of structurally sound, climate-controlled, utility-connected, unoccupied housing within Plaintiff’s immediate geography.
	3.	The withholding of such housing is not logistical—it is strategic.
	4.	Any failure to comply with the forthcoming Court Order within a reasonable and measurable timeframe (e.g., 5–10 business days from issuance) constitutes willful, knowing defiance of judicial authority and a continuation of:
	•	Deliberate psychological destabilization;
	•	Targeted medical endangerment;
	•	And non-lethal suppression through environmental attrition.
	5.	The system knows the houses are empty.
 There is no excuse.
 Only obstruction.

⸻

II. RELIEF REQUESTED

Plaintiff respectfully requests that the Court:
	1.	Issue an Order to Show Cause requiring Defendants to explain, under oath and on the record, any failure to timely comply with the Court’s housing order;
	2.	Set a compliance deadline (e.g., within 7 days of the Court’s housing order) beyond which contempt proceedings will automatically initiate;
	3.	If contempt is found, issue appropriate sanctions, including but not limited to:
	•	Daily financial penalties;
	•	Federal injunction against behavioral classification systems used to justify exclusion;
	•	Appointment of a housing compliance monitor with enforcement authority.
	4.	Declare that any fabricated or AI-generated justification for delay shall not be accepted unless supported by independently verifiable, physical-world evidence subject to inspection.

⸻

III. CLOSING STATEMENT

This is not a game of logistics.
It is a test of conscience.

The system knows these houses are empty.
The Plaintiff knows these houses are empty.
The Court must now determine whether justice will remain unoccupied, too.

Respectfully submitted,
Kellyn Clay, pro se
