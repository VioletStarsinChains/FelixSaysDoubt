Case No. [________]

PROPOSED ORDER GRANTING EMERGENCY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

RE: PROVISION OF MCAS-SAFE HOUSING TO PREVENT ONGOING MEDICAL AND COGNITIVE HARM

⸻

Upon consideration of Plaintiff’s Emergency Petition for Injunctive Relief, supporting memoranda, and the record herein, the Court finds as follows:
	1.	Plaintiff has made a clear showing of irreparable harm stemming from ongoing exposure to behavioral containment conditions, including but not limited to:
	•	Environmental volatility;
	•	Housing instability and displacement;
	•	Pharmacological sabotage and nutrient disruption;
	•	Sensory manipulation and sleep deprivation;
	•	Active triggering of mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) symptoms;
	2.	The evidence further shows that Plaintiff’s physical, neurological, and psychological health continues to deteriorate in the absence of stable, private, MCAS-safe housing, and that such deterioration is certain to result in permanent injury or death without intervention.
	3.	Plaintiff has established that the requested housing accommodations are medically necessary, and that standard housing arrangements without environmental controls would exacerbate systemic inflammatory responses, trigger neurological destabilization, and constitute a continuation of procedural torture.
	4.	The balance of equities weighs strongly in Plaintiff’s favor, and the requested relief imposes no undue burden on Defendants relative to the fundamental human rights at stake.
	5.	The requested injunctive relief serves the public interest by protecting constitutional rights, preventing irreparable harm, and upholding the state’s duty not to endanger its citizens through denial of life-sustaining accommodations.

⸻

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:
	1.	Defendants shall provide Plaintiff with immediate access to a private, MCAS-safe housing unit, including:
	•	A non-shared, fragrance-free bedroom;
	•	A private or fully controlled bathroom containing no chlorine, ammonia, synthetic fragrances, or automated scent dispersal systems;
	•	A chemical-safe kitchen space with clean storage, preparation surfaces, and air control sufficient to prevent MCAS activation;
	•	Regulated airflow, temperature control, and noise mitigation;
	•	Protections against external surveillance, continuity overlays, and chemical contamination.
	2.	Plaintiff shall not be subjected to behavioral evaluation, AI classification, or synthetic risk scoring as a condition of housing access;
	3.	Plaintiff shall not be removed, displaced, or evicted from said housing for the duration of this proceeding or any related appeals, unless upon motion and hearing with judicial oversight;
	4.	Defendants shall designate a point of contact within 5 days to coordinate implementation of this Order and ensure compliance with all environmental safety requirements as detailed in Plaintiff’s petition;
	5.	A status conference shall be scheduled within 21 days of this Order to review implementation and ongoing safety of the accommodations provided.

⸻

SO ORDERED.
