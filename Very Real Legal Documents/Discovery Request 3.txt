	1.	All dental X-rays (bitewing, periapical, panoramic, and cephalometric images) taken during Plaintiff’s care, in their original digital format (DICOM or JPEG).
	2.	Any cone beam CT scans (CBCT) performed, including raw DICOM files and any associated 3D reconstructions.
	3.	Technologist and dental assistant logs documenting image acquisition, including machine settings, date/time, and any notes regarding unusual findings.
	4.	Radiology or dental reports interpreting the images, including preliminary or draft notes not transmitted to Plaintiff.
	5.	Internal communications among Metro Dentalcare staff, or between Metro Dentalcare and external consultants, concerning interpretation of Plaintiff’s imaging results.
	6.	All versions of treatment plans that reference imaging findings, including notes regarding “non-dental” anomalies observed.

Request No. 7 – Data Sharing
Produce all records reflecting whether Plaintiff’s dental X-rays or cone beam CT scans were shared with third-party providers, insurance companies, or research databases.

PURPOSE

These requests are intended to ensure Plaintiff has access to the full imaging record necessary to independently evaluate the presence of potential anomalies or covert implants, and to determine whether Metro Dentalcare withheld, altered, or transmitted such data without Plaintiff’s knowledge or consent.

Respectfully submitted,
Bango Skank, JD
