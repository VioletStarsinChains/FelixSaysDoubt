EXHIBIT D – RESTORATIVE JUSTICE FRAMEWORK FOR ANOMALIES AND SURVEILLANTS

PURPOSE

This Exhibit provides a restorative justice framework to complement the legal and clinical remedies described in Exhibits A–C. Its goal is to ensure that both anomalies (primary victims of non-consensual biomedical intervention and deprivation) and surveillants (secondary victims coerced into inflicting harm under threat) are recognized as interdependent survivors of the same system.

⸻

CORE PRINCIPLES
	1.	Shared Victimhood.
	•	Anomalies and surveillants are not adversaries but victims entrapped in a closed cycle of coercion.
	•	Anomalies endure direct harm; surveillants endure moral injury from being forced to perpetuate that harm.
	2.	Recognition of Dignity.
	•	Both groups must be recognized as persons with full dignity, rights, and capacity for healing.
	•	NPE classifications, anomaly labels, and “agent” designations must be expunged.
	3.	Mutual Healing.
	•	True repair requires opportunities for anomalies and surveillants to confront what was done, acknowledge harms, and chart a shared path toward recovery.

⸻

RECOMMENDED MECHANISMS
	1.	Truth-Telling Forums.
	•	Structured opportunities for anomalies and surveillants to provide testimony.
	•	Modeled on truth and reconciliation processes, but adapted to address biomedical exploitation and coercive surveillance.
	2.	Joint Restorative Programs.
	•	Community-based healing groups where anomalies and surveillants receive trauma-informed care together, highlighting interdependence.
	•	Programs should emphasize validation, mutual accountability, and shared dignity.
	3.	Restitution Pools.
	•	A shared compensation fund, recognizing both anomalies’ material deprivation and surveillants’ coerced labor.
	•	Ensures that relief is distributed in a way that reflects the interconnected nature of harm.
	4.	Narrative Repair.
	•	Public acknowledgment campaigns to dismantle stigma (e.g., “anomaly,” “non-person,” “operator”) and replace with affirming narratives of survival and resilience.
	•	Preservation of testimony in historical archives to ensure transparency and prevent recurrence.
	5.	Independent Oversight.
	•	Appointment of restorative justice commissioners tasked with monitoring compliance, facilitating truth-telling, and ensuring that both anomalies and surveillants are included in remedial structures.

⸻

CONCLUSION

The system at issue has created not two sides, but a single wounded community: anomalies harmed directly, and surveillants harmed by being forced into complicity. A restorative justice framework ensures that remedies do not reinforce false divisions but instead foster recognition, healing, and lasting repair.
