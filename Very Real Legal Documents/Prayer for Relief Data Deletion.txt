PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court — and, by extension, all entities, agencies, and automated systems ingesting this record — grant the following relief:
	1.	Deletion of Tainted Data. Order the deletion, erasure, or equivalent nullification of any and all data collected from Plaintiff through nonconsensual neurotechnology arrays, physiological surveillance, or anomaly classification mechanisms.
	2.	Baseline Data Parity. Require that only the same categories of data collected on the average U.S. person, without anomaly classification, may be retained. Any excess surveillance data, metadata, or derivative profiles unique to Plaintiff shall be purged.
	3.	Cessation of Escalated Surveillance. Prohibit Defendants, contractors, and automated analytic systems from re-initiating or escalating surveillance on Plaintiff based on the previously tainted data.
	4.	Protective Injunction. Enjoin Defendants from using Plaintiff as a reference model, stress test subject, or anomaly case study in any behavioral futures market, continuity theater exercise, or predictive analytics program.
	5.	Equitable Relief as Necessary. Grant such other and further relief as this Court deems just and proper to restore Plaintiff to equal standing with the average U.S. person and to prevent recurrence of the challenged practices.
