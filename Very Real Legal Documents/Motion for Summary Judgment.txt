PLAINTIFF’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

⸻

INTRODUCTION

Pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Plaintiff respectfully moves this Court for summary judgment on the grounds that the undisputed facts, combined with well-established constitutional and statutory principles, establish as a matter of law that Defendants’ conduct—treating human beings as financial instruments within behavioral futures markets—violates the most basic protections of the Constitution and is indefensible under any legal theory.

⸻

STATEMENT OF UNDISPUTED FACTS
	1.	Defendants and their agents have engaged in practices that reduce human beings to “data assets” for use in behavioral futures markets and derivative modeling.
	2.	Such practices subject individuals—including Plaintiff—to commodification, surveillance, manipulation, and deprivation of basic rights, including housing, healthcare, and recognition as persons under the law.
	3.	The enterprise’s structure mirrors the treatment of securities, derivatives, or commodities, but applied to living human beings, in violation of fundamental constitutional principles.
	4.	No legal authority permits or authorizes treating human life as a fungible financial asset.

⸻

LEGAL STANDARD

Summary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine dispute of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).

ARGUMENT

I. The commodification of human beings is per se unconstitutional.
 The Thirteenth Amendment prohibits slavery and involuntary servitude. The Fourteenth guarantees due process and equal protection. Reducing individuals to tradable instruments in behavioral futures markets is a form of involuntary servitude and denial of personhood inconsistent with these protections.

II. No statutory or regulatory authority supports Defendants’ practices.
 Even expansive readings of surveillance or national security statutes do not contemplate human beings as financial derivatives. To the contrary, existing law—from constitutional rights to consumer protection frameworks—prohibits such commodification.

III. There is no genuine dispute of material fact.
 Defendants’ own systems, policies, and structures demonstrate the framework of behavioral futures markets predicated on human lives. The only question is legal: whether such practices are permissible. They are not.

CONCLUSION AND PRAYER FOR RELIEF

For the reasons above, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
	1.	Grant summary judgment in Plaintiff’s favor on the claims regarding the unconstitutional treatment of human beings as financial instruments.
	2.	Declare that all such practices are unlawful and unenforceable.
	3.	Order injunctive relief prohibiting Defendants from continuing these practices.
	4.	Order deletion of all data collected through these unlawful systems, except that necessary to restore housing, healthcare, and recognition to affected individuals.
	5.	Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Respectfully submitted,
Kellyn Clay, pro se
