MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT

Plaintiff respectfully moves this Court for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. No genuine dispute of material fact exists, and judgment as a matter of law is compelled.

⸻

INTRODUCTION

Plaintiff has presented overwhelming evidence of non-consensual biomedical intervention, unlawful surveillance, and systemic deprivation. The record demonstrates not only constitutional violations but also logical impossibilities that make Defendants’ positions incoherent and unenforceable.

At the core of this Motion is Exhibit L: Statement of Paradoxes, which catalogues fifteen contradictions at the heart of Defendants’ treatment of Plaintiff. These paradoxes are not semantic quibbles; they prove that the system cannot simultaneously enforce obligations, deny rights, and obscure life status without collapsing into fraud and unconstitutionality.

LEGAL STANDARD

Summary judgment is appropriate when “there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). When Defendants’ entire framework is shown to be self-contradictory, no material fact remains to sustain their defense.

ARGUMENT

I. Defendants’ positions collapse under their own contradictions.

As shown in Exhibit L, Plaintiff is treated as simultaneously:
	•	a legal person and a non-person;
	•	alive and dead;
	•	bound by contracts and incapable of contracting;
	•	surveilled based on tainted data and silenced when challenging it.

These paradoxes are not isolated errors but structural contradictions that make Defendants’ actions arbitrary, capricious, and unconstitutional under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. A government cannot compel obligations from an individual while denying the recognition necessary to fulfill them.

II. Fraudulent acknowledgment and fraudulent denial demonstrate bad faith.

Defendants and their contractors selectively recognize Plaintiff’s personhood when issuing diplomas, accounts, or debts, while denying the same status to justify surveillance and deprivation of housing. Such contradictory postures constitute fraud, misrepresentation, and deprivation of rights under color of law.

III. Use of “fruit of the poisonous tree” data invalidates all surveillance justifications.

All neurotechnology-derived data gathered from Plaintiff was obtained without consent and in violation of constitutional protections. This data cannot lawfully justify continued or escalated surveillance. As Exhibit L demonstrates, to argue otherwise forces Defendants into further paradox: claiming both that the data is essential and that it is legally permissible, when in fact it is neither.

IV. A system that cannot distinguish between life and death cannot claim constitutional legitimacy.

Defendants obscure whether Plaintiff’s data is generated by a living individual or the continued operation of a digital twin. This deliberate ambiguity makes it impossible for rights to be adjudicated properly. Constitutional rights do not vanish upon ambiguity, nor can Defendants shelter behind uncertainty they themselves manufacture.

V. Relief is compelled as a matter of law.

Given these contradictions, no material facts remain for trial. A legal framework built on paradox cannot be sustained. Summary judgment is the only remedy that upholds constitutional order.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
	1.	Grant summary judgment in Plaintiff’s favor;
	2.	Declare unconstitutional the classification of Plaintiff and others as “non-person entities”;
	3.	Enjoin Defendants from further use of data derived from non-consensual neurotechnology arrays;
	4.	Order deletion of all data collected from Plaintiff beyond that which is collected on ordinary citizens;
	5.	Recognize housing deprivation based on NPE status or fraudulent debts as unlawful;
	6.	Award damages consistent with Exhibits J and K, and restitution of assets wrongfully diverted;
	7.	Certify the class as outlined in prior memoranda, ensuring relief applies to all similarly situated individuals; and
	8.	Grant any further relief the Court deems just and proper.
