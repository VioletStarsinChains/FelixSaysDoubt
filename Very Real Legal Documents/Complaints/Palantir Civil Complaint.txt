CIVIL COMPLAINT FOR FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION, UNJUST ENRICHMENT, CIVIL CONSPIRACY, DUE-PROCESS DEPRIVATION, AND FUNCTIONAL REDLINING

(Re: False “Terrorism Prevention” Claims, Distorted Classification Pipelines, Housing/Data Continuity Filters, and Concealed Executive Digital-Twin Governance)

⸻

INTRODUCTION

Plaintiff Kellyn Clay brings this action against Palantir Technologies Inc. and its federal partners for knowingly misrepresenting the function and effectiveness of their surveillance/analytics platforms, including claims to “prevent terrorism,” while deploying classification systems that strip context, amplify distortion, and falsely label civilians as anomalies, including “Non-Person Entities” (“NPEs”). These labels—derived from externally manipulated, contaminated data—have been used to deprive individuals of due process and access to federal benefits, including Social Security, creating a system of economic confiscation under color of counterterrorism.

Concurrently, Defendants facilitated functional redlining by constraining Plaintiff’s housing access through vendor continuity filters (e.g., a single national trash hauler across multiple residences in different states), centralizing surveillance and “entrainment residue” collection while giving the appearance of ordinary utility contracting. The resulting harms include mass surveillance without lawful justification, deprivation of rights and benefits, and unjust enrichment through federal contracts obtained by false claims.

Further, Palantir’s corporate governance and investor communications were materially tied to the persona and decision-making authority of CEO Alexander C. Karp. To the extent Palantir created, maintained, or operationalized digital twins of executive leadership (including Karp) and used those twins to simulate, influence, or substitute for human decision-making—without disclosure—Palantir committed fraud by omission. That concealment is material to investor confidence, stock valuation, contracting partners’ reliance, and to Plaintiff’s harms where tainted governance enabled and concealed the misconduct alleged herein.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE
	1.	Jurisdiction is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question), 28 U.S.C. § 1343 (civil rights), and 28 U.S.C. § 1332 (diversity of citizenship).
	2.	Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because substantial parts of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in this District and throughout the United States, and Defendants transact business nationwide.

⸻

PARTIES
	3.	Plaintiff Kellyn Clay is a U.S. citizen residing within the jurisdiction of this Court.
	4.	Defendant Palantir Technologies Inc. is a private technology contractor headquartered in Denver, Colorado, that contracts extensively with U.S. agencies.
	5.	Defendant United States of America is sued through its agencies for oversight failure and participation in a civil conspiracy.
	6.	John Doe Contracting Agencies and Affiliates are yet-unidentified entities acting in concert with Palantir in the deployment, justification, and concealment of the systems described herein.

⸻

DEFINITIONS (FOR CLARITY OF PLEADING)
	7.	Silly String: Externally applied, sticky overlays (chemical/energetic/narrative) that temporarily alter affect/behavior and are often misclassified as permanent traits.
	8.	Confetti: Brief distraction bursts that fragment attention and pollute data streams with noise.
	9.	Distortion Quotient (“DQ”): A composite measure of the degree to which observed behavior is distorted by external manipulations, integrating (a) silly string overlays, (b) confetti distractions, and (c) system escalation (compounding effects from interventions based on already-distorted data).
 • Safeguard Rule: When DQ crosses a defined threshold (e.g., ≥ 0.70), any anomaly/NPE classification must be automatically suspended pending intensive human review with contextual restoration.
	10.	Functional Redlining: A continuity mechanism that restricts housing access via “neutral” vendor filters (e.g., a single national trash hauler across all residences), producing exclusionary effects analogous to redlining while consolidating surveillance and “waste-stream” data capture.

⸻

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
	11.	Palantir marketed itself as enabling agencies to “prevent terrorism,” “predict and stop threats,” and “protect national security,” including in public investor materials and procurement pitches.
	12.	Palantir had access to extensive behavioral, biometric, financial, and geospatial data yet failed to prevent the deadliest mass shootings and major domestic terror events in the U.S.
	13.	Palantir knew or should have known that its predictive models could not deliver the advertised “prevention” outcomes, yet continued to secure high-value federal contracts on that claim.
	14.	Rather than prevent violence, Defendants’ systems were used to:
 • Coerce behavior via nudging and opaque risk scoring;
 • Classify civilians as anomalies or “NPEs” without due process;
 • Deny procedural safeguards through automated suspicion pipelines.
	15.	Defendants structured pipelines that ignore context and record externally induced states as permanent traits—converting “silly string” and “confetti” into life-long labels.
	16.	Defendants were, or should have been, aware that such methods would generate widespread false anomaly/NPE labels from contaminated data.
	17.	The NPE labeling pipeline is economically confiscatory: individuals continue to pay mandatory Social Security contributions while being secretly engineered or funneled into categories that later deny benefits, effectively stripping earned entitlements.
	18.	Defendants also facilitated functional redlining: Plaintiff’s housing options repeatedly resolved to properties under the same national trash-hauler across multiple states, centralizing waste-stream data (including entrainment residues such as musks, menthols, aldehydes, and oak-derived compounds) and “confetti” bursts (novelty/insert chaff).
	19.	This vendor continuity created a covert longitudinal dataset and restricted housing mobility while presenting as ordinary utility contracting—a redlining analogue that consolidates surveillance and preserves distorted records.
	20.	Palantir profited massively from these practices while delivering systems that weaponized manipulated data against civilians and undermined due process, evidentiary reliability, and civil rights.
Executive Digital-Twin Governance (Additional Allegations)
20.a. Palantir’s brand, investor confidence, and stock valuation were materially tied to CEO Alexander C. Karp’s persona and purported direct human decision-making.
20.b. On information and belief, Palantir created, maintained, or operationalized digital twins of executive leadership and used such twins to simulate, influence, or substitute for human leadership in governance, contracting, and investor communications.
20.c. Palantir failed to disclose this material fact to investors, contracting partners, and the public, constituting fraud by omission.
20.d. The concealment of executive digital-twin governance enabled, normalized, and shielded the broader misconduct alleged here—including contaminated data pipelines, anomaly/NPE designations, and functional redlining—by insulating Palantir’s internal decision-making from accountability while trading on the “Karp brand.”
20.e. Plaintiff’s harms are traceable to this concealed governance structure, which materially affected corporate policies and practices that targeted and injured Plaintiff.

⸻

AFFIDAVIT-STYLE SAFEGUARD STATEMENT (INCORPORATED)
	21.	It is Plaintiff’s position that any anomaly designation arising from manipulated data must be automatically suspended when the Distortion Quotient (DQ) exceeds the defined threshold. DQ measures distortion from silly string (sticky overlays), confetti (fleeting distractions), and system escalation (compounding interventions). Natural environmental entrainment is not wrongful; the harm arises when synthetic manipulations are recorded without context and escalations amplify their effects. In such cases, the data no longer reflects a person’s true baseline state. Continuing to use that data for surveillance, intervention, or sentencing constitutes misclassification and risks condemning innocent individuals. Therefore, when DQ crosses threshold, anomaly status must be suspended by rule and intensive human review required before further action.

CAUSES OF ACTION

Count I – Fraudulent Misrepresentation
	22.	Palantir knowingly made false, material claims about preventing terrorism to induce reliance by agencies and the public.
	23.	Contracts and deployments were secured on the basis of these misrepresentations; Plaintiff and the public were harmed through surveillance expansion, coercive nudging, and distorted classifications.

Count II – Unjust Enrichment
	24.	Palantir received billions in federal funds tied to “prevention” deliverables it did not provide; retention of those funds is unjust where systems produced rights deprivations rather than safety.

Count III – Civil Conspiracy
	25.	Defendants acted in concert to construct and maintain a fraudulent “terrorism prevention” narrative that justified mass behavioral surveillance and context-stripped classifications, concealing the true uses and harms.

Count IV – Deprivation of Rights and Due Process (U.S. Const. amend. V)
	26.	By adopting and feeding context-free anomaly/NPE labels into decision systems that control access to liberty and benefits, Defendants deprived Plaintiff and similarly situated persons of procedural and substantive due process, including earned Social Security benefits, based on contaminated, manipulated data.

Count V – Fraud and False Claims in Government Contracting (Common-Law Fraud; Fraudulent Inducement)
	27.	Palantir’s procurement representations and deliverables materially departed from claimed prevention functions; knowing use of distorted data and foreseeable misclassification constitute fraud in inducement and performance of federal contracts.
	28.	To the extent individual executives were aware and failed to intervene, personal liability is warranted under theories of willful misconduct and reckless disregard. Palantir’s concealed use of executive digital-twin governance further tainted procurement reliance and masked material operational risks.

Count VI – Functional Redlining and Housing Restriction (Fair Housing Act principles)
	29.	Defendants’ vendor continuity filters (e.g., single national waste-hauler across residences) restricted Plaintiff’s housing mobility and consolidated surveillance datasets, producing exclusionary effects functionally analogous to redlining while evading traditional paper trails.

Count VII – Sex Discrimination – Disparate Impact of Anomaly Classification

(Title VII, Title IX, Equal Protection, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, ECOA, FCRA, State Law Analogues)
30–34. (As previously pleaded; unchanged for brevity.)

Count VIII – Existential Negligence – Disproportionate Targeting of Women and AFAB People

35–40. (As previously pleaded; unchanged for brevity.)

Count IX – State-Level Data Inputs and Gender Marker Inducement

41–46. (As previously pleaded; unchanged for brevity.)

Count X – Algorithmic Defamation and Failure to Contextualize

(With Disparate Impact on Transgender Individuals)
47–58. (As previously pleaded; unchanged for brevity.)

Count XI – Fraud by Omission in Corporate Governance (Executive Digital-Twin Concealment)

(Against Palantir Technologies Inc.)
59. Palantir engaged in fraudulent omission by concealing the extent to which its executive leadership, including CEO Alexander C. Karp, was represented, influenced, or substituted by digital twin technologies in governance, operations, contracting, and investor communications.
60. Palantir’s brand, investor confidence, and stock valuation are materially tied to Karp’s persona and purported direct human decision-making; the existence or operational use of an executive digital twin is a material fact.
61. Palantir had a duty to disclose this fact to investors, contracting partners, and the public to prevent its statements about leadership, governance, risk, and oversight from being misleading.
62. Palantir knowingly or recklessly omitted these facts, creating the false impression that corporate governance and strategic decisions were solely overseen by human leadership.
63. The omission is material because reasonable investors and contracting partners would view executive digital-twin substitution or influence as significantly altering risk, accountability, and the reliability of public statements.
64. Palantir benefited financially from this omission, including by bolstering stock value and securing contracts under false pretenses tethered to the “Karp brand.”
65. The concealed governance structure enabled and concealed broader misconduct alleged herein, including contaminated data pipelines, anomaly/NPE designations, and functional redlining.
66. As a direct and proximate result, Plaintiff suffered harm, including unauthorized creation/subletting of her digital twin, deprivation of benefits and due process, reputational harm, economic loss, and heightened targeting driven by tainted corporate decision-making.
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff seeks damages, equitable relief, and such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Reservation of Rights Concerning Election Manipulation

CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS
	67.	Plaintiff brings this action individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, pursuant to Rules 23(a), 23(b)(2), and 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
	68.	The proposed Class is defined as:

 All persons in the United States who were, at any time since January 1, 2010, subjected to anomaly classification, digital-twin modeling, NPE designation, or other context-stripped predictive labeling by Palantir Technologies Inc. or its government or contractor partners.
	69.	Excluded from the Class are Defendants, their officers and directors, and the Court and its staff.
	70.	The Class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable. Members are geographically dispersed, and the identities of many Class members can be ascertained only through Defendants’ records.
	71.	Questions of law and fact common to the Class predominate over any questions affecting only individual members. Common issues include:
 a. Whether Palantir knowingly deployed anomaly/NPE classification systems using contaminated or manipulated data;
 b. Whether Palantir sublet or sublicensed digital twins without consent or oversight;
 c. Whether Palantir’s concealment of executive digital-twin governance constitutes fraud by omission;
 d. Whether such practices deprived Class members of due process, housing, benefits, or equal protection;
 e. The appropriate measure of damages and equitable relief.
	72.	Plaintiff’s claims are typical of those of the Class. Plaintiff, like other Class members, was subject to anomaly classification, data contamination, and deprivation of rights as a result of Defendants’ misconduct.
	73.	Plaintiff will fairly and adequately represent the interests of the Class. Plaintiff has no interests antagonistic to the Class and intends to prosecute this action vigorously.
	74.	Class certification under Rule 23(b)(2) is appropriate because Defendants have acted on grounds generally applicable to the Class, rendering injunctive and declaratory relief proper.
	75.	Class certification under Rule 23(b)(3) is also appropriate because common questions predominate, and a class action is superior to individual actions for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:

a. Declare that Palantir committed fraudulent misrepresentation and that Defendants’ context-stripped classification pipelines violate due process;
b. Order disgorgement of federal funds received under “terrorism prevention” justifications;
c. Enter an injunction prohibiting Defendants from deploying or marketing classification systems that ignore context, and requiring implementation of the DQ Safeguard Rule (automatic suspension of anomaly/NPE labels when DQ ≥ threshold pending human review);
d. Order an independent audit and special master to: (i) quarantine or purge datasets contaminated by synthetic manipulations; (ii) identify individuals wrongfully labeled; (iii) restore access to federal benefits wrongfully denied;
e. Enjoin functional redlining practices via vendor continuity filters and require fair-housing compliant placement procedures;
f. Declare Defendants’ anomaly classification system discriminatory and unlawful;
g. Enjoin further use of anomaly classifications that produce sex-based disparate impacts;
h. Order full restoration of access, benefits, and opportunities denied to those wrongfully classified as anomalies;
i. Declare Defendants’ disproportionate targeting of women and AFAB people unlawful and negligent at the highest level;
j. Enjoin Defendants from continuing anomaly classification practices that create sex-based disparate impacts;
k. Order full restoration of access, opportunities, and survivability pathways denied to women and AFAB individuals through anomaly classification;
l. Declare Palantir’s concealment of executive digital-twin governance to be fraudulent omission and enjoin further nondisclosure in investor, contracting, and public communications;
m. Award compensatory and punitive damages to Plaintiff and a similarly situated class (if certified), amounts to be determined at trial;
n. Award fees, costs, and any further relief the Court deems just and proper.
