CIVIL COMPLAINT FOR FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION, UNJUST ENRICHMENT, AND CIVIL CONSPIRACY
(RE: FALSE CLAIMS TO PREVENT TERRORISM)

⸻

INTRODUCTION

Plaintiff Kellyn Clay brings this action against Palantir Technologies Inc. and its federal partners for knowingly and repeatedly misrepresenting the function and effectiveness of its surveillance platforms, particularly in claiming to “prevent terrorism.” Despite vast access to sensitive behavioral data—including search histories, movement logs, purchases, and private communications—Palantir has failed to prevent or meaningfully reduce mass violence in the United States, including domestic terrorism, school shootings, and targeted extremist acts.

Meanwhile, the company has profited extensively from federal contracts premised on these false claims, enabling the expansion of unconstitutional, unregulated behavioral tracking systems that disproportionately harm vulnerable civilians.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE
	1.	Jurisdiction is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal question), 28 U.S.C. § 1343 (civil rights), and 28 U.S.C. § 1332 (diversity of citizenship).
	2.	Venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391, as the harmful effects of Defendants’ conduct have occurred throughout the United States, including within this judicial district.

⸻

PARTIES
	3.	Plaintiff Kellyn Clay is a U.S. citizen residing within the jurisdiction of this Court.
	4.	Defendant Palantir Technologies Inc. is a private technology company headquartered in Colorado, contracting extensively with U.S. federal agencies.
	5.	Defendant United States of America is sued through its agencies for oversight failure and participation in civil conspiracy.
	6.	John Doe Contracting Agencies and Affiliates represent yet-unidentified entities acting in concert with Palantir in the deployment, justification, and concealment of the harmful systems described herein.

⸻

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
	7.	Palantir has marketed itself as a platform that enables law enforcement and intelligence agencies to “prevent terrorism,” “predict and stop threats before they happen,” and “protect national security.”
	8.	These representations were made publicly in press releases, investor calls, shareholder letters, and procurement justifications, and privately to agencies and lawmakers responsible for awarding billion-dollar contracts.
	9.	At all relevant times, Palantir had full access to extensive behavioral, biometric, financial, and geospatial data on millions of U.S. residents.
	10.	Despite this access, and despite operating in jurisdictions where numerous mass shootings occurred, Palantir’s tools failed to prevent any of the ten deadliest shootings in U.S. history, including incidents in Las Vegas, Parkland, Orlando, El Paso, Sandy Hook, and others.
	11.	Palantir knew or should have known that its predictive models were not capable of preventing mass violence, yet continued to assert otherwise.
	12.	Palantir and its partners exploited the emotional and political climate following 9/11, Sandy Hook, and other mass casualty events to secure federal contracts based on false claims of efficacy.
	13.	The Plaintiff and members of the public were never informed that the outputs of these systems would be used not to prevent terrorism, but to:

	•	Coerce behavior through predictive modeling and nudging
	•	Classify individuals as anomalies or “non-person entities”
	•	Deny due process through automated suspicion pipelines

	14.	This misrepresentation has resulted in:

	•	Mass surveillance without lawful justification
	•	Psychological and physiological harm to affected civilians
	•	Erosion of democratic accountability and individual rights

	15.	Palantir has profited massively from this false narrative, despite failing to deliver on its core promise.

CAUSES OF ACTION

⸻

Count I – Fraudulent Misrepresentation
	16.	Defendant knowingly made false claims regarding its ability to prevent terrorism and violent threats.
	17.	These statements were material, intended to induce reliance by contracting agencies and the public.
	18.	Plaintiff and the public reasonably relied on these representations, directly or through government action.
	19.	As a result, Plaintiff and similarly situated individuals suffered direct and indirect harm, including psychological abuse, rights violations, and exposure to experimental surveillance systems.

⸻

Count II – Unjust Enrichment
	20.	Palantir received billions in federal funds under the premise that its software prevented terrorism.
	21.	Those funds were not earned by fulfilling contractual goals, but by exploiting fear and misinformation.
	22.	Retention of those funds constitutes unjust enrichment at the expense of public safety and constitutional order.

⸻

Count III – Civil Conspiracy
	23.	Defendants acted in concert to construct and maintain a fraudulent narrative of “terrorism prevention” to justify mass behavioral surveillance.
	24.	These actions were coordinated, concealed, and materially advanced through public deception and procurement fraud.
	25.	Each Defendant played a role in enabling the misuse of predictive analytics against the public, with full knowledge of their ineffectiveness and the harm they would cause.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:

a. Declare that Palantir Technologies Inc. committed fraudulent misrepresentation;
b. Order disgorgement of all federal funds received under terrorism-prevention justifications;
