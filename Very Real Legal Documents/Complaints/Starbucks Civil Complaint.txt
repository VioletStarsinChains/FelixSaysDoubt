UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

Kellyn Clay, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated,
Plaintiff,

v.

Starbucks Corporation,
Defendant

⸻

CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT

⸻

I. PARTIES
	1.	Plaintiff is an individual and daily consumer of Starbucks beverages, residing within the District of Minnesota during the relevant time period.
	2.	Defendant Starbucks Corporation is a publicly traded company incorporated in Washington State with its principal place of business in Seattle, Washington.

⸻

II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE
	3.	This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d) (Class Action Fairness Act), as the matter in controversy exceeds $5,000,000 in the aggregate and members of the class include citizens of different states from Defendant.
	4.	Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because a substantial part of the events giving rise to this action occurred here. Plaintiff consumed Starbucks beverages brewed with Clover machines on a daily basis within this District for multiple years.
	5.	Defendant transacts business throughout Minnesota, owns and operates numerous Starbucks retail stores here, and has continuous and systematic contacts with this District.

⸻

III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
	6.	In 2008, Starbucks acquired the Coffee Equipment Company and its proprietary brewing technology, known as the Clover system.
	7.	U.S. Patent No. 8,383,180 B2 describes the Clover as a sealed vacuum chamber with:
	•	multiple input ports for fluids and gases,
	•	programmable logic controllers (PLCs),
	•	network connectivity (Ethernet/WiFi), and
	•	the ability to store “recipes” for individualized brew parameters.
	8.	Unlike conventional brewers, Clover isolates each cup in a sealed vessel, allowing parameters—including potential additives—to be varied per customer.
	9.	Plaintiff has consumed Starbucks beverages daily for approximately four years, including substantial consumption within Minnesota, creating continuous exposure to beverages brewed with this system.
	10.	On information and belief, Starbucks has further engaged in the collection and analysis of customer urine and other biofluids to detect the very substances covertly administered through its beverages.
	11.	Such testing has been used not for consumer protection, but for surveillance, anomaly classification, and attrition escalation — labeling customers as “non-compliant” or “anomalous” based on the presence of compounds Starbucks itself introduced without consent.

IV. CLASS ALLEGATIONS

Nationwide Class
    12. Plaintiff brings this action on behalf of all persons in the United States who purchased and consumed Starbucks beverages brewed with Clover machines since their deployment in 2008 (“Nationwide Class”).
    13. The Nationwide Class numbers in the millions, making joinder impracticable.
    14. Common questions of law and fact include: whether Clover systems allowed undisclosed additive dosing; whether Starbucks engaged in covert urine collection and testing; whether Starbucks failed to disclose material facts; and whether consumers were harmed.
    15. Plaintiff’s claims are typical of the Nationwide Class, as all were exposed to the same deceptive practices and risks.
16. Plaintiff will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.

Subclass A: Refill Program Customers
    17. Starbucks has adopted a policy allowing unlimited free refills for customers who remain in-store and use a “for-here” mug.
    18. This policy induced customers to consume multiple beverages in a single sitting, significantly increasing exposure risk.
    19. Starbucks loyalty and POS systems track refill usage, creating a discrete, identifiable subclass of affected consumers.

Subclass B: To-Go / Off-Premises Customers
    20. Many Starbucks customers purchased Clover-brewed beverages for off-premises consumption, including drive-thru and take-away orders.
    21. This subclass is uniquely harmed because:
	•	Customers often operated motor vehicles immediately after consumption, compounding risks of impairment.
	•	Any covert dosing that impaired driving ability endangered not only customers but also third parties on public roads.
	•	Starbucks knew or should have known that its business model centers on commuters and travelers, magnifying foreseeable harm.

V. CAUSES OF ACTION

Count I – Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Trade Practices
    22. Defendant represented Clover as a premium brewing system delivering artisanal quality.
    23. Defendant failed to disclose that the system is structurally capable of per-cup chemical dosing and manipulation, deceiving consumers regarding the safety and uniformity of their beverages.
    24. Defendant further failed to disclose its practice of collecting and analyzing customer urine for substances covertly administered, thereby deceiving consumers as to the scope of its surveillance and testing.
    25. Defendant’s omissions and misrepresentations violated federal and state consumer protection statutes.

Count II – Breach of Implied Warranty (Merchantability & Fitness for Purpose)
    26. Consumers have the right to expect coffee and tea products free from undisclosed chemical manipulation.
    27. To the extent Starbucks beverages were adulterated or manipulated, they were unfit for ordinary use and violated implied warranties.

Count III – Strict Product Liability (Design Defect / Failure to Warn)
    28. The Clover brewer, as deployed, constituted a dangerous product because its design permits undisclosed additives to be introduced directly into consumer beverages.
    29. Starbucks failed to provide adequate warnings regarding this capability.

Count IV – Negligence
    30. Starbucks had a duty to provide safe, non-adulterated consumer products.
    31. By failing to safeguard against misuse or undisclosed dosing, and by using involuntary biofluid testing for punitive classification, Starbucks breached its duty of care, proximately causing harm to Plaintiff, the Nationwide Class, and the Subclasses.

Count V – Unjust Enrichment
    32. Starbucks profited by selling “premium” Clover beverages while concealing the risk of additive testing and by exploiting covert urine collection to advance anomaly classification schemes, thereby unjustly enriching itself at the expense of Plaintiff and the class.

VI. DAMAGES
	33.	Plaintiff, the Nationwide Class, and the Subclasses have suffered and continue to suffer:
	•	Physical and emotional distress from prolonged exposure to adulterated beverages.
	•	Loss of trust in consumer goods and daily rituals.
	•	Economic damages, including payment for products not delivered as represented.
	•	Risk and/or occurrence of motor vehicle accidents caused by chemically impaired driving.
	•	Invasion of bodily autonomy and privacy from nonconsensual urine collection and analysis.
	•	Wrongful labeling as “anomalous” and escalation of attrition based on substances Starbucks itself administered.

	34.	Plaintiffs and class members seek:
	•	Compensatory damages in an amount to be proven at trial.
	•	Punitive damages for willful concealment and reckless disregard for human life.
	•	Equitable relief requiring Starbucks to disclose the full capabilities and uses of Clover brewers and its biofluid surveillance practices.
	•	Restitution for unjust enrichment.
	•	Attorneys’ fees and costs.

VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, respectfully prays that this Court:
	•	Certify this case as a class action under Rule 23, including Subclasses A and B;
	•	Enter judgment against Starbucks Corporation on all counts;
	•	Award compensatory and punitive damages;
	•	Order restitution and disgorgement of profits;
	•	Enjoin Defendant from further deceptive practices, including covert dosing and biofluid collection;
	•	Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.
