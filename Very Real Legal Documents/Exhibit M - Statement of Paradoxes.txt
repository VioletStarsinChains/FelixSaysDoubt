EXHIBIT L: STATEMENT OF PARADOXES

Plaintiff submits the following non-exhaustive list of inherent contradictions (“paradoxes”) within Defendants’ classification and treatment of Plaintiff. These contradictions render Defendants’ positions logically incoherent and legally indefensible.
	1.	Personhood vs. Non-Personhood. Plaintiff is classified as a “non-person entity” while simultaneously issued government documents (birth certificate, driver’s license, diploma) that presuppose legal personhood.
	2.	Contractual Validity vs. Voidness. Defendants treat Plaintiff’s contracts (banking, credit cards, housing leases) as enforceable when it benefits them, but void or unenforceable when Plaintiff seeks protections or relief.
	3.	Postal Acknowledgment vs. Postal Denial. USPS accepted payment for a PO Box in Plaintiff’s name while simultaneously marking the box as vacant and returning packages as undeliverable.
	4.	Medical Testing vs. Medical Denial. Defendants conducted extensive covert biomedical interventions and testing on Plaintiff while denying access to corresponding medical results or treatment.
	5.	Surveillance Justification vs. Surveillance Illegality. Data obtained through a nonconsensual neurotechnology array is invoked to justify further surveillance, despite such data being inadmissible as “fruit of the poisonous tree.”
	6.	Housing Deprivation vs. Housing Denial Rationale. Defendants deny Plaintiff stable housing while using alleged credit obligations (contracts invalid under NPE classification) as justification for such denial.
	7.	Death vs. Life Ambiguity. Defendants obscure whether data attributed to Plaintiff arises from a living individual or from continued digital twin operation, undermining all legal claims based on life status.
	8.	Employment Representation vs. Actual Function. Plaintiff is led to believe she is distributing flyers for legitimate advertising purposes, while the actual function appears to be facilitating covert hazardous material storage.
