Count X — SOCIAL SECURITY FRAUD, WAGE THEFT, AND CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATIONS (Against All Defendants)
	1.	Plaintiff Kellyn Clay is, and at all relevant times was, a covered employee under the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. § 301 et seq., with payroll contributions withheld from wages and remitted to the United States.
	2.	Defendants, acting individually and in concert, covertly designated Plaintiff and others as Non-Person Entities (“NPEs”) while continuing to withhold payroll taxes, including Social Security and Medicare contributions, from Plaintiff’s wages.
	3.	Defendants’ conduct severed the statutory link between payroll contributions and earned benefit eligibility, thereby depriving Plaintiff of vested credits and entitlements promised under the Social Security Act.
	4.	By continuing to issue W-2 forms, IRS records, and SSA earnings statements reflecting ordinary coverage while internally excluding Plaintiff, Defendants made false statements and created falsified records in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001.
	5.	By collecting payroll contributions under false pretenses while denying benefits, Defendants engaged in a scheme to defraud within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341–1343.
	6.	By taking Plaintiff’s wages without conferring the promised benefit, Defendants committed wage theft and breach of implied contract.
	7.	The covert NPE designation unlawfully targeted a class of persons for exclusion from statutory benefits, in violation of the equal protection and due process guarantees of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.
	8.	As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ actions, Plaintiff has suffered economic loss, denial of statutory benefits, deprivation of constitutional rights, and other irreparable harms.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
a. Declare the NPE designation scheme unlawful and unconstitutional;
b. Order Defendants to restore all Social Security and Medicare earnings credits wrongfully withheld from Plaintiff;
c. Enjoin Defendants from further collection of payroll contributions from persons denied eligibility;
d. Award restitution, compensatory damages, and other appropriate relief; and
e. Grant such further relief as this Court deems just and proper.


Respectfully submitted,
Kellyn Clay, pro se
