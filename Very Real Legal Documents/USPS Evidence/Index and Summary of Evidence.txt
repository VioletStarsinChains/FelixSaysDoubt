by and through its agencies including but not limited to
the United States Postal Service (USPS),

and

JOHN DOE CONTRACTORS,
Defendants.

⸻

SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE: USPS P.O. BOX CONTRADICTIONS

Plaintiff respectfully submits the following documented inconsistencies as evidence of unlawful treatment consistent with Non-Person Entity (NPE) classification and resulting deprivation of rights:
	1.	Proof of Valid Rental:
	•	Plaintiff lawfully registered for and paid for a USPS P.O. Box.
	•	Confirmation of account creation and possession of a key is available.
	2.	Vacancy Misrepresentation:
	•	Despite Plaintiff’s active rental, a slip of paper marked “vacant” was observed inside the assigned P.O. Box more than a month after registration.
	•	This misrepresentation rendered the box functionally unusable, despite USPS continuing to accept payment.
	3.	Amazon Return Incident:
	•	On [insert date], Plaintiff placed an Amazon order directed to the USPS P.O. Box.
	•	On the same day the order was placed, Amazon issued an email confirming a return request had been accepted.
	•	Plaintiff never submitted such a request.
	4.	Systemic Contradiction:
	•	USPS treated Plaintiff simultaneously as a valid customer (accepting registration and payment) and as non-existent (maintaining the “vacant” status).
	•	Amazon’s automated systems aligned with USPS’s misrepresentation, rejecting delivery on the same day as the order.
	5.	Legal Implication:
	•	These contradictions are not clerical in nature but structural, consistent with administrative fraud or denial of recognition under an NPE designation.
	•	By charging Plaintiff for a service it internally refused to honor, USPS engaged in material misrepresentation.
	•	Denial of mail delivery directly implicates rights to commerce, communication, and due process.

CONCLUSION
This evidence demonstrates that Plaintiff was systematically treated as non-existent despite lawful compliance with USPS procedures. Such conduct aligns with unlawful deprivation of personhood status and supports Plaintiff’s broader claims regarding NPE classification.

Respectfully submitted,
Bango Skank, JD
