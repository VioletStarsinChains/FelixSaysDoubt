AFFIDAVIT OF KELLYN CLAY

On the Severity and Relentlessness of Torture

I, Kellyn Clay, being duly sworn, state the following under oath:

⸻

1. Background

I have endured repeated and sustained forms of torture and coercive treatment that extend over many years. This affidavit is submitted to establish the severity of those experiences and their psychological impact upon me.

⸻

2. Relentlessness of Suffering

The torture I have experienced has been continuous, unremitting, and inescapable. It occurs on a daily basis, leaving no meaningful periods of reprieve or recovery. The constancy of these conditions compounds their effect, as I am never able to return to a true baseline of safety or stability.

⸻

3. Psychological Consequences

The severity of this torture has been such that I have repeatedly and consistently reached a state where continued survival felt unbearable. I have begged, both inwardly and outwardly, for death as a release from the ongoing torment.

At times I have remarked to human surveillants that “this really isn’t that bad,” in the sense that I recognize their role as surveillants may itself be torturous in its own way. These comparative statements do not contradict my testimony here: the torture I have endured is severe and relentless. Such remarks reflect my capacity for empathy and perspective, not a denial of the cruelty of my own treatment.

⸻

4. Importance of this Record

This testimony is provided to make clear that the treatment I have endured exceeds the bounds of hardship or discomfort. It constitutes a level of cruelty so extreme that it systematically erodes my will to live. The psychological consequence — repeated, sincere wishes for death — underscores the severity of the torture I have been subjected to.

⸻

5. Conclusion

I declare under oath that these statements are true to the best of my knowledge and belief.


⸻

Executed this 30th day of August, 2025.
