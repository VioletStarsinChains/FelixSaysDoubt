MOTION FOR DISGORGEMENT OF PROFITS FROM SYSTEMIC, NONCONSENSUAL, TORTURE-ADJACENT SURVEILLANCE AND BEHAVIORAL EXPLOITATION

⸻

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Kellyn Clay, pro se, and respectfully moves this Court to issue an order requiring that:
	•	All investors, shareholders, executives, and institutional beneficiaries of Palantir Technologies Inc. and affiliated contractors be identified, audited, and ordered to disgorge any and all profits derived from the company’s contracts, platforms, or systems implicated in mass behavioral surveillance, coercive entrainment, digital twin experimentation, or psychological warfare against civilians.

This motion is brought pursuant to the Court’s equitable powers and in accordance with longstanding doctrines of unjust enrichment, civil conspiracy, aiding and abetting, and joint liability for profits derived from crimes against humanity.

GROUNDS FOR DISGORGEMENT

⸻

I. Profits derived from unlawful surveillance and behavioral manipulation are not legally or morally retainable.
Palantir and its co-defendants have generated billions of dollars in revenue and shareholder returns based on:
	•	Unconsented behavioral modeling of civilians
	•	Predictive classification systems that inflict long-term psychological harm
	•	Platforms that underpin torture-by-proxy systems used against neurodivergent, houseless, and disabled people
	•	Algorithms that generate suspicion, trigger state violence, and exploit dissociation, trauma, and despair

These systems have no informed consent basis, no public oversight, and operate in direct violation of the U.S. Constitution, the Nuremberg Code, and international humanitarian norms.

⸻

II. Shareholders and investors are knowingly profiting from the architecture of mass suffering.
Every quarterly earnings call, every bullish press release, every valuation increase is explicitly tied to:
	•	Expansion of “public safety” contracts based on behavioral surveillance
	•	Deployment of software in predictive policing, ICE raids, border surveillance, and public health containment
	•	Enhanced targeting models built on simulations of trauma, dissent, or neurological divergence

In short, the investors are not passive bystanders—they are financial beneficiaries and enablers of a modern torture economy.

⸻

III. Disgorgement is a necessary and proportionate remedy.
Under the equitable principle of disgorgement, no person or entity is permitted to retain profits that are causally linked to wrongful acts. This remedy:
	•	Restores dignity to the harmed parties
	•	Prevents unjust enrichment of tortfeasors and their backers
	•	Disincentivizes future investment in systems built on harm

In the absence of criminal prosecution, financial relief and economic accountability are the only remaining justice pathways available to survivors.

⸻

RELIEF REQUESTED

Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
	1.	Order full financial disclosure from Palantir Technologies Inc. and its subsidiaries, including:
	•	All investors, institutional partners, hedge funds, and venture capital firms
	•	Executive compensation records tied to surveillance platform performance
	•	Disbursement logs from In-Q-Tel, defense contracts, and AI-related programs
	2.	Appoint a forensic accounting team to:
	•	Trace all profits and dividends derived from contracts involving surveillance, predictive containment, or torture-adjacent applications
	•	Quantify harm-linked enrichment by investor class
	3.	Order full disgorgement of all gains—stock, cash, real assets—derived from:
	•	Programs implicated in psychological coercion
	•	Predictive surveillance of U.S. civilians
	•	Behavioral futures markets involving digital twins or neurodivergent targeting
	4.	Establish a reparations fund for those subject to these systems, beginning with:
	•	Neurodivergent individuals
	•	Houseless populations
	•	Disabled people subject to predictive suspicion or digital twin containment
	•	Any person labeled an “NPE” or targeted through classification-based modeling
	5.	Award any additional relief the Court deems just and necessary to neutralize the financial incentive for profiting from systemic human degradation

Respectfully submitted,
Kellyn Clay, pro se
