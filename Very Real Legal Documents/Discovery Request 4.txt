PLAINTIFF’S EIGHTH REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS

Plaintiff requests production of any and all medical records, imaging files, radiology reports, and associated physician notes concerning an abdominal ultrasound performed on Plaintiff between 2017-2019 at any healthcare facility within the State of Minnesota (or any affiliated provider network), including but not limited to systems later acquired, merged, or rebranded.

This request specifically seeks:
	•	Original imaging files (e.g., DICOM format),
	•	Radiology technician notes,
	•	Radiologist interpretations,
	•	Any related correspondence or billing codes indicating the study was performed.

If the precise custodian cannot be identified by Plaintiff, Defendants are instructed to produce responsive documents in their possession, custody, or control, or to identify the entity believed to hold such records.

⸻ 

PURPOSE

These requests are intended to ensure Plaintiff has access to the full imaging record necessary to independently evaluate the presence of potential anatomical anomalies or covert implants, and to determine whether any providers withheld, altered, or transmitted such data without Plaintiff’s knowledge or consent.
