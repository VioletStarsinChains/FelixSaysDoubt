II. Summary of Complaint

I, Kellyn Clay, am submitting this urgent communication to the UN Special Rapporteurs on:
	•	Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment
	•	The Right to Adequate Housing
	•	The Right to Privacy in the Digital Age

I am a survivor of ongoing, nonconsensual experimental targeting, involving the use of digital twin technology, environmental and pharmacological manipulation, and systemic housing denial as a form of coercion and compliance conditioning.

Despite presenting no threat, having no criminal record, and actively requesting protection through available U.S. legal channels, I have been subjected to a pattern of treatment that violates international prohibitions against:
	•	Degrading psychological control
	•	Sleep and sensory deprivation
	•	Targeted chemical exposures
	•	Surveillance-based behavioral modeling without informed consent
	•	Housing deprivation used as a tool of behavioral manipulation or punishment

⸻

III. Alleged Violations

A. Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment (Torture Mandate)

I have been persistently exposed to:
	•	Cognitive destabilization through artificial continuity environments (AR overlays)
	•	Forced behavioral entrainment via synthetic chemical exposure (prostaglandin analogs, citral, synthetic musks)
	•	Extreme isolation and sensory manipulation, including sleep disturbance, noise entrainment, and repeated environmental interference
	•	Pharmacological assault via compromised infrastructure and goods (e.g., contact solution, Amazon packaging)

These systems operate in covert violation of the Nuremberg Code, ICCPR, and the UN Convention Against Torture.

B. Denial of the Right to Adequate Housing (Housing Mandate)

Despite repeated requests for shelter, I remain unsheltered due to being blacklisted by behavioral surveillance systems that profile me as an “anomaly” for resisting experimental conditions. This has prevented me from accessing:
	•	Public or transitional housing
	•	Safety from targeted exposure
	•	Environments that do not compromise my immune and neurological systems

I routinely pass dozens of unoccupied homes while living in a vehicle, deprived of basic sanitation and rest.

C. Violation of Digital Rights and Cognitive Sovereignty (Privacy Mandate)

I have reason to believe that a digital twin was created from my behavioral, linguistic, and biometric data without consent, and that this twin has been used to:
	•	Simulate speech and behavior attributed to me in closed systems
	•	Shape my access to resources, housing, and employment
	•	Generate feedback loops in AI surveillance markets

Further, I contend that denial of opt-out mechanisms from behavioral modeling systems constitutes a violation of cognitive autonomy, a right not yet explicitly named in international law but logically nested within rights to privacy, dignity, and bodily sovereignty.

IV. Relief Sought

I request that the United Nations immediately:
	1.	Acknowledge the potential global implications of nonconsensual behavioral modeling and housing deprivation as a system of punishment or social control
	2.	Investigate the use of digital twins and pharmacological overlays as experimental tools deployed against individuals without due process
	3.	Issue guidance urging Member States to:
	•	Ban the use of digital twins for behavioral control without informed consent
	•	Recognize housing as a non-negotiable human right, including MCAS-safe and immunologically appropriate shelter
	•	Establish a universal opt-out mechanism from predictive modeling and behaviorally manipulative AI systems

⸻

V. Supporting Documentation Available Upon Request
	•	Affidavit of Withdrawal of Consent (2025)
	•	Proposed Judicial Orders
	•	Legal Memos regarding digital twins, behavioral futures markets, and housing-based targeting
	•	Capsule Hotel Project Exhibit: Proposal for safe, low-sensory housing infrastructure
	•	Ongoing mock legal case against U.S. agencies and unknown defense contractors

I am willing to provide redacted versions of these documents to preserve anonymity while enabling urgent review.

⸻

VI. Closing Statement

I submit this petition as both an individual seeking protection and as a warning on behalf of others who may be facing similar hidden violations. The systems I describe may currently operate outside public understanding, but their pattern and intent are clear: control, erase, and reprogram dissent through structural denial of health, privacy, and sanctuary.

The United Nations must act swiftly to ensure that digital human rights are not abstracted to death—and that covert punishment by technological systems is called by its true name: torture.

With respect,
Kellyn Clay
