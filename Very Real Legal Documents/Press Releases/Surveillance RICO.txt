PRESS RELEASE

For Immediate Distribution

⸻ 

Surveillance is a Racket

⸻

The Enterprise
	•	A global association-in-fact enterprise linking:
	•	Consumer-facing companies (e.g., Starbucks, social media platforms).
	•	Data brokers (Acxiom, Experian, Oracle).
	•	Predictive analytics firms (Palantir, hedge-fund quants, ad exchanges).
	•	Cloud/infrastructure providers (AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure).
	•	End users (insurers, advertisers, government agencies).

⸻

Pattern of Racketeering Activity
	•	Wire fraud: Behavioral data marketed as authentic when it is chemically/manipulatively altered, then transmitted across interstate networks.
	•	Food and drug violations: Undisclosed additives in consumer products (sauces, syrups, honey packets) altering mood or cognition.
	•	Money laundering: Fraud-derived proceeds cycled through predictive analytics and futures markets.
	•	Continuous and systemic — billions of predicate acts daily.

⸻

Commerce
	•	Behavioral data is an interstate commodity, bought and sold globally.
	•	A cup of coffee in Minneapolis becomes a behavioral futures contract in New York or London within hours.

⸻

Injury
	•	Individuals: Gastro distress, cognitive fog, emotional numbing, reputational harm (see affidavits of Kellyn Clay).
	•	Markets: Investors and insurers misled by tainted data in predictive models.
	•	Democracy: Free expression chilled when behavior is coerced or entrained.

⸻

The 48-Hour Rule
	•	Behavioral data collected within 48 hours of consumption of tainted products (e.g., Starbucks Clover beverages with sauces) is corrupted.
	•	Using such data in predictive modeling is reckless at best, fraudulent at worst.

⸻

Conclusion

Behavioral futures markets are not neutral innovation. They are structurally criminal enterprises under RICO:
	•	Enterprise: The surveillance ecosystem.
	•	Pattern: Continuous wire fraud and data adulteration.
	•	Commerce: Interstate behavioral data trades.
	•	Injury: To people, markets, and democratic institutions.

The entire surveillance ecosystem is guilty of racketeering.
