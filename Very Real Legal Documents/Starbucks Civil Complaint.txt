UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA

Plaintiff
v.
Starbucks Corporation
Defendant

⸻

COMPLAINT

Plaintiff, by way of complaint against Defendant Starbucks Corporation, alleges as follows:

⸻

I. PARTIES
	1.	Plaintiff is an individual and daily consumer of Starbucks beverages, residing within the District of Minnesota during the relevant time period.
	2.	Defendant Starbucks Corporation is a publicly traded company incorporated in Washington State with its principal place of business in Seattle, Washington.

⸻

II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE
	3.	This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332, as the matter in controversy exceeds $75,000 and is between citizens of different states.
	4.	Venue is proper in the District of Minnesota under 28 U.S.C. § 1391 because a substantial part of the events giving rise to this action occurred here. Plaintiff consumed Starbucks beverages brewed with Clover machines on a daily basis within this District for multiple years.
	5.	Defendant transacts business throughout Minnesota, owns and operates numerous Starbucks retail stores here, and has continuous and systematic contacts with this District.

⸻

III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
	6.	In 2008, Starbucks acquired the Coffee Equipment Company and its proprietary brewing technology, known as the Clover system.
	7.	U.S. Patent No. 8,383,180 B2 describes the Clover as a sealed vacuum chamber with:
	•	multiple input ports for fluids and gases,
	•	programmable logic controllers (PLCs),
	•	network connectivity (Ethernet/WiFi), and
	•	the ability to store “recipes” for individualized brew parameters ￼.
	8.	Unlike conventional brewers, Clover isolates each cup in a sealed vessel, allowing parameters—including potential additives—to be varied per customer.
	9.	Plaintiff has consumed Starbucks beverages daily for approximately four years, including substantial consumption within Minnesota, creating continuous exposure to beverages brewed with this system.

IV. CAUSES OF ACTION

Count I – Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Trade Practices
10. Defendant represented Clover as a premium brewing system delivering artisanal quality.
11. Defendant failed to disclose that the system is structurally capable of per-cup chemical dosing and manipulation, deceiving consumers regarding the safety and uniformity of their beverages.
12. Defendant’s omissions and misrepresentations violated federal and Minnesota consumer protection laws.

Count II – Breach of Implied Warranty (Merchantability & Fitness for Purpose)
13. Consumers have the right to expect coffee and tea products free from undisclosed chemical manipulation.
14. To the extent Starbucks beverages were adulterated or manipulated, they were unfit for ordinary use and violated implied warranties.

Count III – Strict Product Liability (Design Defect / Failure to Warn)
15. The Clover brewer, as deployed, constituted a dangerous product because its design permits undisclosed additives to be introduced directly into consumer beverages.
16. Starbucks failed to provide adequate warnings regarding this capability.

Count IV – Negligence
17. Starbucks had a duty to provide safe, non-adulterated consumer products.
18. By failing to safeguard against misuse or undisclosed dosing, Starbucks breached its duty of care, proximately causing harm to Plaintiff.

Count V – Unjust Enrichment
19. Starbucks profited by selling “premium” Clover beverages while concealing the risk of additive testing, thereby unjustly enriching itself at Plaintiff’s expense.

V. DAMAGES
	20.	Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer:

	•	Physical and emotional distress from prolonged exposure to potentially adulterated beverages.
	•	Loss of trust in consumer goods and daily rituals.
	•	Economic damages, including payment for products not delivered as represented.

	21.	Plaintiff seeks:

	•	Compensatory damages in excess of $75,000.
	•	Punitive damages for willful concealment.
	•	Equitable relief requiring Starbucks to disclose the full capabilities and uses of Clover brewers.
	•	Attorneys’ fees and costs.

⸻

VI. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully prays that this Court:
	•	Enter judgment against Starbucks Corporation on all counts;
	•	Award compensatory and punitive damages;
	•	Enjoin Defendant from further deceptive practices;
	•	Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.
