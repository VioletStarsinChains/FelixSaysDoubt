SUMMARY OF REFERRAL

This document serves as a formal criminal referral regarding Amazon.com, Inc., based on a pattern of conduct constituting criminal fraud under federal law, including but not limited to violations of:
	•	18 U.S.C. § 1341 (Mail Fraud)
	•	18 U.S.C. § 1343 (Wire Fraud)
	•	18 U.S.C. § 1001 (False Statements)
	•	18 U.S.C. § 1365 (Tampering with Consumer Products)

STATEMENT OF FACTS
	1.	Mislabeled and Substituted Products.
Over an extended period, I have received from Amazon products that were not what they were advertised to be. This includes supplements, medications, hygiene items, and food products that were materially different from what was listed online or described on the packaging. These substitutions were not clerical or accidental errors, but part of a repeated and systemic pattern.
	2.	Deliberate Shipment Interference.
Amazon has repeatedly delayed shipments of essential medications, including but not limited to antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers, that are necessary to my survival. These delays occurred without justification, even when items were marked “in stock” and when I paid for expedited shipping.
	3.	Life-Threatening Consequences.
As a disabled individual with medically documented mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), delayed or tampered medication has resulted in:
	•	Extended anaphylactic episodes
	•	Organ and neurological damage
	•	Emergency interventions or hospital-level risk
	•	Severe deprivation of sleep, food, and basic safety
	4.	Pattern and Intent.
The frequency and severity of these incidents strongly suggest knowledge and willfulness, not isolated error. These acts occurred in a context of targeted behavioral manipulation and entrapment, consistent with broader patterns I have documented in relation to behavioral futures markets and surveillance-linked coercion.
