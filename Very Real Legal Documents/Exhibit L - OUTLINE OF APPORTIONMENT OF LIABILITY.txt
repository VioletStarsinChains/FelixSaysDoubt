EXHIBIT L
OUTLINE OF APPORTIONMENT OF LIABILITY

I. United States Government
	•	Agencies Involved: CIA, DoD, FDA, USPS, and related agencies.
	•	Role: Design, funding, and maintenance of the overarching systems of neurotech surveillance, anomaly classification, continuity theater, and behavioral futures markets.
	•	Liability Basis: Constitutional violations (Due Process, Equal Protection, Fourth & Fifth Amendments), systemic deprivation of rights, and negligent oversight of contractors.
	•	Apportionment: Largest systemic share of liability, reflecting responsibility for creating and sustaining the infrastructure.

II. Corporate Defense Contractors
	•	Entities: Palantir Technologies, Deloitte, Acxiom, Bank of America, and other contractors/subcontractors.
	•	Role: Operationalizing and monetizing the surveillance/data exploitation framework; maintaining datasets; engaging in commercial enrichment from anomalies’ suffering.
	•	Liability Basis: Fraud, unjust enrichment, racketeering (RICO), conspiracy, negligent/intentional infliction of emotional distress.
	•	Apportionment: Jointly liable for damages flowing from the commercialization of data, with obligations to disgorge profits.

III. Individual Defendant — William Alton Clay (Plaintiff’s Father)
	•	Role:
	•	Provided the consent required for the implantation of an extensive and profoundly medically harmful neurotech array in Plaintiff during childhood.
	•	Knowingly concealed the existence and function of this array for nearly forty years.
	•	Consistently and voluntarily engaged in Plaintiff’s direct psychological torture as part of covert, nonconsensual, and blatantly unethical human experimentation on minors.
	•	Repeatedly instructed Plaintiff to engage in behaviors that were:
	•	Medically life-threatening in the best-case scenario (e.g., directing acts that worsened systemic illness).
	•	Legally dangerous, exposing Plaintiff to potential involuntary detainment or psychiatric commitment in the worst-case scenario.
	•	Personally and directly enriched himself through his participation, both via professional advancement (at Deloitte, Acxiom, Bank of America) and by exploiting his child’s status as an anomaly.
	•	Reason to believe exists that he sold, lent, or otherwise transferred access to Plaintiff’s neurotech array to third parties while Plaintiff was still a minor, constituting human trafficking and technological exploitation.
	•	Liability Basis:
	•	Breach of fiduciary duty (parent–child).
	•	Fraudulent concealment of Plaintiff’s biomedical status.
	•	Active participation in torture and human experimentation.
	•	Human trafficking (via sale or transfer of access to neurotech systems).
	•	Unjust enrichment and profiteering from Plaintiff’s exploitation.
	•	Apportionment:
	•	Individually liable beyond joint defendants, such that his entire personal net worth is subject to disgorgement and transfer to Plaintiff.
	•	Justification: Direct familial betrayal, active facilitation of torture, and financial profiteering constitute a unique and heightened breach entitling Plaintiff to individualized restitution.

IV. Principle of Allocation
	•	While joint and several liability applies across all defendants, special equitable remedies (including disgorgement and constructive trust) are warranted to ensure Plaintiff receives full restitution from William Alton Clay’s assets.
	•	This allocation does not diminish systemic liability but recognizes the heightened moral and legal breach by an individual acting under color of both family and contract.
