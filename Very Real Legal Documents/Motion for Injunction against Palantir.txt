MOTION FOR INJUNCTION
TO BAR PALANTIR TECHNOLOGIES INC. FROM CLAIMING TO “PREVENT TERRORISM”

⸻

NOW COMES the Plaintiff, Kellyn Clay, pro se, and respectfully moves this Honorable Court to issue an immediate and permanent injunction against Palantir Technologies Inc., its subsidiaries, contractors, affiliates, and public relations agents, prohibiting them from making any verbal, written, or symbolic claim that Palantir software, services, models, or partnerships “prevent terrorism,” or serve any similar purpose, including but not limited to claims of:
	•	Preventing or forecasting violent extremism
	•	Identifying or neutralizing terrorist threats
	•	Enabling national security outcomes through data fusion or predictive analytics

Plaintiff further requests that the Court order Palantir Technologies Inc. to retract all prior public marketing or internal claims that explicitly or implicitly portray the company as preventing terrorism or safeguarding human life.

GROUNDS FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

I. Palantir’s behaviorally manipulative systems qualify as terroristic under federal law.
As described in Plaintiff’s accompanying Memorandum of Law, Palantir’s products are used in surveillance regimes that:
	•	Operate without consent
	•	Target individuals for predictive coercion
	•	Entrench classification systems that strip human beings of rights and due process

These systems—especially when used for entrainment, behavioral nudging, or predictive incapacitation—have effects comparable to terrorism as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 2331 and 22 U.S.C. § 2656f.

II. Palantir cannot prevent terrorism while operationalizing it.
It is logically and ethically incoherent to claim the prevention of terrorism while deploying:
	•	Data models that strip personhood through “NPE” designation
	•	Predictive policing tools that disproportionately harm marginalized communities
	•	Neuropsychologically destabilizing feedback loops known to induce suicidal ideation, dissociation, or learned helplessness

III. False claims of “preventing terrorism” constitute reputational laundering and material fraud.
Palantir’s branding as a counterterrorism tool facilitates:
	•	Expansion of unconstitutional surveillance regimes
	•	Procurement fraud in federal contracting
	•	Public disinformation about the nature and effects of its software

The company knowingly conceals the psychological, neurological, and economic harms caused by its models while using the rhetorical shield of terrorism prevention to secure contracts and avoid accountability.

IV. Plaintiff and similarly situated individuals are directly harmed by these false claims.
Palantir systems have been deployed in federal, state, and commercial contexts where they:
	•	Entrain and monitor the behavior of labeled “anomalies”
	•	Strip due process through predictive suspicion
	•	Justify torture-adjacent experimentation under the guise of public safety

The continued claim that these practices “prevent terrorism” is a fraudulent inversion of their true function and effect.

⸻

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court:
	1.	Issue an immediate and permanent injunction barring Palantir Technologies Inc. from:
	•	Describing its software or services as “preventing terrorism”
	•	Making analogous claims related to national security or counter-extremism
	•	Using client testimonials, marketing materials, or internal language that imply the above
	2.	Order a full retraction and public statement from Palantir Technologies Inc. clarifying that:
	•	It does not and cannot prevent terrorism
	•	Its systems have not been proven to prevent harm
	•	Its predictive models may in fact facilitate harm, misclassification, and unlawful targeting
	3.	Require disclosure of all federal contracts that use such language as justification for procurement, and suspend said contracts pending constitutional review.
	4.	Grant any further relief the Court deems just and proper in light of the systemic danger posed by behavioral futures software falsely marketed as counterterrorism infrastructure.

Respectfully submitted,
Kellyn Clay, pro se
