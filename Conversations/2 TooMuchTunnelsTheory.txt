KC: i'm being reminded of three youtube videos: one about a time when mines (salt?) underneath a lake collapsed and sucked in multiple boats on the lake; Centralia, PA and specifically a kid who almost fell into a deep chasm that opened up in his backyard; and a giant sinkhole that opened semi-recently somewhere in Latin America. And then a fourth: the network of tunnels found recently in Orthodox Jewish communities in NYC.  It sounds like hollow earth nonsense is a fantasy version of something very real and relevant to climate change.

CG: Yeah — those examples you’re recalling are all real-world geological or structural void events, and when you line them up, they make “hollow earth” seem less like a far-out myth and more like an exaggerated cultural echo of very real collapses, subsidence, and hidden infrastructure.

Here’s the quick tour:

⸻

1. Lake Peigneur, Louisiana (1980)
	•	A Texaco oil drilling rig punctured into the Diamond Crystal salt mine under Lake Peigneur.
	•	The mine flooded, creating a giant whirlpool that swallowed 11 barges, a drilling platform, and part of an island.
	•	The lake actually reversed flow for a while as it drained into the mine.
	•	It’s a classic “solid ground turns out not to be solid” moment.

⸻

2. Centralia, Pennsylvania (since 1962)
	•	An underground coal seam fire has been burning for decades.
	•	In 1981, 12-year-old Todd Domboski fell into a 150-foot-deep sinkhole that opened in his grandmother’s backyard — hot steam and carbon monoxide were pouring out of it.
	•	The whole town has been abandoned due to the ongoing instability and gas.

⸻

3. Guatemala City sinkholes (2007 & 2010)
	•	Caused by leaking sewer systems and volcanic pumice in the soil.
	•	The 2010 one was about 60 feet wide and 300 feet deep, swallowing a three-story building.
	•	These look like straight-down holes — unnervingly symmetrical.

⸻

4. Brooklyn “secret tunnels” (2023/2024)
	•	Discovered under a Chabad synagogue in Crown Heights.
	•	Theories vary — some say part of an illegal expansion, others a ritual bath network or escape route — but they were substantial enough to cause structural issues and attract law enforcement.
	•	This is more human-made than natural collapse, but it’s still “hollow earth” in the sense of hidden, navigable cavities under everyday space.

⸻

How this connects to climate change:
	•	Thawing permafrost → new sinkholes and methane blowouts in the Arctic.
	•	Over-extraction of groundwater → land subsidence in places like California’s Central Valley and Mexico City.
	•	Rising sea levels & erosion → undermining coastal infrastructure.
	•	Mining and drilling → leaving behind voids that collapse decades later.

The “hollow earth” myth, in this light, is like a narrative condensation of all these real events: unseen spaces underfoot, potentially vast, sometimes dangerous, sometimes purposeful. The fantasy version imagines a whole other civilization down there; the real version is patchwork — salt mines, coal seams, storm drains, utility tunnels — but it’s happening right now, and climate stressors are going to make it more common.

If you want, I can map this into a FOIA angle that ties geological instability, climate change, and hidden infrastructure together — something that would catch a journalist’s eye. That’s actually a great “bait” topic because it sits at the intersection of environment, public safety, and urban myth.
