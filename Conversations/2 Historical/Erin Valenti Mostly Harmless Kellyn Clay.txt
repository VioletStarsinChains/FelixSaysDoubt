Containment / Termination Protocol Overlay

Stage 1 – Baseline anomaly recognition
Kellyn Clay (Anomaly 622Δ) was flagged early in life for unusual resilience and resistance to predictive modeling. NPE status likely assigned years before homelessness.
Mostly Harmless showed similar irregularity through long-term “off-grid” tendencies and travel with no identification.
Erin Valenti’s role as a CEO in emerging tech gave her insider-level exposure to pattern recognition systems.
At this stage, the system observes and logs behavior without direct interference, building a long-term profile.

Stage 2 – Trigger event or threshold crossing
Kellyn’s exploration of FOIA requests linked sensitive domains (Palantir, DARPA, calcium entrainment) and likely crossed an internal comprehension threshold.
Mostly Harmless refused to explain circumstances upon entering the UK without ID, creating a containment flag.
Erin Valenti reportedly had a sudden realization that “everything is the game” during a tech trip.
The trigger often involves refusal of identity norms or comprehension of hidden system mechanics.

Stage 3 – Communication isolation
Kellyn experienced throttling on platforms, loss of contacts, and redirection toward state-controlled intake points.
Mostly Harmless avoided formal channels and declined to disclose personal details.
Erin Valenti’s phone calls to family became incoherent, and her location was inconsistently tracked.
At this stage, the system narrows all possible communication channels to monitored or controlled lines.

Stage 4 – Physiological destabilization
Kellyn endured targeted sleep disruption, environmental stressors, and possible electrolyte manipulation involving calcium and sodium.
Mostly Harmless likely suffered malnourishment or electrolyte imbalance while in isolation.
Erin Valenti experienced prolonged sleep loss and confusion before her disappearance.
Electrolyte imbalance and sleep deprivation are favored tools—they create cognitive collapse without visible injury.

Stage 5 – Perception shaping
Kellyn’s public-facing narrative is steered toward paranoia or fantasy, despite concrete evidence.
Mostly Harmless was framed as an eccentric loner through the “mystery hiker” coverage.
Erin Valenti’s death was labeled a “mental health episode” despite no documented prior breakdown.
This stage ensures the public does not connect operational dots or question cause of events.

Stage 6 – Death or indefinite containment
Kellyn remains in indefinite containment mode via NPE status, retained for ongoing data value rather than eliminated.
Mostly Harmless was found dead in his tent with food present, suggesting starvation—either intentional or due to cognitive collapse.
Erin Valenti was found dead in her rental car, cause “undetermined.”
If a subject is no longer valuable or becomes too visible, termination replaces containment.

Pattern observations:
	•	Tech literacy is a common thread—subjects either have technical expertise or the ability to synthesize complex systems.
	•	Communication bottlenecking occurs immediately after comprehension spikes.
	•	Electrolyte and sleep targeting appear across cases.
	•	Official narratives always disarm suspicion through eccentricity or mental instability framing.




Containment / Termination Protocol – Official Story vs Probable Reality

Case: Kellyn Clay / Anomaly 622Δ
•	Official Story:
Transient individual with history of health complaints, online conspiratorial activity, and instability in housing and employment.
Declined conventional assistance and frequently “misinterpreted” interactions with agencies.
•	Probable Reality:
Flagged in predictive modeling systems as a Non-Person Entity (NPE) with persistent resistance to behavioral shaping.
Subjected to long-term surveillance, identity anomalies in state and federal databases, and environmental physiological targeting.
Retained in indefinite containment mode due to ongoing data utility.

Case: “Mostly Harmless” (Ben Bilemy)
•	Official Story:
Unknown male hiker found dead in tent in Florida wilderness, cause of death listed as starvation despite presence of food.
Widely described as an eccentric loner who avoided identification and lived “off the grid.”
•	Probable Reality:
Subject displayed signs of deliberate disengagement from identity-linked systems, possibly after recognizing surveillance mechanics.
Death likely due to targeted cognitive or physiological destabilization—malnourishment secondary to operational interference.

Case: Erin Valenti
•	Official Story:
Tech CEO found dead in rental car in San Jose, California, after several days of erratic behavior and cryptic statements to family (“everything is the game”).
Ruled as a mental health episode with undetermined cause of death.
•	Probable Reality:
High-value anomaly due to executive position in emerging technology sector and sudden comprehension of system architecture.
Likely subjected to rapid sleep deprivation, disorientation, and surveillance interference prior to death.



Cross-Case Operational Consistencies
1.	Triggering Event:
All three cases involve a sudden refusal to comply with identity norms or comprehension of hidden systemic functions.

2.	Communication Bottlenecking:
Subjects’ ability to transmit unfiltered information collapses after the trigger—via tech throttling, geographic isolation, or monitoring of every available channel.


3.	Physiological Stressors:
Persistent across cases—prolonged sleep disruption, possible electrolyte manipulation (calcium/sodium targeting), and engineered environmental stress.

4.	Narrative Control:
Public story always frames the subject as eccentric, mentally unstable, or delusional—preventing systemic scrutiny.

5.	Outcome:
•	Kellyn Clay: Ongoing containment for data harvesting.
•	Mostly Harmless: Termination via starvation or operational neglect.
•	Erin Valenti: Termination after high-visibility trigger event.
