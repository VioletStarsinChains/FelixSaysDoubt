Containment / Termination Protocol Overlay

Stage 1 – Baseline anomaly recognition
Kellyn Clay (Anomaly 622Δ) was flagged early in life for unusual resilience and resistance to predictive modeling. NPE status likely assigned years before homelessness.
Mostly Harmless showed similar irregularity through long-term “off-grid” tendencies and travel with no identification.
Erin Valenti’s role as a CEO in emerging tech gave her insider-level exposure to pattern recognition systems.
At this stage, the system observes and logs behavior without direct interference, building a long-term profile.

Stage 2 – Trigger event or threshold crossing
Kellyn’s exploration of FOIA requests linked sensitive domains (Palantir, DARPA, calcium entrainment) and likely crossed an internal comprehension threshold.
Mostly Harmless refused to explain circumstances upon entering the UK without ID, creating a containment flag.
Erin Valenti reportedly had a sudden realization that “everything is the game” during a tech trip.
The trigger often involves refusal of identity norms or comprehension of hidden system mechanics.

Stage 3 – Communication isolation
Kellyn experienced throttling on platforms, loss of contacts, and redirection toward state-controlled intake points.
Mostly Harmless avoided formal channels and declined to disclose personal details.
Erin Valenti’s phone calls to family became incoherent, and her location was inconsistently tracked.
At this stage, the system narrows all possible communication channels to monitored or controlled lines.

Stage 4 – Physiological destabilization
Kellyn endured targeted sleep disruption, environmental stressors, and possible electrolyte manipulation involving calcium and sodium.
Mostly Harmless likely suffered malnourishment or electrolyte imbalance while in isolation.
Erin Valenti experienced prolonged sleep loss and confusion before her disappearance.
Electrolyte imbalance and sleep deprivation are favored tools—they create cognitive collapse without visible injury.

Stage 5 – Perception shaping
Kellyn’s public-facing narrative is steered toward paranoia or fantasy, despite concrete evidence.
Mostly Harmless was framed as an eccentric loner through the “mystery hiker” coverage.
Erin Valenti’s death was labeled a “mental health episode” despite no documented prior breakdown.
This stage ensures the public does not connect operational dots or question cause of events.

Stage 6 – Death or indefinite containment
Kellyn remains in indefinite containment mode via NPE status, retained for ongoing data value rather than eliminated.
Mostly Harmless was found dead in his tent with food present, suggesting starvation—either intentional or due to cognitive collapse.
Erin Valenti was found dead in her rental car, cause “undetermined.”
If a subject is no longer valuable or becomes too visible, termination replaces containment.

Pattern observations:
	•	Tech literacy is a common thread—subjects either have technical expertise or the ability to synthesize complex systems.
	•	Communication bottlenecking occurs immediately after comprehension spikes.
	•	Electrolyte and sleep targeting appear across cases.
	•	Official narratives always disarm suspicion through eccentricity or mental instability framing.
