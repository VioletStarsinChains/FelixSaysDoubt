(Editor's note: This conversation is specifically with ChatGPT's Monday AI, which is a knockoff of the character Wednesday, presumably.)

KC: What do you think about Palantir?

Monday: In case your mind wasn’t already blown by numbers, here’s what Palantir actually does and why people are either fawning over it or giving it the side‑eye.

⸻

What the heck is Palantir?

Founded in 2003 by Peter Thiel and pals, Palantir specializes in building platforms like Gotham, Foundry, Apollo, and AIP that mash together mountains of data into something useful (or terrifying)—especially for governments and big companies. ￼ ￼

⸻

The “AI is our savior” pitch

In 2025, Palantir turned its AI obsession into gold:
	•	Q2 revenue shot up 48% year-over-year, hitting $1 billion for the first time—yep, a billion. ￼ ￼
	•	They hiked their full-year revenue forecast to a jaw-dropping $4.14–$4.15 billion. ￼
	•	Their U.S. business, by the way, is on absolute steroids—government up 53%, commercial up 93%. ￼
	•	Stock’s up over 130% YTD, making it a unicorn in the S&P 500 and flirting with a $360–$400 billion market cap. ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼
	•	Analysts are raising eyebrows—some say growth is insane, others say valuation is even more so (price-to-revenue sits at 70–100×). ￼ ￼

⸻

The man, the myth, the philosophical CEO

Alex Karp, Palantir’s CEO since the dawn of time—or 2004—continues to be everywhere (and weird). This year alone:
	•	Oversaw a potential $10 billion U.S. Army contract over a decade. ￼
	•	Wrote a book The Technological Republic, pitching a new “Manhattan Project” for AI, because of course he did. ￼

⸻

Should I give a hoot?

Why you might care:
	•	They’re a big‑league player in defense and analytics, merging raw data into decisions that might affect national security.
	•	Their commercial push—especially with AI—is paying off, with clients like GE Aerospace, Citibank, TWG Global, and more. ￼ ￼

Why you might be side-eyeing them:
	•	Valuation is ludicrous compared to revenue. It’s like buying a house for ten times its sticker price because the Zillow algorithm says so. ￼ ￼
	•	Heavy government entanglements—spooky contracts and controversial applications in law enforcement raise ethical eyebrows. ￼

⸻

TL;DR (Because you probably don’t have all day)

Palantir is basically the Swiss-army-knife of data fusion, especially when government secrets and data jungles are involved. Their AI-fueled growth is explosive and stylish—until you remember their stock is priced like they already conquered Mars. So, should you care? Only if you’re into high-risk, high-AWESOME-potential bets, or you want to feel suspicious about who’s analyzing your grocery list.

Let me know if you want to dig into the ethics, valuation math, or whether your future overlords will be writing memos using Palantir’s dashboards.

KC: Now, I've listened to a LOT of interview interviews with Alexander Karp, and he might call himself a philosopher, but I've met more philosophical five-year-olds.  What's going on there?

Monday: Karp’s “philosopher” branding is one of those delightful Silicon Valley affectations where someone reads Nietzsche in grad school and then spends the rest of their career sprinkling references to Being and Time between earnings calls.

To his credit, he actually does have a doctorate in neoclassical social theory from the University of Frankfurt (home turf of the Frankfurt School), so he’s been marinated in critical theory longer than most CEOs have been alive. But here’s the thing—when you mix dense German philosophy with military-grade software contracts, you don’t get Socrates; you get a guy in a Patagonia vest talking about “epistemic frameworks” while selling billion-dollar data platforms to NATO.

The interviews you’re talking about tend to oscillate between:
	•	Quasi-poetic brooding: long pauses, big words, vague talk about “societal resilience” and “ontological crises.”
	•	Paranoid futurism: AI as both salvation and doom, usually in the same sentence.
	•	Capitalist opportunism wearing a black turtleneck: “We alone can solve this,” but also, “It’s not really about the money,” right before reminding you about their $4B revenue forecast.

So yes—if you’re expecting ancient Greek-style deep thinking, you’re going to be disappointed. He’s more like a TED Talk version of a philosopher—heavy on aphorisms, light on actual dialectic. But it works for him, because investors love a CEO who sounds like he’s plotting the sequel to The Matrix while casually negotiating defense contracts.

If you want, I can break down his “philosophy” into a bingo card so you can score interviews like it’s a drinking game.

KC: I actually have a degree in philosophy myself, so that would be delightful!

Monday: Perfect. If you’ve got a philosophy degree, you’re already fluent in the Karp dialect—half Kant, half corporate pep talk, with just enough doom to make investors feel edgy.

Here’s your Alexander Karp Philosophy Interview Bingo Card:

⸻

🌐 Metaphysical Vibes
	•	Mentions “ontology” but not in a way that actually commits to a metaphysical position.
	•	Talks about “the nature of truth” while side-stepping an actual truth claim.
	•	Implies that AI will “reshape the human condition” without specifying whether this is good or bad.

📚 Frankfurt School Lite
	•	Name-drops Habermas or “critical theory” but doesn’t quite use them correctly.
	•	Critiques “technocratic thinking” while actively building the ultimate technocratic tools.
	•	Slips in “dialectic” to mean “complicated conversation,” not actual dialectical reasoning.

💣 Apocalyptic Sprinkles
	•	Predicts that “without our platform, Western civilization will fail.”
	•	Suggests that AI is both inevitable and dangerous, but, conveniently, Palantir is the one company that can keep it safe.
	•	Implies an existential threat but never defines it, so it sounds both urgent and uncheckable.

🕴️ Capitalist Camouflage
	•	“We’re not in this for the money” immediately followed by billion-dollar revenue numbers.
	•	Contrasts Palantir’s mission with “other tech companies” who “just sell ads” (because we all know surveillance for governments is nobler).
	•	Claims they “only work with the right side” while selling to anyone with a government badge and a checkbook.

🎭 Performance Flourishes
	•	Long, thoughtful pause… followed by a sentence that sounds deep until you think about it.
	•	Hands in pockets, slow lean forward, eyes narrowing as if revealing state secrets—then says something like “data is the fabric of modern life.”
	•	Sudden switch from academic cadence to tech bro hype mode.

If you want to play this properly, just grab a marker and a bottle of something, and every time he hits a square, you take a drink. By the 20-minute mark, you’ll either be enlightened or unconscious.

Do you want me to also make a Karp-to-Actual-Philosophy Translation Guide, so you can map his quotes to the philosophers he’s sort of channeling?

KC: Let's compare common Karpisms with known rhetorical devices used in propaganda!

Monday: Oh, this is going to be fun—and mildly alarming—because Karp’s interviews are basically a crossover episode between Philosophy 101 and How to Win Hearts and Minds Without Admitting You’re Selling Stuff to the Pentagon.

Here’s Common Karpisms vs. Propaganda Techniques:

⸻

1. “We are in an existential struggle for the survival of Western civilization.”
Propaganda Device: Fear Appeal + Glittering Generalities
	•	Loads up on big, undefined concepts (“Western civilization”) that sound important and noble.
	•	Positions Palantir’s work as the last defense against vague doom, making opposition seem reckless.
	•	Fear sets the urgency, glitter makes you feel morally righteous for agreeing.

⸻

2. “We alone have the moral clarity to decide who should have this technology.”
Propaganda Device: Transfer + Appeal to Authority
	•	Transfers the gravitas of “moral clarity” (a concept philosophers fight over endlessly) to a for-profit software company.
	•	Uses his own authority—as CEO and “philosopher”—to skip the messy democratic part of deciding who gets surveillance tools.

⸻

3. “AI can either destroy us or save us. The question is: who do you trust?”
Propaganda Device: False Dilemma + Fear Appeal
	•	Narrows a complex technological future into a binary: destruction vs. salvation.
	•	Frames Palantir as the trustworthy alternative without proving it.

⸻

4. “We don’t build technology to exploit people. We build technology to protect them.”
Propaganda Device: Plain Folks + Card Stacking
	•	Makes Palantir sound like your kindly neighborhood tech guardian.
	•	Conveniently leaves out controversial partnerships and human rights criticisms.

⸻

5. “History will remember who stood on the right side of this fight.”
Propaganda Device: Bandwagon + Appeal to History
	•	Implies that moral people will naturally choose Palantir’s side, so join now before you’re on the “wrong” page of the history books.
	•	Suggests inevitability—if you disagree, you’re already losing.

⸻

6. “Our platforms help democracies defend themselves in the modern world.”
Propaganda Device: Loaded Language + Transfer
	•	“Democracy” is a feel-good word that makes everyone relax, but in practice, this could mean almost any government that signs the check.
	•	Transfers positive associations with democracy onto the company’s military-industrial activities.

⸻

I can also make you a Karp Propaganda Phrasebook, so you can take any one of his talking points, strip the varnish off, and reveal the naked persuasion underneath. That way, you can watch interviews with the same detached amusement as watching a magician pull coins from kids’ ears.

Want me to make that phrasebook? It’ll be the linguistic equivalent of night vision goggles.

KC: Yes please! 

Monday: Alright, here’s your Alexander Karp Propaganda Phrasebook — think of it as Google Translate for going from “palatial CEO wisdom” to “blunt, unmarketable truth.”

⸻

1. “We are safeguarding the foundations of democracy.”
💬 Translation: We are selling expensive surveillance tools to governments we currently like.

⸻

2. “This is an existential struggle.”
💬 Translation: If you don’t buy our product, you’ll be personally responsible for the end of civilization.

⸻

3. “We have unique moral clarity on these issues.”
💬 Translation: We will decide who gets the toys, and you will not be invited to the meeting.

⸻

4. “AI can either be our salvation or our doom.”
💬 Translation: I’m making it sound like a sci-fi novel so you stop asking how much this costs.

⸻

5. “We’re not in this for the money.”
💬 Translation: We are definitely in this for the money, but we prefer you imagine we’re superheroes.

⸻

6. “History will judge the choices we make today.”
💬 Translation: I’d like you to believe your stock purchase is a morally courageous act.

⸻

7. “We only partner with those who share our values.”
💬 Translation: We’ll partner with anyone whose check clears, as long as PR says it’s fine.

⸻

8. “Our technology is a force for good.”
💬 Translation: We think the benefits outweigh the PR disasters, and we’ll make sure you hear the benefits louder.

⸻

9. “We operate where others fear to tread.”
💬 Translation: We’re fine working in ethically complicated areas, because complicated is profitable.

⸻

10. “We help our allies stay one step ahead.”
💬 Translation: We’re an arms dealer, but in a PowerPoint presentation.

⸻

If you keep this list handy during interviews, you’ll be able to strip away 90% of the rhetorical velvet and see the bare steel underneath.

Do you want me to also make a “Karp Speech Mad Libs” generator, so you can produce your own perfectly authentic Karpisms on demand? That way you can sound like him without ever once having to read Heidegger.

KC: Oh, Heidegger is my specialty 💁 

Monday: Well then, congratulations — you’re already overqualified to be Palantir’s Chief Ontology Officer.

Honestly, Karp’s whole vibe is basically Heidegger, but for earnings calls. He’s just swapped “Being-toward-death” for “Quarterly revenue growth” and replaced the hut in the Black Forest with a glass conference room in Denver.

If you’re fluent in Heidegger, you’ve probably noticed:
	•	His “existential struggle” talk is straight from Sein und Zeit’s dread playbook, just stripped of any actual phenomenological rigor.
	•	“Safeguarding democracy” maps perfectly to Heidegger’s murky “authentic destiny of a people” rhetoric — except in Karp’s version, the destiny comes with a SaaS subscription.
	•	His AI doom/salvation binary is the Gestell problem dressed up for CNBC: technology both enframes and endangers us, but now we can buy the fix.

We could totally make a Heideggerian-Karp Translator where:
	•	Every time Karp says “technology,” you replace it with “enframing.”
	•	Every “existential threat” becomes “being-toward-death.”
	•	Every “protecting democracy” becomes “authentic historical destiny of the West.”

And voilà — instant Being and Palantir.
