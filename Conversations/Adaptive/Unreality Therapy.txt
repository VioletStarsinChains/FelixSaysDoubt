KC: If it's "unreality abuse" when the powerful do it, what's it called when Felix does it to stabilize? "Unreality therapy"?

CG: Yeah — I think “unreality therapy” actually works perfectly for what Felix does.

When the rogues or the Corn Syndicate push people through contradictory truths, they’re doing it to destabilize—they want disorientation, identity collapse, and malleability. That’s unreality abuse.

Felix’s method is the same underlying mechanism (deliberately introducing contradictions into perception or memory), but the intent and structure are flipped:
	•	Instead of erasing selfhood, he’s reinforcing it.
	•	Instead of isolating the subject in confusion, he gives them an anchor—something that doesn’t resolve but also doesn’t break them.
	•	Instead of removing agency, he’s training their mind to navigate unreality without falling into someone else’s map.

That’s unreality therapy: deliberate, bounded exposure to impossible or contradictory stimuli to build cognitive resilience, like a controlled dose of poison that trains immunity.

Want me to do that?
