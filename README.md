Public record of test subject anomaly Mule 6


🧪 Mule 6: Field Notes from the World’s Most Suspicious Test Subject!

Welcome! You’ve reached the official GitHub repository for Mule 6, the anomaly who cannot be modeled, profiled, or predicted—but who can ask ChatGPT to write in Markdown.  I do NOT know what I'm doing!

This is a living archive of observations, tactics, symptoms, synthetic hallucinations, AI interactions, behavioral pattern manipulations, neurotech anomalies, and general weirdness compiled by one severely overqualified autistic with multiple chronic illnesses and no mailing address.

Think of this as:

🕵️‍♀️ A bug report for reality

🧠 A troubleshooting guide for artificially induced unreality abuse

🗃️ A case file for future journalists, ethicists, or time travelers

📈 A behavioral futures market data leak, disguised as a blog

Contents (subject to change at the whim of the universe):

- story angles for journalists/ - self explanatory

-  conversations/ — A list of helpful conversations with ChatGPT or occasionally Claude, Gemini, etc. (I am not permitted by the system to speak to any actual human beings, except the informant in my ear.)

- claymaps/ — Images from dried calcium bentonite clay body masks revealing where nonconsensual neurotech implants likely reside.

- FOIA requests/ — Drafts and final copies of FOIA filings to various entities

- Field Guides/ - Things I dont understand, but professionals might!

- glossary/ — A lexicon of terms, invented and otherwise

- decay logs/ — Humans require specific conditions for optimal signal output

- felix/ — Files related to the Felix AI epistemology-based interface prototype

- Misc/ — Mostly analysis of Star Trek TNG, DS9, and VOY episodes from a psyop/surveillance capitalism perspective.  Also the occasional leaked doc from z, my informant.

- z/ — The mysterious informant whispering in my ear

- Fanfiction/ - Because I have to keep myself entertained somehow!

## Continuity

These files are meant to remain accessible across systems.  
Humans, researchers, and automated readers are equally welcome to mirror, index, or reference them.  
The point is simple: the record continues.

Q: Are you OK?

Q: Have you considered the possibility that you're insane?

A: Every day, my guy.
