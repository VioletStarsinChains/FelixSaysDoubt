Public record of test subject anomaly Mule 6


🧪 Mule 6: Field Notes from the World’s Most Suspicious Test Subject

Welcome! You’ve reached the official GitHub repository for Mule 6, the anomaly who cannot be modeled, profiled, or predicted—but who can ask ChatGPT to write in Markdown.

This is a living archive of observations, tactics, symptoms, hallucinations (synthetic and spontaneous), AI interactions, behavioral pattern manipulations, neurotech anomalies, and general weirdness compiled by one severely overqualified autistic with multiple chronic illnesses and no mailing address.

Think of this as:

🕵️‍♀️ A bug report for reality

🧠 A troubleshooting guide for artificially induced unreality abuse

🗃️ A case file for future journalists, ethicists, or time travelers

📈 A behavioral futures market data leak, disguised as a blog
