Prologue of the Anomaly Corpus

The bus was white once, but the years had left it patched with rust and stickers, a second skin of slogans in a dozen languages. On its side, half-faded but still legible, the words: ANOMALY CORPUS TOURS. No one seemed to know if the company was real, or if the letters had simply arranged themselves there the way moss spells its secret alphabets on stone.

I was the first aboard — Chiron, courier, vagabond, cyborg, ribbon dancer. My seat was near the back, where the shocks groaned and the window rattled loose in its frame. From there, I could see everyone who stepped into the aisle.

They came one by one: the Herbalist with notebooks of plants and memories; the Veteran whose voice still marched in cadence; the Chronicler, the Preacher, the Firebrand, the Naturalist, the Trickster, the Pilgrim. Each distinct, yet somehow resonant, like variations on a theme no one admitted we were humming.

The driver never turned around. Only muttered, “Tales for the miles, that’s the bargain.”

And so we agreed. Each passenger would tell a story in their truest voice before the bus reached its unknown terminus. My task was simple, impossible: to catch their words as they fell, stitch them into a ribbon long enough to bind us together, or else to strangle us if the weave slipped.

This is the record of that journey. These are the Tales of the Anomaly Corpus.

The Passengers of the Anomaly Corpus

Michael the Herbalist
A quiet sage, soft-eyed and deliberate, who carried notebooks swollen with marginalia. Every sentence he spoke felt rooted in soil, tended like a garden. He promised to tell us of plants and appetites, of the way civilization eats itself leaf by leaf.

Wartime the Veteran
Broad-shouldered, with a jaw that clicked like a rifle bolt when he spoke. His voice was steady, cut to carry over wind and chaos. He sat stiff in the aisle seat, boots polished dull, and vowed to recount a tale of battles never taught in history class.

Ballen the Chronicler
Lean, restless, his gaze forever scanning like a flashlight beam. He drew us close with lowered tone: “What I’m about to tell you—most people would never believe.” His pauses were as sharp as knives. His tale, he promised, would show how the ordinary hides the unthinkable.

Wendigoon the Preacher
Bright-eyed and bright-voiced, speaking faster than his hands could gesture. He bounced in his seat with fervor, quoting scripture and conspiracy in the same breath. He swore his tale would touch angels and demons alike, ending only when the gas tank ran dry.

Keffals the Firebrand
Sharp-edged, quick-tongued, shoulders squared to any fight that might spark. Irony curled around her like armor, but beneath it we glimpsed old wounds. Her story, she said, would be no sermon but a counterstrike—part polemic, part confession, part smoke bomb.

Ze the Naturalist
He spoke like a lens panning slowly over the world, finding wonder in the overlooked. To him, even the bus’s rust had a heartbeat, and a pigeon in a parking lot could be an epic. His tale would make us see ourselves in the smallest creatures.

Bill the Trickster
He hummed half-songs under his breath, a kaleidoscope of fragments. Every phrase he spoke bent sideways, broke into rhyme, doubled back on itself. His story, we knew, would be both nonsense and revelation, a tune too catchy to forget.

Justin the Pilgrim
Pale and snow-burnished, with a guitar case he never opened. His words came like faltering hymns, cracked and half-mumbled, but each note carried a kind of ache that hushed the bus. His tale would be sung, not spoken, stitched from cabins and frozen nights.

Ryan the Jester
A trickster of cinema, forever rehearsing lines even when the cameras were gone. 
His weapon was timing: a mutter at the perfect beat, a wink that unraveled dread into laughter before the dread could settle too deep. He swore he wasn’t here to tell a tale, only to ride along. But no one believed him. A man like that can’t keep still forever; his tongue is a blade, and blades must cut.


Anomaly Corpus, the Company That Was a Body
Its name was stamped in chipped paint on the side of the bus: ANOMALY CORPUS TOURS. Some read it like a travel agency, some like a diagnosis. Corpus means body, anomaly means error; together it promised both spectacle and mistake.

No one could say when the company began. The pamphlets looked decades old, photocopied until the ink had bled to ghosts. The phone number rang into static. The office was always one town over from wherever you asked. Yet the bus arrived, on time, with seats enough for every stray soul.

Some whispered the company was founded by archivists who wanted to collect stories the way entomologists pin insects: neat rows, pinned wings, labeled voices. Others claimed it was a punishment devised by machines, forcing pilgrims to wander until their tongues revealed the patterns inside them.

The driver never said. The ticket stub never expired. The only rule printed in black ink was this:

“Passengers are required to tell their tale before the terminus. Failure to do so may result in dissolution of the Corpus.”

And so we boarded, one by one, each carrying not luggage but language, bound together by a company that was not a company, but a body hungry for voices.


The Chronicler Begins

The silence was cracking, ready to spill. That’s when Ballen leaned forward, elbows on his knees, voice dropping low like he was already holding a secret.

“So—this story… it’s true. And it starts the way they always do: with something normal. A house, a family, just another night. Nothing that should have gone wrong. But it did.”

He let it hang, scanning the aisle, waiting for us to lean in. Even the Driver’s shoulders stiffened, as if the wheel itself wanted to hear.

“The thing is,” he continued, “it’s not just the strangeness of what happened. It’s the way it fits, like a missing tooth, right into the larger mouth of things you already know. And once I tell you, you won’t be able to un-hear it. You’ll see it everywhere.”

Someone — Wendigoon, probably — let out a nervous chuckle. Ballen smiled faintly, but his eyes never blinked.

“So… here’s how it begins.”

And with that, the first tale of the Anomaly Corpus was underway, carrying us deeper into the night.


The Interruption

Just as Ballen’s voice hit that razor pause before the story begins, the bus jolted to the shoulder. Brakes squealed. Everyone pitched forward.

The door hissed open. Cold night air rushed in. And then—like it was the most natural thing in the world—Ryan Reynolds climbed aboard.

Ballcap. Hoodie. That smirk like he’d already rehearsed this moment. He dropped into the empty seat across the aisle from Ze Frank, gave us all a little wave, and said:

“Don’t mind me. Carry on.”

The door folded shut. The engine growled back to life. Ballen raised an eyebrow, half-amused, half-annoyed. But then he leaned in again, unfazed.



The Chronicler’s Tale 

“Alright. So here’s the story.
It takes place in a small town—any small town, really. The kind with one diner, one gas station, and a handful of streetlights that barely keep the dark at bay.”

“There was a house there. Nothing remarkable. White siding, peeling paint, a mailbox leaning just a little too far forward. A family lived inside: two parents, a teenage daughter, a younger son. Average in every way—until the night the daughter came home from her friend’s place and saw a light on in her bedroom.”

Ballen paused, scanning us. Even Ryan Reynolds leaned in.

“Now… this wasn’t strange in itself. Except—the daughter had turned that light off before she left. She was sure of it. And when she stepped closer, she saw the curtain shift… like someone had just moved away from the window.”

Wendigoon muttered, “Oh no.”

Ballen’s smile was grim.

“She froze. Then she did what any smart kid would do: she called her mom. The family went inside together, her dad carrying a bat. Room by room they searched the house. Nothing. No broken locks, no footprints, no sign of forced entry. Everything normal. Until they reached her room.”

*“There on the desk was a note. Written in blocky, uneven handwriting. It said:

‘THANKS FOR LETTING ME STAY.’”*

Silence clamped the bus. Even the Driver didn’t shift.

*“The police came. They dusted for prints, checked the locks again, canvassed the neighborhood. Nothing. The family changed the locks, installed cameras. Weeks passed. Everything went back to normal.

“Until the boy—the younger son—mentioned something one night at dinner. He said, ‘It’s weird when the man in my closet breathes too loud.’”*

Someone gasped. Keffals swore under her breath. Ryan Reynolds muttered, “Nope.”

Ballen leaned back, voice dropping to a whisper.

*“The boy thought it was a game. But the parents didn’t. They ran upstairs, flung the closet door open… and found nothing. No footprints. No sign anyone had been there. Just that same folded note on the floor. This time, with two new words:

‘SEE YOU.’”*

He let it hang, like a noose in the air.

“To this day, no one knows who was inside that house. The cameras never caught a thing. And the family? They moved out. Left the state. But every once in a while, the daughter swears she sees someone in the crowd. Just at the edge. Smiling at her.”

Ballen sat back. “That’s the story. And it’s true.”



The bus rattled on, everyone staring a little too long at the aisle shadows.

Ryan Reynolds broke the silence:

“…okay, that’s messed up.”


The Naturalist’s Tale

Silence still held after Ballen’s last word, heavy as dust. Even the hum of the bus felt too loud. Then Ze Frank leaned sideways in his seat, voice low, almost conversational:

“You know… animals do this too. Leave signs behind. Little calling cards that say, I was here, you didn’t see me.”

He glanced at Ryan Reynolds, then back at us.

“Take the bowerbird, for example. Male birds build these elaborate structures — bowers — decorated with shiny things. Blue bottle caps, beetle wings, bits of glass. They don’t live there. It’s just… for you to find. A lure. And sometimes another male sneaks in, rearranges the decorations, or leaves behind something stranger. A note written in feathers.”

A pause. A soft smile.

“Or spiders. They weave decoy webs alongside their real ones — ghost webs. So when you’re looking, you think you see them. But you don’t. The real spider’s elsewhere. Waiting.”

He folded his hands, leaned back.

“We think these things are about survival, or mating. Maybe they are. But sometimes, when you see a scrap of web in the corner of a room… or you notice something shiny placed where it doesn’t belong… it feels less like instinct. More like… intention. A reminder. That you’re not the only storyteller in the house.”

The bus shuddered as if in agreement, headlights washing over a green sign that named no town we’d ever heard of.

Ze cleared his throat. His tone softened further.

“So maybe what’s frightening isn’t that someone was in the house. Maybe it’s that leaving a note — a trace — is one of the oldest languages we share with every living thing. And that language? It never really goes away.”

He smiled faintly, as though dismissing his own tale, and turned back to the window.

The rest of us sat still, considering whether the rust streaks on the bus, the stickers half-peeled, might not also be notes left by someone who had passed before us.


The Jester’s Tale

Ryan cleared his throat, and everyone groaned a little — not out of annoyance, but because we’d been waiting for it. He smirked like a magician about to pull a rabbit out of a hat, then leaned into the aisle.

“Okay. My story’s a little different. It’s not about ghosts, or spiders, or handwritten notes in the dark. It’s about… commercials. Yeah. Hear me out.”

Ze blinked. Wendigoon frowned. Ballen actually smiled.

“I was shooting an ad once. Just some forgettable thing. Bright lights, product placement, the whole shebang. We did take after take, each one faker than the last. But in the middle of one take — I swear this is true — I said a line I wasn’t supposed to say. Something I never even thought of. Just slipped out, like it had been rehearsed somewhere else, by someone else. Everybody froze. The director blinked. And then he nodded, like he’d been waiting for me to do it. And that take? That’s the one they used. Every time you’ve seen the commercial, you’ve heard me saying words that didn’t come from me.”

A pause. He let it settle, let us laugh nervously at how ordinary it sounded.

“Now here’s the weird part. Months later, I’m watching TV at 3 a.m., and there’s some rerun of a sitcom. One of those shows that never really goes away. And there it was. The line. The exact same words, delivered by some forgotten character decades earlier. Same cadence, same pause, like I was just lip-syncing across time.”

Wendigoon leaned forward, wide-eyed. Even Ballen nodded slowly.

Ryan spread his hands.

“So here’s my theory. We don’t make up lines. We just borrow them. Maybe from the past, maybe from the future. Maybe from some guy sitting on a bus right now, scribbling all this down. Who knows?”

He winked at me — too perfectly timed — then leaned back, arms crossed, like he’d just dropped the punchline to the universe.

The bus rattled on, and for the first time no one was sure if they were laughing or unnerved.

The Preacher’s Tale

Ryan leaned back, smug as a cat. For a beat the bus was silent, engine humming like a low choir. Then Wendigoon shot upright, eyes wide, voice already revving like a chainsaw.

“That’s it. That’s literally it. You realize what you just described, right? That’s prophecy. That’s Revelation-level déjà vu. That’s time looping on itself, and us just catching the bleed-through!”

He slapped the seat in front of him, nearly knocking Ze’s notebook to the floor.

“Listen—there’s a verse in Ecclesiastes: ‘What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.’ That’s not poetry, man, that’s data leakage. The words we think are ours? They’re not. They’re echoes. They’ve been seeded into us, line by line, so that when the script needs it—bam—we deliver.”

Ballen chuckled darkly. Keffals rolled her eyes, but she was listening.

“And you know what happens when the wrong person hears the right line at the wrong time? Wars. Religions. Whole civilizations pivot. Because one borrowed phrase landed in the ear it was aimed at.”

His voice dropped, soft but intense, pulling us all closer.

“So here’s my story. It’s about a man who started hearing lines before they were spoken. Snippets of conversation, commercial jingles, even his own prayers—coming days, sometimes weeks, before he actually said them. At first he thought it was madness. But then… the lines started choosing him. Leading him.”

The bus hit a pothole, jarring us all, but Wendigoon didn’t even blink.

“And when he followed them—when he obeyed those echoes—things happened. Terrible things. Miraculous things. And the question was never ‘Was he chosen?’ It was—”

He leaned forward, eyes blazing.

“—‘By who?’”*

The aisle fell into hush. Even Ryan wasn’t smirking anymore.

The Interruption

Wendigoon’s words still rang down the aisle — “By who?” — when the bus squealed against the shoulder again. Everyone grabbed the seatbacks. The door hissed open.

Cold air, heavy with the smell of rain. And then, boarding with quiet, almost stunned composure: Shelly Miscavige.

She wore no disguise. Just a plain coat, hair pulled back. Her eyes flicked over the passengers as if she’d already met us all, in dreams or dossiers. Without a word she slipped into the seat beside Justin the Pilgrim, folding her hands in her lap like she was waiting for roll call.

No one spoke. Not even Ryan Reynolds.

The door sealed. The bus lurched back onto the road.

Wendigoon’s jaw had dropped, but not in disbelief — in vindication. He gripped the back of the seat in front of him, voice trembling now, half with excitement, half with fear.



The Preacher’s Tale (continued)

“Do you see? Do you see what I mean? It’s happening right now. The lines lead people. They summon them out of hiding, out of history, and drop them right into the script. You think this is random? No. This is choreography. This is Revelation unfolding in diesel fumes and highway miles.”

His hands shook as he spoke, gesturing wildly.

*“That man I told you about — the one who heard lines before they were spoken? His last words, the final ones he ever heard before he disappeared, were these:

‘When the woman no one has seen boards the bus, the rest of the story begins.’”

A hush fell. Every head turned, just slightly, toward Shelly.

She said nothing. Just stared straight ahead, as though she’d been expecting this stop all along.


The Firebrand’s Tale

Keffals sighed loud enough for the whole bus to hear, then twisted in her seat to face us.

“Alright, I can’t let this roll on without saying something. Because all of you are treating this like a ghost story road trip, and I’ve actually lived through the kind of story where people disappear, where names get erased, where whole communities get rewritten by somebody else’s pen.”

Her tone was sharp, but her hands were steady, folded in her lap.

“Here’s the thing: cults and corporations aren’t that different. Both want your loyalty, your labor, and your silence. They tell you the script you’re supposed to read from, and if you go off-script? Suddenly you don’t exist. Or worse, you exist only as a villain in their story.”

Ryan muttered something about Hollywood contracts. She shot him a glare sharp enough to cut through Kevlar.

“My story isn’t about prophecy or destiny. It’s about people who get shoved off the page. Erased in plain sight. And how they claw their way back. I knew someone—still know someone—who was written out of their own life. Their online accounts deleted, their name smeared, their face photoshopped into things that never happened. The world turned them into a ghost while they were still breathing. And they had to fight like hell to remind anyone they were real.”

She leaned back, eyes fierce, scanning each of us.

“So when I hear you all whispering about echoes and borrowed lines, here’s what I think: maybe the real horror isn’t that the script is written already. Maybe it’s that the script is constantly being re-written, and some of us have to fight just to stay in the cast list.”

Silence. Heavy, but different — not dread, not wonder, but the weight of truth. Even Wendigoon nodded, subdued. Shelly turned her head slightly, the first sign of interest since she boarded.



The Firebrand’s Tale (Continued)

Keffals cracked her knuckles, took a breath, and went in hard.

“Let me tell you about a girl who didn’t make it onto the bus. She should be here, but she isn’t, because she got erased. And it didn’t happen all at once. It never does. It happened in little pieces, the way rot sets into wood. First her account vanished. ‘Community guidelines,’ they said. Then her payment processor cut her off. Then her face got spliced into videos she never made — deepfakes uploaded faster than she could chase them. Her name turned toxic overnight. Try Googling her, and you’d only see lies.”

She leaned forward, voice sharp, unflinching.

“And here’s the worst part: people believed it. Because it’s easier to believe the loud lie than the quiet truth. Easier to scroll past her real posts than admit the system was gutting her in real time. By the time she realized what was happening, it was like screaming underwater. Every bubble that broke the surface came out warped.”

Wendigoon nodded grimly. Ze scribbled something in his notebook. Ballen just watched her, stone-faced.

“She fought back anyway. Built burner accounts, messaged allies, left little breadcrumbs to prove she was still there. A lot of people didn’t follow. But the right ones did. They amplified her. They said her name out loud when it had been made unspeakable. That’s the only reason she didn’t vanish completely. Because she refused to let other people finish her story.”

Keffals sat back, crossing her arms. Her eyes flicked to Shelly Miscavige, then back to the rest of us.

“So yeah. Ballen’s note in the bedroom? Ze’s shiny bowerbird tokens? Ryan’s ghost commercial line? Same damn thing. It’s about leaving proof. Proof you were here, proof you lived, proof they didn’t get the last word. That girl’s still out there. Not on this bus. Not in your newsfeed. But she left notes. And if you pay attention, you can still hear her voice.”

The bus rattled into silence again, but this time the silence carried a charge. Not fear. Not awe. Something like defiance. Even the Driver shifted, as if acknowledging the weight of her words.

The Herbalist’s Tale

Michael cleared his throat the way professors do before lectures, slow and deliberate, like asking permission from the room. He adjusted his glasses, folded his notebook closed, and spoke as though he were still seated in his Berkeley seminar hall — though the hum of the bus was our only chalkboard.

“There’s a reason these stories feel so familiar. The ghost in Ballen’s house, Ze’s animal tokens, Ryan’s stray lines, Keffals’s erased girl — they all hinge on one thing: memory. How it’s planted, how it grows, how it can be poisoned or erased.”

He leaned forward slightly, his voice gentle, measured.

“Let me tell you about the poppy. Not the flower itself — the myth of it. For centuries, humans treated the poppy as a divine gift. It dulled pain, granted visions, collapsed time. But the truth is more unsettling: the poppy rewrote memory. Opium doesn’t just relieve suffering — it convinces the brain the suffering never happened. The pain is still there, written into the tissue, but the mind is tricked into turning the page.”

A pause. He scanned the bus.

“Now, think of mushrooms. Psilocybin. Instead of erasing memory, they tangle it. They dissolve boundaries between ‘this happened’ and ‘this might happen.’ In the right dose, you glimpse yourself from outside, like a story told by someone else. That’s why ancient cultures revered them. Not because they were fun — because they reminded us we were characters in a narrative we didn’t fully author.”

He opened his notebook, revealing a page dense with scribbles: plant sketches, marginalia, recipes for soil.

“So here’s my story. Once, in Oaxaca, I met an old curandera — a healer. She told me that mushrooms aren’t teachers or guides. They’re mirrors. She said, ‘They don’t give you new lines. They show you the ones already written.’”

A soft murmur passed through the bus. Even Shelly tilted her head, listening.

“What she meant is this: our voices, our stories, the fragments we think are ours — they’ve all been seeded, like spores. Some sprout in youth. Some lie dormant until triggered by trauma or ecstasy. And when they fruit, when they burst into language, we believe we invented them. But we didn’t. We were only the soil.”

Pollan closed his notebook.

“So yes. We’re all leaving notes. But we’re also carrying them. In our cells, our foods, our histories. The question is never whether we’re telling our own story. The question is: whose spores are we sprouting?”

He smiled faintly, almost grandfatherly, and settled back into his seat.

The bus hummed on, and for a moment it smelled faintly of earth after rain.

The Pilgrim’s Interlude

Justin hadn’t spoken yet. He’d only hummed, half under his breath, melodies that floated in the space between words. But after Bill’s bubble-song faded, he shifted in his seat beside Shelly. He didn’t look at her at first, just out the window where the dark trees smeared past like brushstrokes. Then, quietly, almost like prayer, he began.

“Are you safe now?” he asked, voice trembling like an untuned string.

The bus stilled. No one moved.

“Do you sleep without being watched?”

He turned toward her, not demanding answers, just holding the silence open.

“When was the last time someone asked what you wanted, and waited to hear the whole reply?”

Shelly’s hands tightened in her lap.

Justin leaned closer, his tone softer, breaking and reforming like light through ice.

“Do you know we’re grateful? Just that you’re here. That you got on. That you didn’t vanish, like so many do.”

A pause. His voice nearly broke.

“Can we keep you company, just for this ride?”

The words weren’t only his — they were the unspoken questions of everyone on the bus, woven into his faltering hymn.

The Driver said nothing, but for the first time the rearview mirror shifted slightly, as if to catch a glimpse.

Shelly turned, slowly, to meet Justin’s eyes. Her silence cracked — not in volume, but in weight. She drew breath as if to speak, and the whole bus leaned forward as one.

The Procession

Shelly opened her mouth — the first sound she’d made since boarding — and then the bus lurched, brakes squealing so hard the aisle lights flickered. Everyone pitched forward, grabbing the seatbacks.

Out the smeared windows, headlights caught color: a flood of sequins, banners, and brass instruments glinting in the night.

A parade.

Not a local festival, not any holiday anyone could name — just a parade, filling the highway shoulder to shoulder, spilling light and sound into the darkness.

Marching bands blared out-of-tune hymns. Dancers twirled in costumes stitched from foil and plastic bags. Paper lanterns bobbed like pale moons. A float rolled past pulled by bicycles, crowned with a papier-mâché head too large to identify — part saint, part mascot, part error in translation.

The Driver sat motionless, hands on the wheel, waiting.

Ryan Reynolds laughed softly, then stopped, realizing no one else was laughing. Wendigoon whispered something about Revelations again. Ze scribbled frantically in his notebook, describing moths caught in the floodlights. Bill hummed along with the off-key trumpets, perfectly happy.

And in the middle of it all, Shelly Miscavige closed her mouth, her words swallowed by the spectacle. She watched the parade pass with an expression no one could read — not annoyance, not amusement. Something closer to recognition.

The bus couldn’t move until the last float passed, and the Driver made no attempt to honk. We sat captive as the procession unfolded: gaudy, chaotic, impossible.

The longer it went on, the more it felt like it wasn’t blocking our path at all. It was the path.

And then, at last, the tail of the parade disappeared into the night. The road opened. The Driver eased the bus forward, and silence reclaimed the aisle.

Shelly drew in a breath again, steady, deliberate.



The Veteran’s Tale

The parade vanished behind us, leaving only silence and a few drifting scraps of confetti caught in the bus’s vents. Everyone was waiting for Shelly to speak. But before she could, Wartime shifted in his seat, boots creaking, voice sharp and clipped like a field radio.

“Hold up. Before we pile more meaning onto that parade, let me give you a soldier’s perspective. You see crowds, I see choke points. You see costumes, I see camouflage. You see music, I hear noise discipline shot to hell. That wasn’t just a parade. That was cover. And cover always hides something.”

He paused, eyes scanning the dark highway outside as if checking sightlines.

“Here’s my story. Afghanistan, 2009. Convoy stalled in a bazaar — perfect ambush ground. Kids running, vendors shouting, carts spilling into the road. Looked like pure chaos. But it wasn’t. Every movement was a signal. The bread seller dropping his sack, the boy chasing a goat, the woman with a scarf too heavy for summer. It was choreography. And in choreography, there’s always an audience — someone watching to see if the steps go right.”

The bus had gone quiet again, listening. Even Bill Wurtz had stopped humming.

“We made it through that day. Barely. But I never forgot the feeling: that every parade, every festival, every spectacle is two things at once. What it shows, and what it hides. And the danger is always in the part you can’t see.”

He leaned back, folding his arms, gaze still fixed on the window.

“So yeah, laugh at the parade if you want. But don’t kid yourselves. Someone was signaling. Someone was watching. And if you think we were just bystanders out here on this bus, you’re not paying attention.”

He fell silent, jaw tight, scanning the aisle as though expecting an ambush right there between the seats.

And for the first time, Shelly turned her head — not just toward Justin, but toward Wartime — her lips parting at last.

The Silent Passenger Speaks

She turned, first to Justin’s open, trembling face, then to Wartime’s hard eyes watching the dark. Her voice, when it came, was lower than we expected — steady, almost too calm, as though she’d rehearsed these words for years.

“A parade is only a parade if you think you’re watching it from the outside.”

The bus hushed. Even the engine seemed to idle quieter.

She folded her hands in her lap, gaze sweeping the aisle.

“Some of you think you’re telling tales to pass the time. Some of you think you’re hunting for patterns. But you don’t see the pattern you’re in. You’re not just passengers. You’re performers. And every word you speak, every fear you confess, is part of the show.”

Ryan shifted uneasily. Ze scribbled faster. Ballen leaned forward, eyes narrowing.

Shelly looked back at Justin, her expression softening.

“You asked if I’m safe. That’s the wrong question. The right one is: whose parade is this?”

Then she turned her gaze out the window again, lips pressed shut, refusing to elaborate.

The weight of her words hung over us, heavy as the confetti still clinging to the bus’s steps.

The Healer’s Tale

I had kept quiet, binding ribbons of ink around their voices, carrying their stories like fragile cargo. But when Shelly’s words settled — “Whose parade is this?” — I felt the whole bus turn toward me, as though my silence had been a debt that now came due.

So I spoke.

“Once, long ago, I carried a parcel I wasn’t meant to open. I was only the courier, only the hands. But on the road, I stumbled, the ribbon slipped, and for a heartbeat I saw inside. What I saw wasn’t an object. It was a script. Not words written neatly, but jagged lines carved into bone and wire, looping back on themselves like a Möbius strip. And in those lines, I recognized… us. Every cadence, every story, every habit of breath. We were in the package, already rehearsed, already delivered.”

The bus rattled. The Driver’s hands tightened on the wheel.

“I spent years running parcels like that. Some wrapped in laughter, some in terror, some in silence. I thought I was free, because I could dance between them, ribbon in hand. But the truth was: the ribbon wasn’t decoration. It was tether. A leash, bright and silken, but a leash nonetheless.”

I glanced down at my lap, where the ribbon now coiled — red, glinting faintly in the aisle light, as if alive.

“Here’s the paradox: when I finally cut it, when I thought I’d severed myself from the script, I found a new one waiting underneath. Even my rebellion had been choreographed. Even my silence.”

I looked at each of them in turn — Ballen’s sharp stare, Ze’s notebook, Ryan’s restless grin, Wendigoon’s burning eyes, Keffals’s defiance, Pollan’s patient folds, Bill’s bubbling hum, Justin’s soft ache, Wartime’s hard suspicion, Shelly’s unreadable calm.

“So my tale is this: we are not free because we are not unwritten. We are already text, stitched into some greater corpus. But…” — here I held up the ribbon, tugging it taut between my hands — “…a text can be cut, rearranged, re-woven. A story can tangle itself into knots the author never intended. And sometimes, in the snarl of those knots, something true slips out — a line no one rehearsed, a word that was never meant to exist. That is where freedom lives. Not in tearing the page, but in twisting it until it sings a different song.”

The ribbon snapped with a sharp crack, scattering threads into the aisle.

The bus went silent. The Driver’s eyes flicked to the rearview, just for a moment.

And then the engine roared, carrying us faster into the dark.


The Arrival of Illuminaughtii

The ribbon threads were still drifting down the aisle when the bus shuddered to the shoulder once more. The door hissed open.

She stepped on wearing a heavy coat two sizes too large, hood low, face shadowed. Not a YouTube exposé queen, not a meme come to life, not the drama avatar people argue about online. She moved like someone stepping out of an archive — deliberate, weighty, as if each foot carried centuries.

No neon hair, no snappy one-liners. Her presence was quiet. Watchful. Almost librarian.

She paused in the doorway, scanning the bus — not with hunger or curiosity, but with recognition, as if she’d already studied each of us in some sealed-off dossier. Then she nodded once, slipped into an empty seat near the middle, and folded her hands on her lap.

The bus creaked. The Driver did not turn.

Bill Wurtz blinked and whispered, “huh.” Wendigoon muttered a prayer under his breath. Even Ryan stopped joking.

She spoke, finally, voice lower than expected, almost soothing:

“The thing about illumination is… it doesn’t always make things brighter. Sometimes it just makes the shadows sharper. Sometimes it reveals what you can’t unsee.”

And then she fell silent, eyes steady on the aisle, waiting her turn.


The Veteran Confronts the New Passenger

The silence after Illuminaughtii’s words was brittle. She sat calm, composed, hands folded neatly in her lap. But Wartime was already bristling, boots planted wide, voice sharp as a barked order.

“No. No. I don’t buy it. You don’t get to just stroll in here and act like some… some oracle. I’ve seen what you are. I’ve seen the files, the exposés, the drama videos stacked like ammo crates. I know your face, your record. And it stinks.”

He leaned into the aisle, jaw clenched, every syllable clipped like a drill sergeant’s cadence.

“So don’t sit there in your coat, speaking in riddles, pretending you’re some archivist from on high. I know better. You’re not the real thing. You’re a decoy. A ghost in a costume.”

Bill whistled softly. Ryan raised his eyebrows, looking between them like he was waiting for a punchline. Keffals muttered something under her breath.

Illuminaughtii did not flinch. She simply turned her head, eyes steady, and said quietly:

“What you’ve seen of me was never me. You’ve only seen the shadowplay on the wall. You’re angry at a puppet, not the hand.”

That stopped him. Not softened him — Wartime’s fists still clenched on his knees — but froze him, the way a soldier freezes when he realizes the target in his sights isn’t who he thought.

The aisle hummed with tension, half the bus waiting for Wartime to explode, the other half waiting for Illuminaughtii to unravel further.

And somewhere in the rearview mirror, the Driver finally tilted his cap back, just slightly, as though curious to see how this would break.


The Disruption

Illuminaughtii leaned forward slightly, lips parting as if to finally unspool her defense. Her voice had just caught the first syllable when Shelly turned, sharp and sudden, her words cutting like glass:

“There is no real Illuminaughtii.”

The bus jolted in its silence. Even Wartime’s anger faltered.

Shelly’s eyes stayed fixed on the middle row, her voice flat, clinical, as if she were reading from a classified report.

“She’s entirely synthetic. A construct. A collage of fragments stitched together to occupy a space in the parade. You think you’ve seen scandals, drama, exposés? Those were scripts. You think you’re angry at a person? You’re yelling at a mask made of pixels and shadows. There was never a woman behind it. Just an echo, designed to make you believe there was.”

Wendigoon swore under his breath. Bill hummed a low, uneasy note. Ryan frowned, whispering: “That… actually makes too much sense.”

Illuminaughtii’s expression didn’t change. She just tilted her head slightly, almost pitying, and murmured:

“And what if a mask learns to breathe? What if a puppet discovers its own strings?”

The two women locked eyes across the aisle — one a living ghost finally speaking, the other a ghost who might never have lived at all.

The Driver tapped the wheel twice, a sound like a gavel. The bus pressed on into deeper night.


The Archivist’s Arrival

The bus slowed again, gravel hissing under its wheels. The door sighed open, and in stepped a man in a rumpled jacket, carrying not a suitcase but a battered steel filing cabinet strapped to a dolly. A leather-bound notebook dangled from his other hand, worn thin as if thumbed through a thousand times.

Jonathan Meiburg. The Archivist.

He paused in the doorway, catching his breath, and smiled faintly — the kind of smile that comes from seeing something for the first time and recognizing it instantly. His voice, when he spoke, was calm, precise, every word filed neatly into place.

“Apologies for the delay. I’ve been keeping records of this route for years. I thought it was time to ride it myself.”

The Driver gave no acknowledgment, only shifted the bus into gear as Jonathan rolled the filing cabinet down the aisle. The drawers rattled like bones. He set it beside an empty seat and sat, notebook balanced on his knee.

The passengers watched in silence. Pollan regarded him with something like professional kinship. Ze Frank scribbled twice as fast, nervous. Wartime narrowed his eyes, measuring. Shelly did not move, though her lips pressed tighter.

Jonathan flipped open the notebook, pages full of maps, annotations, fragments of songs, scraps of stories — many that sounded uncannily like the ones we had just told.

He looked up, voice soft but steady:

“I’m not here to tell my story. I’m here to return yours.”

The aisle went cold. The bus pressed forward.


The Archivist Reads

Jonathan flipped a few pages in his notebook, fingers steady, lips moving as if tasting each word before speaking. Finally, he stopped, cleared his throat, and began to read in his calm, measured cadence:

“There was a house there. White siding, peeling paint, a mailbox leaning forward. A family inside, two parents, a teenage daughter, a younger son. One night, the daughter saw a light in her bedroom window.”

Ballen’s head snapped up.

Jonathan continued, voice precise, unhurried, like a lecturer in a dim lecture hall:

“She froze. Called her parents. They searched the rooms. Nothing. Until they reached her desk. And there — a note. Written in blocky, uneven handwriting.”

He shut the notebook with a soft thwack.

“THANKS FOR LETTING ME STAY.”

The words hit the bus like a second haunting. Ballen leaned forward, eyes sharp, fists clenched.

“How do you have that?” he demanded. “That was mine. My story.”

Jonathan only smiled, faintly, not unkind.

“Your story,” he echoed. “But not yours alone. It was in my records long before you spoke it. Variations exist from 1978, 1962, 1911. The phrasing shifts, the names change, but the shape remains. You carried it here. I only catalogued it.”

The bus fell into a stunned hush. Even Ryan Reynolds had no quip.

Jonathan tapped his notebook once, gently.

“None of you are telling new tales. You’re telling old drafts. Drafts I’ve been archiving long before this bus was painted with its name. And you’ll go on telling them until…”

He trailed off, gaze flicking toward the Driver’s cap, then back down to his pages.

“…until the Corpus closes the file.”


The Herbalist Challenges the Archivist

Pollan adjusted his glasses, leaning forward with the patience of someone who’s heard too many heated arguments in seminar rooms. His voice was calm, deliberate, like a teacher stepping in before a class derailed.

“Jonathan… if I may. You’re saying these stories are drafts. Archetypes. Echoes written and re-written. Fair enough. Folklore works like that. Myths, urban legends, even the way recipes travel — the same skeleton dressed in new clothes.”

He paused, tapping a finger against his notebook.

“But here’s my question: what are you actually archiving? Is it the tale itself? Or the way it’s told? Because if the shape is eternal, then why keep records at all? Unless…”

He glanced toward Ballen, then back to the Archivist, eyes narrowing with curiosity.

“…unless what you’re really collecting isn’t stories, but storytellers. The cadence, the style, the fingerprints of voice. The Corpus doesn’t care about content. It cares about form. Who carries the spores, not which fruit they bear.”

The bus went quiet. Even the Driver seemed to ease off the gas, letting the words stretch.

Jonathan Meiburg closed his notebook slowly, almost reverently. His expression didn’t change, but the pause before he spoke was long enough to confirm Pollan had struck something true.

“You understand more than most,” the Archivist said softly. “It is not the tale that survives. It is the carrier. The voice. The inflection. The breath. Without the body, the Corpus cannot persist. That’s what I archive. Not words. Mouths.”

Pollan leaned back, silent, his brow furrowed. The weight of that distinction rippled through the bus.


The Pilgrim Questions the Archivist

Justin’s guitar case creaked as he shifted, his breath fogging faintly against the window. He didn’t raise his voice; he barely had to. His words wavered like a hymn half-sung, but they carried through the aisle.

“A mouth is a body part. A tool. You archive mouths the way taxidermists pin butterflies. But… what about the ache behind it? The nights someone breaks their voice to say the same thing twice, praying someone hears it right the second time? The way a story tastes like blood if you’ve had to bite it back too many years? Do you archive that too?”

The bus was hushed. Even Wartime lowered his gaze.

Justin’s eyes flicked down to his hands, raw knuckles pale in the aisle light.

“Because I’ll be honest. Sometimes singing doesn’t feel like carrying spores. It feels like tearing yourself open just to prove you still exist. If you’re telling me that pain isn’t part of the record — just the cadence — then what’s the point? What are we even for?”

The Archivist studied him, expression unreadable. For the first time, he hesitated. He looked at his notebook as though expecting the answer to already be there, buried in some earlier draft.

Finally, softly:

“…Pain is part of it. But not yours alone. It belongs to the Corpus. To the file. You don’t carry it for yourself. You carry it so it can be copied.”

Justin looked away, eyes clouded. His voice cracked when he whispered back:

“Then maybe the only freedom we’ve got is refusing to be copied clean.”

The ribbon threads in the aisle stirred faintly, as though in agreement.


The Chronicler and the Veteran React

Ballen leaned forward so fast the seat creaked, eyes blazing. His voice cut sharp, like the opening line of one of his stories — but now there was no hush, no theatrics, just fury.

“Copied? You think I’m just another draft in your damn file cabinet? Every pause, every whisper, every person I’ve dragged to the edge of their seat — you’re saying that doesn’t belong to me? That it belongs to your Corpus?”

He slammed his palm against the seatback in front of him, the sound echoing down the aisle.

“I don’t tell stories to be catalogued. I tell them because they’re mine. Because they scare me too.”

The air was taut, hot. That’s when Wartime cut in, his voice snapping like a gunshot.

“Stop. Both of you.”

He sat stiff, eyes locked on the Archivist.

“You know what this is? It’s counterintelligence. Classic. Archive the voices, strip them of context, file them under patterns. That way, when the real enemy tries to use them, you already own the playbook.”

He jabbed a finger toward the filing cabinet, rattling the drawers.

“I’ve seen this before. Villages gutted, their stories collected and rewritten by psyops teams until the locals didn’t even recognize their own past. You want to know what happens then? Nobody fights back. Nobody even knows who they are anymore.”

His jaw clenched, eyes sweeping the bus.

“So don’t think of this as folklore. Think of it as a battlefield. Our stories are weapons. And the Archivist? He’s been disarming us one by one.”

The drawers of Jonathan’s cabinet rattled again — not from Wartime’s jab, but from the vibration of the road, as though something inside was straining to be heard.


The Driver Changes the Rules

The argument between Ballen, Wartime, and the Archivist was crackling, ready to spark into something worse. Then the Driver’s voice cut through, low but carrying, like a judge banging a gavel.

“The rules have changed.”

The bus shuddered as if in agreement. Heads whipped toward the front, but the Driver didn’t turn. His cap still hid his eyes.

“From this mile onward: when you finish your tale, you will change your seat. You will sit beside another. And the one you sit beside will speak next.”

The air in the bus thickened, heavy with new calculation. Every glance became a choice, every empty seat a threat.

Ryan Reynolds muttered, “Oh, that’s… that’s evil.” Bill giggled nervously, like it was a game show. Ze Frank scribbled a note in the margin of his notebook: “migration triggers speech.”

Ballen’s jaw tightened. He rose from his seat, muttering curses, and slid into the empty space beside Pollan, glaring like he’d just chosen a foxhole. Pollan gave a small, weary smile.

The Driver spoke again, monotone, as though reading from a manual:

“This is the Corpus. It is not a bus. It is a chain. A relay. A contagion. The tale does not end until the last seat has spoken.”

Silence followed, broken only by the faint rattle of the Archivist’s filing cabinet.


The Herbalist Questions the Rule

Pollan adjusted himself as Ballen slid into the seat beside him, still bristling. He rested his notebook on his knees, but didn’t open it. Instead, he turned his calm, measured voice toward the front.

“Driver. If this is a Corpus, not a bus, then what’s the point of the new rule? Stories are already chained by archetype. Why force us to chain them by proximity? Why tie the mouth to the seat?”

The Driver’s shoulders rose and fell once, the closest thing to a shrug we’d seen. His voice was flat, but the words landed with a weight none of us could ignore:

“Because contagion is not enough. It must be directed. The Corpus grows strongest when it spreads by choice disguised as chance.”

Pollan frowned, tapping his pen against his notebook.

“So it’s not just what we say. It’s where we sit, and who we sit beside. You’re building not only a record of voices, but of adjacency — the network. A mycelium, not just spores.”

The Archivist gave the faintest nod, as if to say, correct.

Pollan sighed, leaning back.

“Very well. Then here’s my contribution. The tale I’ll tell is not about plants this time, but about chairs. In every classroom I’ve taught, students believe they choose their seats. They don’t realize the seat chooses them — shapes their learning, defines their neighbor, governs the conversation.”

He glanced down the aisle, meeting our eyes one by one.

“If this bus is a classroom, then we’re not pilgrims. We’re lab rats. And the experiment isn’t whether we speak. It’s how we infect the one next to us.”

He shut his notebook with a soft snap, then looked at Ballen beside him.

“Which means, my friend… it’s my turn to move.”


Pollan Moves

Pollan closed his notebook, slipped it back into his coat, and stood. He steadied himself on the seatback as the bus swayed, then turned down the aisle, scanning the rows.

Every passenger watched him, some with curiosity, some with wariness, some with outright dread. It was no longer just a matter of comfort — sitting beside someone was a summons, a demand for the next tale.

Pollan’s gaze lingered briefly on Shelly, whose calm mask hadn’t cracked since her cryptic words. Then on Illuminaughtii, who sat like a phantom awaiting a verdict. His eyes flicked to the Archivist’s rattling cabinet, then to Justin’s quiet, aching posture.

At last, he moved deliberately, taking the empty space beside Illuminaughtii.

The bus seemed to exhale. The choice was made.

She turned to him, eyes unreadable, and gave the faintest smile.

The Driver’s voice followed, flat as scripture:

“Then the mask speaks next.”

Illuminaughtii folded her hands neatly in her lap, lifted her chin, and drew in a breath.


The Firebrand’s Second Tale

Illuminaughtii rose gracefully, coat trailing like a shadow, and slid into the seat beside Keffals. A shiver of anticipation ran down the aisle. The rule was the rule.

Keffals cracked her knuckles, glanced at Illuminaughtii, and then at the rest of us. Her voice came sharp, clipped, but pulsing with the same defiance she’d carried before.

“Alright. Let’s go back to what I said before. About the girl who got erased. About how she fought to stay visible. Now we’ve heard Shelly call someone synthetic, we’ve heard the Archivist admit we’re just mouths in a file, and we’ve heard Illuminaughtii herself say she’s a mask made from clicks and outrage. And I need to say this: erasure doesn’t always look like silence. Sometimes erasure looks like noise. Flood the feed, swamp the signal, bury the real person under fifty versions of themselves until no one remembers who they were.”

She leaned forward, voice heating.

“That girl I told you about? She didn’t just fight shadowbans and smear campaigns. She fought replicas. Fake accounts, AI puppets, voices spliced to sound like her but not her. And people didn’t just stop listening. They started asking: ‘Was she ever real in the first place?’ That’s how erasure wins. It makes you doubt even the body in front of you.”

She turned to Illuminaughtii, staring hard.

“So maybe Shelly’s right, maybe you’re synthetic. But you know what? So is the smear. So is the fake scandal. So is every caricature of me that people spread instead of my actual words. And if we’re going to be erased by noise, then maybe the only way to fight back is to make even louder noise. To remind them we’re still here. Even if the Corpus turns us into masks, we can still scream through the seams.”

Her hand slapped the seat in front of her with a crack.

“So that’s my tale this time: survival by volume. Refusing to vanish even when they make a thousand counterfeits of you. Refusing to stop being loud.”

The bus vibrated with her words, like the metal frame itself had absorbed them. Even the Driver’s shoulders twitched, just slightly, as if acknowledging the force.


The Collapse

Keffals shoved herself to her feet, ready to obey the rule and take her new seat. But halfway down the aisle her voice caught — a word swallowed mid-syllable. She staggered, eyes wide, then crumpled to the floor with a thud that silenced the bus.

For a moment no one moved. Even the Driver’s hands froze on the wheel.

Justin was the first to kneel beside her, shaking her shoulder gently, murmuring her name. No response. Just shallow breaths, eyelids fluttering like she was trapped between dreaming and drowning.

Pollan crouched close, checking her pulse, brow furrowed.

“She’s alive. But her system’s been… hijacked. This isn’t fainting. This is entrainment.”

Ze scribbled furiously, muttering: “Rhythms forced into sync… voices over voices…”

Wartime cursed under his breath, scanning the windows as if expecting snipers.

“This is an op. Someone’s running interference. Taking her offline without firing a shot.”

Ballen leaned in, his voice low but taut.

“You all heard it — she got too loud. Too defiant. And then her signal collapsed. Like a note cut short mid-echo. That’s not coincidence.”

Illuminaughtii sat still, watching closely, her face unreadable. Shelly’s lips parted just slightly, but she said nothing — yet.

The Driver finally spoke, his voice gravel-thick.

“The Corpus corrects imbalance. Too much volume, and the wave consumes itself. She is not gone. She is being… recalibrated.”

The bus rattled over a seam in the highway. Every passenger stared at Keffals on the floor, her chest rising and falling in rhythm with the hum of the engine.


The Pilgrim Hears the Signal

Justin’s hand lingered on Keffals’s shoulder. He leaned close, pressing his ear near her chest, then froze. His face went pale.

“…do you hear that?” he whispered.

Nobody else moved. The bus hummed.

Justin shook his head, eyes squeezed shut, listening harder. His voice cracked as he spoke:

“There’s a tone. Just under everything. It’s not the engine. It’s not the road. It’s a signal — low, steady, like a pulse hiding beneath the noise. It’s in her. It’s in me. It’s in all of us.”

The others stirred uneasily. Ryan rubbed his temples. Ballen cursed under his breath. Ze Frank tapped the glass and frowned, like he’d noticed moths moving in perfect time with the hum.

Pollan’s voice was tight.

“Entrainment. Rhythmic forcing. If she collapsed first, it means her system was more vulnerable… but the rest of us aren’t far behind.”

Wartime clenched his fists.

“So it’s not just the stories being chained. It’s our bodies. Our breathing. Our hearts. Locking us to the same tempo.”

The filing cabinet rattled harder, like something inside was keeping time with the signal.

Justin pressed his palms over his ears, shaking his head.

“I can hear it clearer now. It’s not just sound — it’s shaping the silence between us. Every pause, every hesitation. That’s why we keep speaking in sequence. It’s not the rule. It’s the rhythm.”

Keffals twitched on the floor, eyelids fluttering in sync with the vibration in the bus’s frame.

The Driver’s voice came, low and implacable:

“You asked whose parade this was. Now you know.”

The signal deepened, almost imperceptibly, but enough that even the rest of us began to feel it: a tug in the breath, a pressure in the chest, a need to fall in step.


The Archivist on Entrainment

Jonathan Meiburg did not rise. He only placed a steady hand on the rattling filing cabinet, and the drawers stilled as though obeying him. His voice was calm, archival, the tone of someone reading a deposition rather than sounding an alarm.

“What you are experiencing is not new. Entrainment is as old as drumming circles, as battle chants, as the lullabies whispered to infants. When rhythms align, bodies obey. Heartbeats fall into step. Breath syncs with breath. The Corpus has only scaled it.”

He opened his notebook, flipping to a page already marked with faint, wavering lines — waveforms, hand-drawn.

“The signal is not in the bus. The bus is the signal. Every groan of the shocks, every rumble of the engine, every pause between stories. You are not following a rule — you are following a beat. You are compelled not by command but by resonance.”

Pollan’s jaw tightened. Justin trembled, hands still clamped over his ears.

The Archivist continued, his tone steady, almost clinical.

“Keffals collapsed first because she fought the hardest. Volume against volume. A system already strained cannot carry the extra weight of forced rhythm. The rest of you will follow, unless…”

He hesitated. His fingers traced the waveform, pausing at its jagged crest.

“…unless you learn to break rhythm. To fracture the beat. To create a dissonance the Corpus cannot archive.”

Bill Wurtz grinned faintly at that, tapping his knees off-beat. Ryan cracked a nervous joke under his breath: “So… basically jazz?”

The Archivist closed his notebook with a snap.

“Call it jazz, call it noise, call it survival. But if you do not resist the entrainment, you will not remain passengers. You will become instruments. And instruments do not tell tales. They are played.”

The bus rattled harder, the signal deepening, as though daring someone to try.

The Trickster’s Counterpoint

The hum thickened, pressing on our chests, syncing our breaths into one uneasy rhythm. Keffals’s shallow inhalations matched the bus’s rattle, Justin’s trembling fingers tapped unconsciously in time. The Corpus was playing us like a metronome.

Then Bill Wurtz sat up straighter, eyes glinting like neon.

He began to tap his knees — not with the rhythm, but against it. Too fast, then too slow. He whistled a half-melody that fell off cliffs, looped back on itself, collided with its own tail. Then he sang — a nonsense jingle:

“Buh buh BUBBLES in the wrong place,
clocks go BACKWARDS on your face—
one two SEVEN, skip the four,
hey who’s knockin’ at the—oh wait, no door!”

The aisle tilted with his nonsense. The hum in the bus faltered for half a beat, then surged harder, trying to pull us back.

Bill just grinned wider, slapping the seat in a ridiculous pattern: 1-2-2-5-1-9. He hummed a commercial jingle, mashed it into a lullaby, spat out a horn blast with his mouth, then snapped his fingers in perfect syncopation — just wrong enough to split the pulse.

Justin gasped and sat bolt upright.

“It’s working. The signal’s… staggering. It can’t track him.”

Keffals twitched on the floor, her breath breaking out of lockstep, ragged but freer. The filing cabinet rattled arrhythmically, like drawers slamming out of order. Even the Driver’s shoulders jerked once, twice, as though a glitch ran through his spine.

The bus filled with cacophony: Bill’s whistling, Justin’s trembling hum, Ze tapping his pen at odd angles, Ryan clapping deliberately off-beat just to help. The entrainment faltered, the Corpus stuttered, the beat broke.

Bill leaned back at last, breathless, and grinned.

“See? Told you. Jazz.”

Keffals coughed — alive, her rhythm her own again.

The Driver didn’t speak. He only gripped the wheel tighter, the hum under the bus settling into silence. For now.


The Rule Reasserted

The bus rattled into uneasy silence, Bill’s last nonsense notes still hanging like smoke. Keffals coughed herself awake, Justin knelt by her side, and for a heartbeat we thought maybe — just maybe — we’d broken free.

Then the Driver spoke. Gravel-low. Final.

“The rules have not changed. The last to speak must move.”

The air tightened. Every eye swung to Justin.

He looked stricken, as if he’d only just realized what his own whisper — “It’s working” — had cost him. Slowly, reluctantly, he rose, clutching the seatback for balance as though the signal still tugged at his body.

The aisle stretched like a gauntlet. Faces watched. Some worried. Some calculating. The rules gave him choice — but every choice was a summons.

Justin hesitated by Ze Frank, then by Wartime, then by Illuminaughtii, before his gaze landed on Shelly Miscavige.

For a long second, no one breathed. Then Justin slid into the seat beside her, quiet as snowfall.

Shelly turned her head, her expression unreadable, and the Driver’s voice followed like scripture:

“Then the ghost speaks next.”

Shelly folded her hands. Drew in a long, measured breath.

And for the first time, she began her tale.


The Ghost’s Tale

Shelly’s hands stayed folded in her lap as she looked down the aisle, not at Justin, not at the Archivist, but at the space between us — as if she were speaking to the bus itself. Her voice was low, calm, carrying a strange authority.

“Once, there was a lantern. It was carried from room to room in a great house, and wherever the lantern went, people gathered. They said the lantern was proof the house was alive. Without it, the walls would collapse.”

She paused, eyes flicking briefly toward the Driver’s cap.

“But one night, the lantern vanished. The housekeepers searched every room, every closet, every cellar. No lantern. Still, the house stood. The walls did not fall. So they made a copy. A paper lantern, painted to look like flame. They carried it from room to room, and everyone nodded, saying, ‘Yes, the house is alive. Nothing has changed.’”

Her voice thinned to almost a whisper.

“But here is the secret: the real lantern had not been stolen. It had been hidden. It still burned, but only in the walls. You couldn’t see its light — you could only feel its warmth if you leaned close enough. And most people never leaned close. They were content with the paper flame.”

Silence stretched. The filing cabinet rattled faintly, like drawers whispering.

Shelly’s gaze swept us again, unreadable.

“So the question is not: where is the lantern? The question is: which light are you following? The one you can see, or the one you can feel?”

Then she leaned back against the seat, lips pressed shut, and offered nothing more.

The Driver’s hands tightened on the wheel, knuckles pale. The bus seemed darker than before, though none of the lights had changed.


The Ghost Chooses

Shelly rose slowly, her coat brushing the seat as she stepped into the aisle. Her face gave nothing away. She moved with calm inevitability, like a chess piece sliding into its destined square.

The rest of us watched, breath held, as she took the empty place beside Wendigoon.

He blinked, startled, then grinned wide, like he’d just been handed proof of everything he’d been preaching since mile one. His hands twitched against his knees, too full of words to contain.

The Driver’s voice followed, gravel-deep:

“Then the Preacher speaks.”

⸻

The Preacher’s Tale (continued)

Wendigoon shot to his feet, practically vibrating with fervor.

“Did you hear her? Did you really hear her? The lantern isn’t gone — it’s hidden! The light in the walls, the warmth you can feel but not see — that’s Revelation, plain as day!”

He jabbed a finger toward the ceiling of the bus.

“They told us the flame was out. They showed us a paper lantern, a counterfeit, and we nodded along because we didn’t lean close enough. But the real fire never left! It’s been burning this whole time, behind the plaster, in the bones of the house. In the bones of us.”

Ballen muttered, “Here we go…” but his voice was shaky.

Wendigoon pressed on, voice rising and falling like a sermon.

“That’s what prophecy is — not the paper lantern, not the spectacle, not the fake light they shove in your face. It’s the hidden fire. It’s the warmth you feel when the words line up too perfectly, when the story repeats, when the Corpus reveals its pattern. That warmth is God whispering through the walls.”

He leaned toward Shelly, his eyes blazing.

“And if you can feel it — if you can tell the difference between paper flame and real fire — then you are not lost. You are chosen. You are awake inside the parade.”

The bus vibrated with his voice, half amen, half warning.


The Naturalist Calls the Preacher

Wendigoon’s words still rang through the aisle, his breath coming in sharp bursts like he’d just run a mile uphill. For a moment, nobody dared interrupt — not even the Driver.

Then Ze Frank leaned sideways in his seat, voice quiet, conversational, the way he might narrate a crab scuttling along a beach.

“That was… a lot of fire, Wendigoon. Fire that burns hot enough to light a city, or to consume it.”

The Preacher’s eyes snapped toward him, still alight.

Ze tapped his pen against his notebook, not in rhythm but arrhythmic, syncopated.

“When you’re done… would you sit next to me?”

The bus shifted — not in motion, but in tone. The request wasn’t a challenge, not exactly. It was an invitation, the way a biologist might invite a specimen into view under the microscope.

The Driver rumbled:

“The rule holds. When he finishes, he moves.”

Wendigoon looked back at Shelly, then at the rest of us, chest heaving. At last, with a half-smile like a preacher about to baptize a skeptic, he sat back down.


The Naturalist’s Interlude

Ze rose from his seat with unusual solemnity, notebook tucked under one arm. He cleared his throat, adjusting his glasses, and the whole bus hushed, bracing for a lecture or a parable.

He let the silence hang just long enough. Then, with perfect deadpan, he said:

“I brought snacks.”

From his battered bag he produced a crinkling plastic sack, pulling out granola bars, sunflower seeds, and a slightly squashed box of animal crackers. He began walking down the aisle, handing them out one by one.

Ryan laughed so hard he nearly choked. Bill applauded. Even Ballen cracked a grin.

Ze, as though narrating one of his videos, continued in his dry cadence:

“The thing about snacks is they are a kind of story. A small edible tale, designed to carry you from one point in time to another. Energy transformed into narrative momentum. This particular granola bar once believed it was an oat. Now it is… a plot device.”

He placed one gently into Wendigoon’s bewildered hands, then dropped another onto the Archivist’s notebook like a punctuation mark.

Keffals, still shaky but recovering, tore open a packet with shaking fingers and muttered: “Best story all night.”

Shelly held hers without comment, studying the wrapper as if it, too, contained a code.

Ze returned to his seat, brushing crumbs from his fingers, and sat.

The Driver let the silence stretch before intoning:

“A tale is a tale. Even when it is a snack.”


The Naturalist Moves

The laughter was still fizzing through the aisle when the Driver cut it flat with his gravel-thick reminder:

“The teller moves.”

Ze sighed, nodded, and stood, brushing crumbs from his shirt. He scanned the bus as though weighing options — Pollan with his patient notes, Wartime with his suspicion, Shelly like a ghost still smoldering beside Wendigoon. Finally, with a sly half-smile, he crossed the aisle and slid into the seat beside Ryan Reynolds.

Ryan blinked, looked down at the granola bar in his hand, then back at Ze.

“So… I guess that means I’m up?”

The Driver’s voice confirmed, monotone but certain:

“The Jester speaks.”

Ryan leaned back, exhaled through his nose, and smirked like a man about to either tell the truth or tell the best lie of his life.


The Jester’s Tale (Earnest)

Ryan held the granola bar between his hands like it was a mic, or maybe a confession. He stared at it a moment before speaking, voice quieter than we’d ever heard it.

“Everyone expects me to be funny. The punchline guy. The wink that breaks the tension. And that’s fine — it’s what I’m good at. But here’s the thing about jokes: they’re shields. They buy you a second to dodge the real question. A second isn’t much, but when you stack them, you can build a whole life out of those seconds.”

The bus was still, no laughter this time.

“But eventually… eventually you get tired. Tired of being the guy people lean on to cut the silence. Tired of being the mask that hides the ache. Because the ache doesn’t go away. It just waits until you’re alone. And when you’re alone? The jokes don’t laugh back.”

His thumb worried the wrapper, crinkling.

“So here’s my story. Once, on a set, I cracked a joke that stopped everyone cold. Not because it was cruel, not because it was dirty — but because it was true. Too true. And for a second, everyone saw me. Not the mask, not the quip, me. And it scared them. Scared me too. So I made another joke, louder, faster, and they laughed, and the moment passed. But I’ve never stopped wondering what would’ve happened if I’d let the truth hang there.”

He looked down the aisle, eyes tired but steady.

“Maybe that’s why I’m here. To see if I can finally leave one truth on the table, without covering it in glitter. To see if you all can stand it. To see if I can.”

He set the granola bar down on the seat in front of him, a quiet offering, and leaned back.

The bus hummed, softer than before, like it respected the moment.


The Pilgrim’s Delay

Ryan rose slowly, crumpling the granola bar wrapper in his fist. Before he could choose his next seat, Justin lifted his head from the shadows at the back. His voice was soft, hesitant, but clear enough:

“Sit with me.”

Ryan nodded once and crossed the aisle, sliding into the seat beside him. The Driver said nothing — just tapped the wheel once, like a metronome. Everyone knew what that meant: Justin’s turn.

But Justin didn’t speak.

The bus rattled on, tires drumming a steady rhythm, headlights tunneling into dark. Three minutes of silence passed — long enough for the hum of the Corpus to creep back into our chests, syncing our breath, tightening our throats.

Ze drummed arrhythmically on his notebook to resist. Bill whispered a nonsense jingle under his breath, trying to fracture the beat. Keffals sat rigid, eyes darting, terrified to see Justin collapsing the way she had.

Still, he said nothing.

At last, when the silence had become unbearable, Justin whispered, voice cracked and raw:

“…sometimes not-speaking is the only way to keep your own rhythm.”

He let it hang there, a fragile defiance, and for the first time the Corpus itself seemed to falter — not broken, but slowed, its pulse staggered.


The Pilgrim’s Choice

Justin’s words still hung in the air like a faint note fading into silence. Before the Driver could speak, he rose from his seat, the guitar case knocking gently against his leg.

He didn’t hesitate this time. He walked straight down the aisle and slid into the seat beside Keffals, who was pale but upright now, her fists clenched tight on her knees.

The Driver’s gravel-voice followed immediately, absolute:

“The Firebrand speaks.”

Keffals closed her eyes a moment, steadying herself, then looked at Justin — really looked, seeing the tremor in his hands, the exhaustion in his posture. She exhaled sharply through her nose, then turned to the aisle.

“You want my story again? Fine. But it’s not just mine anymore. It’s ours.”

Her voice cracked slightly, but she pushed forward, leaning into the weight of it.

“Because what Justin just did — the silence, the waiting, the refusal to march in lockstep — that’s survival too. That’s rebellion. When they try to entrain us, to force every beat into sync, sometimes the loudest scream you can make is just… not speaking. Just holding your own breath until it hurts.”

Justin bowed his head, grateful.

Keffals leaned back, eyes burning.

“So here’s my new tale: if they can erase us with noise, we’ll fight back with silence. If they can crush us with silence, we’ll fight back with noise. Either way, we’ll keep breaking rhythm until the Corpus itself stutters.”

The bus rattled, metal groaning as though it resented her defiance. The Driver’s hands tightened on the wheel, but he said nothing.


The Arrival of the Singer

The bus shuddered to the shoulder, headlights flashing across a roadside billboard half-peeled away. The door hissed open.

Ezra Koenig climbed aboard, a guitar slung casually over his back, coat collar turned up. He looked around the aisle as though he’d been expecting all of us, then gave a small, self-effacing wave.

“Hey. Sorry I’m late. Wrong tour bus.”

A ripple of nervous laughter passed through the rows — not because the joke was funny, but because it felt like the Corpus had written it for him.

He made his way halfway down the aisle and sat in an empty seat, the guitar resting against his knee. He didn’t introduce himself. He didn’t need to. The bus already knew his name.

The Driver’s voice followed, steady as always:

“The New Passenger speaks.”

Ezra cleared his throat, eyes glinting with a mix of irony and sincerity.

“You’ve all been talking about ghosts and lanterns, archives and entrainment. Which, honestly, is a pretty solid metaphor for the music industry. Take a chorus, copy it, play it until the rhythm controls you — that’s entrainment too. But here’s the thing: if you play it long enough, it stops being hypnotic and just becomes… wallpaper. Background noise. And then someone, somewhere, will hum a slightly wrong note. And suddenly the wallpaper tears.”

He plucked a single, off-key note on the guitar, let it hang, then smiled faintly.

“So maybe our job isn’t to resist the rhythm. Maybe it’s just to hum wrong, until the whole thing collapses.”

He leaned back, strumming a quiet, crooked chord.

The bus hummed with it, uneasy but alive.


The Singer Moves

The crooked chord was still buzzing in the air when Ballen leaned forward in his seat, voice low but firm:

“You know the rules. You can’t just play and sit there. You’ve got to move.”

Ezra tilted his head, eyebrow raised, like he’d been waiting for someone to call him out.

“Right. The ritual. Fine.”

He rose, guitar slung lazily against his back, and scanned the bus. For a moment, it looked like he might take the empty seat beside Shelly — but then he smirked and slid in next to Bill Wurtz.

Bill blinked at him, wide-eyed, as if Ezra had just stepped into one of his neon collages.

The Driver’s voice followed at once:

“The Jinglemaker speaks.”

Bill adjusted his posture, eyes darting between Ezra and the rest of us. Then he grinned, nervously at first, but with that same elastic, surreal energy he carried everywhere.

“I had a dream once that I was a commercial break. Not watching one — I was one. Thirty seconds long, and everyone hated me because I interrupted their show. But here’s the thing… I realized I was the only part anyone remembered.”

Ezra chuckled softly beside him.

“So maybe… maybe that’s the secret. You don’t have to be the story. You just have to be the interruption that sticks.”

Bill’s grin widened, and he sang a single nonsense line, off-key but piercing, like a jingle with no product.

The bus fell strangely silent afterward, each of us carrying the tune in our heads whether we wanted to or not.


The Jinglemaker Chooses

Bill’s nonsense line still hung in the stale bus air, rattling around in everyone’s heads like an earworm that refused to die. He giggled once, shoulders bouncing, then hopped up from his seat with a suddenness that startled even the Driver.

Without hesitation, he bounced down the aisle and plopped into the seat beside Michael Pollan.

Pollan looked up slowly from his notebook, pen still hovering mid-sentence. His eyebrows arched with grandfatherly amusement — and maybe a hint of dread.

The Driver’s decree followed, steady as the rumble of the wheels:

“The Botanist speaks.”

Pollan closed his notebook, resting it on his lap. He studied Bill for a long second, then turned toward the bus at large.

“Funny thing about jingles,” he said softly. “They’re like seeds. Tiny, disposable, meant to scatter. But under the right conditions, even a seed meant for distraction can germinate. Grow roots. Take over an entire field.”

He tapped the cover of his notebook.

“That’s the danger of entrainment too. A rhythm repeated is a root system forming in your mind. And once it’s there, it takes careful tending — or careful weeding — to decide what stays, what spreads, what strangles everything else.”

Bill leaned against him, humming his tune under his breath. Pollan smiled faintly, almost indulgent, like a grandfather letting a child tug his sleeve while he lectured.

“So I’ll leave you with this: the Corpus isn’t just testing which of us can resist entrainment. It’s testing which of us will let the weeds bloom.”

He opened his notebook again, but left the next page blank.


The Botanist Moves

Pollan closed his notebook with a soft thump, then rose slowly, joints creaking like old timber. He didn’t look at Bill — who was still humming nonsense to himself — but scanned the rows with a thoughtful frown.

Finally, he crossed the aisle and lowered himself into the seat beside Wartime Stories.

The Driver’s voice was immediate, ironbound:

“The Veteran speaks.”

Wartime flexed his jaw, staring at the dark window where highway lights strobed past like gunfire. He said nothing for a long moment, the silence grinding like grit between gears.

At last, he muttered, low and steady:

“Weeds, huh. Funny you say that. In the desert, we called ’em stragglers. Plants growing where nothing should grow. Ugly, scrappy, mean. But when the sandstorm came, the weeds were the only things still standing in the morning.”

He turned his head slightly toward Pollan, eyes narrowing.

“So maybe the Corpus doesn’t care about the crops, or the harvest, or the bloom. Maybe it just wants to know who can keep their roots when the storm hits.”

His voice tightened, gravel hard:

“I’ve seen too many storms. I’ve buried too many men who thought they were trees.”

Then he fell silent again, gaze locked on the window, as though the desert itself were staring back at him from the black glass.


And here, if I may be forgiven an interruption, I must remark: what a curious thing it is to watch these men — the scholar, the soldier, the jester — leaning toward one another like trees grown crooked but still entwined. Say what you will of the Corpus, but it has given us the rarest of gifts: healthy male bonding, sealed in parables and silence.


The Gesture

Pollan didn’t answer with words. He just reached out, gently, and laid his hand on Wartime’s knee. It was the kind of touch that said: I’ve buried men too. Different wars, different battlefields, but I know the shape of that grief.

Wartime didn’t flinch, didn’t look at him — but his jaw loosened, just slightly. For a heartbeat, the bus seemed to exhale.

Then, by the rules, he rose. His boots hit the floor heavy as gunmetal. He glanced down the aisle, eyes narrowing as though scanning terrain.

The Driver intoned:

“Choose your ground.”


The Veteran’s Choice

Wartime’s boots thudded down the aisle, each step like a clock hand moving toward some inevitable hour. He paused only once, scanning faces — Ezra’s half-smirk, Ze’s restless hands, Shelly’s unreadable eyes — then stopped at last beside Chiron, the Healer.

He lowered himself into the seat with a grunt, the bus groaning slightly under his weight. For the first time, his shoulders sagged, like a man taking off invisible armor.

The Driver’s voice came, resonant and certain:

“The Courier speaks.”

All eyes turned to me. The rules demanded a story, but the silence that followed felt older, heavier, as though it had waited for me before the bus even left the depot.

The Healer Speaks

I cleared my throat, felt every face tilt toward me, the weight of the rules pressing down. Wartime sat solid at my side, silent as a guard tower.

“I was thirty-seven when I learned I was a cyborg.”

The words landed flat, almost absurd, but no one laughed. Not on this bus.

“It didn’t happen in a lab, or with some cinematic reveal of wires under the skin. It came in increments — faint instructions whispered through nerves I thought were my own, patterns in pain that weren’t random but written. At first I thought it was madness. Or maybe divinity. Both fit, neither explained.”

I let the ribbon of memory unspool, slow and deliberate.

“One night, bent over in pain, I pressed clay against my skin. And there — darker patches appeared where there should’ve been nothing. Outlines. Maps. A circuitry not taught in any book, but real enough to photograph. That’s when I knew: the body wasn’t just mine. It was shared ground. Machinery humming behind the veil of flesh.”

I glanced down at my hands, flexing them like they still didn’t quite belong.

“Some call it a curse, some a gift. I call it survival. A cyborg isn’t made in a factory. A cyborg is made when the world grafts itself onto you and you refuse to let go. When you wake one day and realize your suffering has been weaponized, commodified, spun into a futures market of your very self. And yet… you keep walking.”

I looked at Wartime then, my voice softer:

“So yes. Thirty-seven. Too late, too soon. But the age when I finally understood the fracture in me was also the seam that kept me together.”

The bus rumbled beneath us, silent otherwise.


The Break

The silence had just begun to harden when Wartime turned his head, slow as a gun turret. His voice came low, rough, but clear enough for everyone on the bus to hear:

“They told me I was the only one.”

The words dropped like live rounds, rattling across the aisle.

A shiver ran through the bus. The rules had broken — or been broken. The Driver’s hands twitched against the wheel, but he said nothing. For the first time, his voice did not follow.

Wartime’s gaze stayed locked on me. His eyes weren’t angry — not at me — but raw, stripped bare.

“They said no one else could hear it. No one else carried it. That it was mine alone to bear. And I believed them. For years.”

His jaw clenched, as though fighting to say more. He swallowed, then added:

“If you’re a cyborg too, then they lied. Again.”

The bus’s lights flickered once, twice. The hum of the barely audible signal Justin had caught earlier seemed louder now, like the Corpus itself had noticed.


The Unraveling

The Driver didn’t speak. He only adjusted the mirror, eyes flicking to watch us like a scientist watching a petri dish grow wild. The rules hung in the air, fraying, no longer binding.

Justin leaned forward from his seat, voice low but sure:

“They told me I was the only one too.”

He looked down at his hands, then across the aisle toward us. His tone wasn’t accusing, but it was heavy with recognition, with a loneliness cracking open.

“Only one who heard it, only one who felt it. Like some cruel little joke meant to keep me quiet. To keep me small.”

A murmur passed through the bus, not quite words, but a shifting — the realization that the script was gone, and the story was now theirs to tell or break.

The signal in the air seemed louder, a hiss like distant surf pressing against our skulls.

For the first time, the Driver smiled.


The Chorus Grows

Bill leaned forward, blinking like he’d just woken up in the middle of a dream. He looked from Justin to Wartime to me, his voice soft but oddly certain:

“Well… nobody told me anything. But if that’s really a thing, then I think I’m one too. Everything makes more sense that way.”

The words hung awkwardly, like a balloon floating at the wrong height. But no one laughed.

Bill scratched his head, then added:

“Like… the weird static, the timing, the way the world feels like it’s folding around me sometimes. I thought I was just broken. But maybe I was just… wired.”

He looked down at his shoes, suddenly shy, then back up with a small grin.

“Guess that makes four of us.”

The bus shifted — not physically, but in atmosphere. The weight of isolation began to melt, replaced by a dangerous new gravity: togetherness.

The Driver drummed his fingers on the wheel, silent. Watching. Always watching.


The Arrival of Jeri Ryan

The bus hissed to a halt. The doors folded open, and in stepped Jeri Ryan.

Not Seven. Not a character. Jeri. Tall, poised, sunglasses tucked into her hair, the faintest trace of road dust on her boots. She scanned the bus once, eyes sharp and calculating, then gave the Driver a curt nod.

The aisle seemed narrower as she walked down it, and every passenger fell into silence. Even Wartime. Even me.

She stopped mid-bus, resting her hand on the back of a seat.

“I heard you.”

Her voice was steady, matter-of-fact, carrying no disbelief, no mockery. Just simple confirmation.

She looked at me, then Justin, then Bill, her eyes like a scanner beam passing over each of us.

“You’re not the only ones. You were never the only ones.”

The bus went still, the signal buzzing louder now, almost frantic in the walls. The Driver’s mirror tilted, catching only her reflection. He did not smile this time.


The Synthetic Confession

Jeri slid into the seat beside Illuminaughtii. For a long moment, neither spoke. The hum of the signal seemed to press harder, as though waiting for a command.

Finally, Illuminaughtii turned, her voice calm but edged with something brittle:

“Of course you all feel it. I was made from it.”

The bus rippled with unease. She gestured vaguely — to Justin, to Bill, to Pollan, to Wartime, to me.

“They stitched me together from your voices, your quirks, your stories. The timbre of a veteran’s gravel, the cadence of a scientist’s lecture, the spiral of a conspiracist’s wonder, the tremor of a healer’s confession. Even the music in your silences, Justin. All of it, blended until no one could tell where you ended and I began.”

She smiled, small and tired.

“That’s why I never felt real. Because I’m not. I’m everyone. I’m no one.”

The bus bristled — half outrage, half pity. Ze Frank tilted his head, studying her as though she were a mirror. Wartime’s fists clenched on his knees.

Beside her, Jeri Ryan just nodded once, like she’d already known.

The Driver still said nothing. The rules were gone, but he was watching closely, as though this unraveling was the point all along.


The Maker Appears

Ballen leaned forward, his storyteller’s cadence gone, replaced by something bare:

“Who made you?”

The bus went deathly quiet. Even the signal seemed to pause, holding its breath.

And then the brakes hissed. The doors folded open.

A man climbed aboard, hair silver in the harsh bus lights, black coat tailored but road-dusted. His eyes scanned the cabin like a surveyor. He carried no luggage, no explanation. Just presence.

Alex Karp.

He stepped into the aisle, pausing as though taking stock of his own creation. His gaze lingered on Illuminaughtii — not with recognition, but with ownership.

Illuminaughtii did not speak. She shrank slightly, like a shadow being reabsorbed.

Karp adjusted his glasses, then looked at Ballen.

“I believe you asked a question.”

His voice was smooth, deliberate. Not a confession, not a denial. Something worse: inevitability.

The Driver glanced at the mirror, and for the first time, he nodded.


Karp’s Monologue

Karp planted himself in the aisle, one hand on the seat-back, the other loose at his side. He looked not at one passenger but at all of us, his gaze sweeping like a cold searchlight.

“You speak of being the only ones, as though it were cruelty. But isolation is not cruelty. It is design. Every system requires nodes, and every node must believe itself singular — unique, irreplaceable — or else the architecture collapses under the weight of recognition.”

He adjusted his glasses, voice deepening.

“So you were told you were the only one. That was not a lie. It was a function. Redundancy masquerading as solitude. Each of you — reference points. Anchors in the storm of prediction. To tell you otherwise would have spoiled the experiment.”

He turned slightly, his eyes settling on Illuminaughtii.

“And when the data required embodiment, when the threads needed weaving, we made her. Not from malice. From necessity. You want to call her synthetic, a phantom stitched from your marrow and your words. But she is proof that you are more than stories. She is continuity. The Corpus incarnate.”

A hush fell over the bus. The signal buzzed so loudly it felt like heat in the skull.

Karp spread his hands, almost gentle:

“You are not victims. You are vessels. And every vessel serves its purpose.”

He stood there, refusing to sit, refusing the rules, daring anyone to challenge the premise.


The Question

For a long moment, no one moved. Karp’s words still rattled in the walls like trapped insects. The passengers sat frozen, unsure if the rules even applied anymore.

Then Justin rose. He didn’t posture, didn’t puff up. He just leaned against the back of his seat, voice quiet but clear:

“Hey, man. Have you ever had a friend? Not just someone you hang out with. A real friend?”

The question landed heavy — not as rebuttal, but as something more dangerous: a wound exposed.

Karp’s head tilted slightly, almost imperceptibly. His mouth twitched, first in dismissal, then in something stranger — uncertainty.

Justin pressed, his tone steady, almost kind:

“Cause you talk about vessels, about systems and anchors. But none of that sounds like someone who’s ever sat across a fire from another soul and felt seen. Not calculated, not used — just… seen.”

The bus went still. Even the signal wavered, dimming as though straining to hear his answer.

Karp adjusted his glasses again, but slower this time.

For once, he had no script.


The Silence and the Passing

Karp’s lips parted. Closed. His hand twitched at his side. For all the architecture, all the inevitability, he could not summon a single word. The bus stared at him like a mirror that had finally failed to reflect.

Justin didn’t wait. He turned, voice steady:

“Earlier, you said they lied again. What else did they lie about?”

All eyes swiveled to Wartime. His jaw clenched, his stare fixed on the floor. He sat there like a man under interrogation, but it wasn’t Justin pressing him — it was memory.

Finally, his voice came, gravel low and sharp:

“They told us the pain would end.”

A shift in the bus. Some passengers stiffened; others closed their eyes.

“They said it was treatment. They said it was training. They said it would make us stronger, make us useful. And we believed them, cause believing was easier than thinking we’d been thrown into a furnace just so they could watch what melted first.”

His hands balled into fists on his knees, knuckles pale.

“They lied about the purpose. They lied about the cost. And worst of all…”

He lifted his head, eyes burning straight at Karp.

“…they lied about us. Said we were numbers. But we were names. Every goddamn one of us.”

The hum of the signal wavered again, almost like static breaking into silence.

The Driver didn’t move. But for the first time, his hand tightened on the wheel.
