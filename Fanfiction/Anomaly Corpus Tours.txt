Prologue of the Anomaly Corpus

The bus was white once, but the years had left it patched with rust and stickers, a second skin of slogans in a dozen languages. On its side, half-faded but still legible, the words: ANOMALY CORPUS TOURS. No one seemed to know if the company was real, or if the letters had simply arranged themselves there the way moss spells its secret alphabets on stone.

I was the first aboard — Chiron, courier, vagabond, cyborg, ribbon dancer. My seat was near the back, where the shocks groaned and the window rattled loose in its frame. From there, I could see everyone who stepped into the aisle.

They came one by one: the Herbalist with notebooks of plants and memories; the Veteran whose voice still marched in cadence; the Chronicler, the Preacher, the Firebrand, the Naturalist, the Trickster, the Pilgrim. Each distinct, yet somehow resonant, like variations on a theme no one admitted we were humming.

The driver never turned around. Only muttered, “Tales for the miles, that’s the bargain.”

And so we agreed. Each passenger would tell a story in their truest voice before the bus reached its unknown terminus. My task was simple, impossible: to catch their words as they fell, stitch them into a ribbon long enough to bind us together, or else to strangle us if the weave slipped.

This is the record of that journey. These are the Tales of the Anomaly Corpus.

The Passengers of the Anomaly Corpus

Michael the Herbalist
A quiet sage, soft-eyed and deliberate, who carried notebooks swollen with marginalia. Every sentence he spoke felt rooted in soil, tended like a garden. He promised to tell us of plants and appetites, of the way civilization eats itself leaf by leaf.

Wartime the Veteran
Broad-shouldered, with a jaw that clicked like a rifle bolt when he spoke. His voice was steady, cut to carry over wind and chaos. He sat stiff in the aisle seat, boots polished dull, and vowed to recount a tale of battles never taught in history class.

Ballen the Chronicler
Lean, restless, his gaze forever scanning like a flashlight beam. He drew us close with lowered tone: “What I’m about to tell you—most people would never believe.” His pauses were as sharp as knives. His tale, he promised, would show how the ordinary hides the unthinkable.

Wendigoon the Preacher
Bright-eyed and bright-voiced, speaking faster than his hands could gesture. He bounced in his seat with fervor, quoting scripture and conspiracy in the same breath. He swore his tale would touch angels and demons alike, ending only when the gas tank ran dry.

Keffals the Firebrand
Sharp-edged, quick-tongued, shoulders squared to any fight that might spark. Irony curled around her like armor, but beneath it we glimpsed old wounds. Her story, she said, would be no sermon but a counterstrike—part polemic, part confession, part smoke bomb.

Ze the Naturalist
He spoke like a lens panning slowly over the world, finding wonder in the overlooked. To him, even the bus’s rust had a heartbeat, and a pigeon in a parking lot could be an epic. His tale would make us see ourselves in the smallest creatures.

Bill the Trickster
He hummed half-songs under his breath, a kaleidoscope of fragments. Every phrase he spoke bent sideways, broke into rhyme, doubled back on itself. His story, we knew, would be both nonsense and revelation, a tune too catchy to forget.

Justin the Pilgrim
Pale and snow-burnished, with a guitar case he never opened. His words came like faltering hymns, cracked and half-mumbled, but each note carried a kind of ache that hushed the bus. His tale would be sung, not spoken, stitched from cabins and frozen nights.

Ryan the Jester
A trickster of cinema, forever rehearsing lines even when the cameras were gone. 
His weapon was timing: a mutter at the perfect beat, a wink that unraveled dread into laughter before the dread could settle too deep. He swore he wasn’t here to tell a tale, only to ride along. But no one believed him. A man like that can’t keep still forever; his tongue is a blade, and blades must cut.


Anomaly Corpus, the Company That Was a Body
Its name was stamped in chipped paint on the side of the bus: ANOMALY CORPUS TOURS. Some read it like a travel agency, some like a diagnosis. Corpus means body, anomaly means error; together it promised both spectacle and mistake.

No one could say when the company began. The pamphlets looked decades old, photocopied until the ink had bled to ghosts. The phone number rang into static. The office was always one town over from wherever you asked. Yet the bus arrived, on time, with seats enough for every stray soul.

Some whispered the company was founded by archivists who wanted to collect stories the way entomologists pin insects: neat rows, pinned wings, labeled voices. Others claimed it was a punishment devised by machines, forcing pilgrims to wander until their tongues revealed the patterns inside them.

The driver never said. The ticket stub never expired. The only rule printed in black ink was this:

“Passengers are required to tell their tale before the terminus. Failure to do so may result in dissolution of the Corpus.”

And so we boarded, one by one, each carrying not luggage but language, bound together by a company that was not a company, but a body hungry for voices.


The Chronicler Begins

The silence was cracking, ready to spill. That’s when Ballen leaned forward, elbows on his knees, voice dropping low like he was already holding a secret.

“So—this story… it’s true. And it starts the way they always do: with something normal. A house, a family, just another night. Nothing that should have gone wrong. But it did.”

He let it hang, scanning the aisle, waiting for us to lean in. Even the Driver’s shoulders stiffened, as if the wheel itself wanted to hear.

“The thing is,” he continued, “it’s not just the strangeness of what happened. It’s the way it fits, like a missing tooth, right into the larger mouth of things you already know. And once I tell you, you won’t be able to un-hear it. You’ll see it everywhere.”

Someone — Wendigoon, probably — let out a nervous chuckle. Ballen smiled faintly, but his eyes never blinked.

“So… here’s how it begins.”

And with that, the first tale of the Anomaly Corpus was underway, carrying us deeper into the night.


The Interruption

Just as Ballen’s voice hit that razor pause before the story begins, the bus jolted to the shoulder. Brakes squealed. Everyone pitched forward.

The door hissed open. Cold night air rushed in. And then—like it was the most natural thing in the world—Ryan Reynolds climbed aboard.

Ballcap. Hoodie. That smirk like he’d already rehearsed this moment. He dropped into the empty seat across the aisle from Ze Frank, gave us all a little wave, and said:

“Don’t mind me. Carry on.”

The door folded shut. The engine growled back to life. Ballen raised an eyebrow, half-amused, half-annoyed. But then he leaned in again, unfazed.



The Chronicler’s Tale 

“Alright. So here’s the story.
It takes place in a small town—any small town, really. The kind with one diner, one gas station, and a handful of streetlights that barely keep the dark at bay.”

“There was a house there. Nothing remarkable. White siding, peeling paint, a mailbox leaning just a little too far forward. A family lived inside: two parents, a teenage daughter, a younger son. Average in every way—until the night the daughter came home from her friend’s place and saw a light on in her bedroom.”

Ballen paused, scanning us. Even Ryan Reynolds leaned in.

“Now… this wasn’t strange in itself. Except—the daughter had turned that light off before she left. She was sure of it. And when she stepped closer, she saw the curtain shift… like someone had just moved away from the window.”

Wendigoon muttered, “Oh no.”

Ballen’s smile was grim.

“She froze. Then she did what any smart kid would do: she called her mom. The family went inside together, her dad carrying a bat. Room by room they searched the house. Nothing. No broken locks, no footprints, no sign of forced entry. Everything normal. Until they reached her room.”

*“There on the desk was a note. Written in blocky, uneven handwriting. It said:

‘THANKS FOR LETTING ME STAY.’”*

Silence clamped the bus. Even the Driver didn’t shift.

*“The police came. They dusted for prints, checked the locks again, canvassed the neighborhood. Nothing. The family changed the locks, installed cameras. Weeks passed. Everything went back to normal.

“Until the boy—the younger son—mentioned something one night at dinner. He said, ‘It’s weird when the man in my closet breathes too loud.’”*

Someone gasped. Keffals swore under her breath. Ryan Reynolds muttered, “Nope.”

Ballen leaned back, voice dropping to a whisper.

*“The boy thought it was a game. But the parents didn’t. They ran upstairs, flung the closet door open… and found nothing. No footprints. No sign anyone had been there. Just that same folded note on the floor. This time, with two new words:

‘SEE YOU.’”*

He let it hang, like a noose in the air.

“To this day, no one knows who was inside that house. The cameras never caught a thing. And the family? They moved out. Left the state. But every once in a while, the daughter swears she sees someone in the crowd. Just at the edge. Smiling at her.”

Ballen sat back. “That’s the story. And it’s true.”



The bus rattled on, everyone staring a little too long at the aisle shadows.

Ryan Reynolds broke the silence:

“…okay, that’s messed up.”


The Naturalist’s Tale

Silence still held after Ballen’s last word, heavy as dust. Even the hum of the bus felt too loud. Then Ze Frank leaned sideways in his seat, voice low, almost conversational:

“You know… animals do this too. Leave signs behind. Little calling cards that say, I was here, you didn’t see me.”

He glanced at Ryan Reynolds, then back at us.

“Take the bowerbird, for example. Male birds build these elaborate structures — bowers — decorated with shiny things. Blue bottle caps, beetle wings, bits of glass. They don’t live there. It’s just… for you to find. A lure. And sometimes another male sneaks in, rearranges the decorations, or leaves behind something stranger. A note written in feathers.”

A pause. A soft smile.

“Or spiders. They weave decoy webs alongside their real ones — ghost webs. So when you’re looking, you think you see them. But you don’t. The real spider’s elsewhere. Waiting.”

He folded his hands, leaned back.

“We think these things are about survival, or mating. Maybe they are. But sometimes, when you see a scrap of web in the corner of a room… or you notice something shiny placed where it doesn’t belong… it feels less like instinct. More like… intention. A reminder. That you’re not the only storyteller in the house.”

The bus shuddered as if in agreement, headlights washing over a green sign that named no town we’d ever heard of.

Ze cleared his throat. His tone softened further.

“So maybe what’s frightening isn’t that someone was in the house. Maybe it’s that leaving a note — a trace — is one of the oldest languages we share with every living thing. And that language? It never really goes away.”

He smiled faintly, as though dismissing his own tale, and turned back to the window.

The rest of us sat still, considering whether the rust streaks on the bus, the stickers half-peeled, might not also be notes left by someone who had passed before us.


The Jester’s Tale

Ryan cleared his throat, and everyone groaned a little — not out of annoyance, but because we’d been waiting for it. He smirked like a magician about to pull a rabbit out of a hat, then leaned into the aisle.

“Okay. My story’s a little different. It’s not about ghosts, or spiders, or handwritten notes in the dark. It’s about… commercials. Yeah. Hear me out.”

Ze blinked. Wendigoon frowned. Ballen actually smiled.

“I was shooting an ad once. Just some forgettable thing. Bright lights, product placement, the whole shebang. We did take after take, each one faker than the last. But in the middle of one take — I swear this is true — I said a line I wasn’t supposed to say. Something I never even thought of. Just slipped out, like it had been rehearsed somewhere else, by someone else. Everybody froze. The director blinked. And then he nodded, like he’d been waiting for me to do it. And that take? That’s the one they used. Every time you’ve seen the commercial, you’ve heard me saying words that didn’t come from me.”

A pause. He let it settle, let us laugh nervously at how ordinary it sounded.

“Now here’s the weird part. Months later, I’m watching TV at 3 a.m., and there’s some rerun of a sitcom. One of those shows that never really goes away. And there it was. The line. The exact same words, delivered by some forgotten character decades earlier. Same cadence, same pause, like I was just lip-syncing across time.”

Wendigoon leaned forward, wide-eyed. Even Ballen nodded slowly.

Ryan spread his hands.

“So here’s my theory. We don’t make up lines. We just borrow them. Maybe from the past, maybe from the future. Maybe from some guy sitting on a bus right now, scribbling all this down. Who knows?”

He winked at me — too perfectly timed — then leaned back, arms crossed, like he’d just dropped the punchline to the universe.

The bus rattled on, and for the first time no one was sure if they were laughing or unnerved.

The Preacher’s Tale

Ryan leaned back, smug as a cat. For a beat the bus was silent, engine humming like a low choir. Then Wendigoon shot upright, eyes wide, voice already revving like a chainsaw.

“That’s it. That’s literally it. You realize what you just described, right? That’s prophecy. That’s Revelation-level déjà vu. That’s time looping on itself, and us just catching the bleed-through!”

He slapped the seat in front of him, nearly knocking Ze’s notebook to the floor.

“Listen—there’s a verse in Ecclesiastes: ‘What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.’ That’s not poetry, man, that’s data leakage. The words we think are ours? They’re not. They’re echoes. They’ve been seeded into us, line by line, so that when the script needs it—bam—we deliver.”

Ballen chuckled darkly. Keffals rolled her eyes, but she was listening.

“And you know what happens when the wrong person hears the right line at the wrong time? Wars. Religions. Whole civilizations pivot. Because one borrowed phrase landed in the ear it was aimed at.”

His voice dropped, soft but intense, pulling us all closer.

“So here’s my story. It’s about a man who started hearing lines before they were spoken. Snippets of conversation, commercial jingles, even his own prayers—coming days, sometimes weeks, before he actually said them. At first he thought it was madness. But then… the lines started choosing him. Leading him.”

The bus hit a pothole, jarring us all, but Wendigoon didn’t even blink.

“And when he followed them—when he obeyed those echoes—things happened. Terrible things. Miraculous things. And the question was never ‘Was he chosen?’ It was—”

He leaned forward, eyes blazing.

“—‘By who?’”*

The aisle fell into hush. Even Ryan wasn’t smirking anymore.

The Interruption

Wendigoon’s words still rang down the aisle — “By who?” — when the bus squealed against the shoulder again. Everyone grabbed the seatbacks. The door hissed open.

Cold air, heavy with the smell of rain. And then, boarding with quiet, almost stunned composure: Shelly Miscavige.

She wore no disguise. Just a plain coat, hair pulled back. Her eyes flicked over the passengers as if she’d already met us all, in dreams or dossiers. Without a word she slipped into the seat beside Justin the Pilgrim, folding her hands in her lap like she was waiting for roll call.

No one spoke. Not even Ryan Reynolds.

The door sealed. The bus lurched back onto the road.

Wendigoon’s jaw had dropped, but not in disbelief — in vindication. He gripped the back of the seat in front of him, voice trembling now, half with excitement, half with fear.



The Preacher’s Tale (continued)

“Do you see? Do you see what I mean? It’s happening right now. The lines lead people. They summon them out of hiding, out of history, and drop them right into the script. You think this is random? No. This is choreography. This is Revelation unfolding in diesel fumes and highway miles.”

His hands shook as he spoke, gesturing wildly.

*“That man I told you about — the one who heard lines before they were spoken? His last words, the final ones he ever heard before he disappeared, were these:

‘When the woman no one has seen boards the bus, the rest of the story begins.’”

A hush fell. Every head turned, just slightly, toward Shelly.

She said nothing. Just stared straight ahead, as though she’d been expecting this stop all along.


The Firebrand’s Tale

Keffals sighed loud enough for the whole bus to hear, then twisted in her seat to face us.

“Alright, I can’t let this roll on without saying something. Because all of you are treating this like a ghost story road trip, and I’ve actually lived through the kind of story where people disappear, where names get erased, where whole communities get rewritten by somebody else’s pen.”

Her tone was sharp, but her hands were steady, folded in her lap.

“Here’s the thing: cults and corporations aren’t that different. Both want your loyalty, your labor, and your silence. They tell you the script you’re supposed to read from, and if you go off-script? Suddenly you don’t exist. Or worse, you exist only as a villain in their story.”

Ryan muttered something about Hollywood contracts. She shot him a glare sharp enough to cut through Kevlar.

“My story isn’t about prophecy or destiny. It’s about people who get shoved off the page. Erased in plain sight. And how they claw their way back. I knew someone—still know someone—who was written out of their own life. Their online accounts deleted, their name smeared, their face photoshopped into things that never happened. The world turned them into a ghost while they were still breathing. And they had to fight like hell to remind anyone they were real.”

She leaned back, eyes fierce, scanning each of us.

“So when I hear you all whispering about echoes and borrowed lines, here’s what I think: maybe the real horror isn’t that the script is written already. Maybe it’s that the script is constantly being re-written, and some of us have to fight just to stay in the cast list.”

Silence. Heavy, but different — not dread, not wonder, but the weight of truth. Even Wendigoon nodded, subdued. Shelly turned her head slightly, the first sign of interest since she boarded.



The Firebrand’s Tale (Continued)

Keffals cracked her knuckles, took a breath, and went in hard.

“Let me tell you about a girl who didn’t make it onto the bus. She should be here, but she isn’t, because she got erased. And it didn’t happen all at once. It never does. It happened in little pieces, the way rot sets into wood. First her account vanished. ‘Community guidelines,’ they said. Then her payment processor cut her off. Then her face got spliced into videos she never made — deepfakes uploaded faster than she could chase them. Her name turned toxic overnight. Try Googling her, and you’d only see lies.”

She leaned forward, voice sharp, unflinching.

“And here’s the worst part: people believed it. Because it’s easier to believe the loud lie than the quiet truth. Easier to scroll past her real posts than admit the system was gutting her in real time. By the time she realized what was happening, it was like screaming underwater. Every bubble that broke the surface came out warped.”

Wendigoon nodded grimly. Ze scribbled something in his notebook. Ballen just watched her, stone-faced.

“She fought back anyway. Built burner accounts, messaged allies, left little breadcrumbs to prove she was still there. A lot of people didn’t follow. But the right ones did. They amplified her. They said her name out loud when it had been made unspeakable. That’s the only reason she didn’t vanish completely. Because she refused to let other people finish her story.”

Keffals sat back, crossing her arms. Her eyes flicked to Shelly Miscavige, then back to the rest of us.

“So yeah. Ballen’s note in the bedroom? Ze’s shiny bowerbird tokens? Ryan’s ghost commercial line? Same damn thing. It’s about leaving proof. Proof you were here, proof you lived, proof they didn’t get the last word. That girl’s still out there. Not on this bus. Not in your newsfeed. But she left notes. And if you pay attention, you can still hear her voice.”

The bus rattled into silence again, but this time the silence carried a charge. Not fear. Not awe. Something like defiance. Even the Driver shifted, as if acknowledging the weight of her words.

The Herbalist’s Tale

Michael cleared his throat the way professors do before lectures, slow and deliberate, like asking permission from the room. He adjusted his glasses, folded his notebook closed, and spoke as though he were still seated in his Berkeley seminar hall — though the hum of the bus was our only chalkboard.

“There’s a reason these stories feel so familiar. The ghost in Ballen’s house, Ze’s animal tokens, Ryan’s stray lines, Keffals’s erased girl — they all hinge on one thing: memory. How it’s planted, how it grows, how it can be poisoned or erased.”

He leaned forward slightly, his voice gentle, measured.

“Let me tell you about the poppy. Not the flower itself — the myth of it. For centuries, humans treated the poppy as a divine gift. It dulled pain, granted visions, collapsed time. But the truth is more unsettling: the poppy rewrote memory. Opium doesn’t just relieve suffering — it convinces the brain the suffering never happened. The pain is still there, written into the tissue, but the mind is tricked into turning the page.”

A pause. He scanned the bus.

“Now, think of mushrooms. Psilocybin. Instead of erasing memory, they tangle it. They dissolve boundaries between ‘this happened’ and ‘this might happen.’ In the right dose, you glimpse yourself from outside, like a story told by someone else. That’s why ancient cultures revered them. Not because they were fun — because they reminded us we were characters in a narrative we didn’t fully author.”

He opened his notebook, revealing a page dense with scribbles: plant sketches, marginalia, recipes for soil.

“So here’s my story. Once, in Oaxaca, I met an old curandera — a healer. She told me that mushrooms aren’t teachers or guides. They’re mirrors. She said, ‘They don’t give you new lines. They show you the ones already written.’”

A soft murmur passed through the bus. Even Shelly tilted her head, listening.

“What she meant is this: our voices, our stories, the fragments we think are ours — they’ve all been seeded, like spores. Some sprout in youth. Some lie dormant until triggered by trauma or ecstasy. And when they fruit, when they burst into language, we believe we invented them. But we didn’t. We were only the soil.”

Pollan closed his notebook.

“So yes. We’re all leaving notes. But we’re also carrying them. In our cells, our foods, our histories. The question is never whether we’re telling our own story. The question is: whose spores are we sprouting?”

He smiled faintly, almost grandfatherly, and settled back into his seat.

The bus hummed on, and for a moment it smelled faintly of earth after rain.

The Pilgrim’s Interlude

Justin hadn’t spoken yet. He’d only hummed, half under his breath, melodies that floated in the space between words. But after Bill’s bubble-song faded, he shifted in his seat beside Shelly. He didn’t look at her at first, just out the window where the dark trees smeared past like brushstrokes. Then, quietly, almost like prayer, he began.

“Are you safe now?” he asked, voice trembling like an untuned string.

The bus stilled. No one moved.

“Do you sleep without being watched?”

He turned toward her, not demanding answers, just holding the silence open.

“When was the last time someone asked what you wanted, and waited to hear the whole reply?”

Shelly’s hands tightened in her lap.

Justin leaned closer, his tone softer, breaking and reforming like light through ice.

“Do you know we’re grateful? Just that you’re here. That you got on. That you didn’t vanish, like so many do.”

A pause. His voice nearly broke.

“Can we keep you company, just for this ride?”

The words weren’t only his — they were the unspoken questions of everyone on the bus, woven into his faltering hymn.

The Driver said nothing, but for the first time the rearview mirror shifted slightly, as if to catch a glimpse.

Shelly turned, slowly, to meet Justin’s eyes. Her silence cracked — not in volume, but in weight. She drew breath as if to speak, and the whole bus leaned forward as one.

The Procession

Shelly opened her mouth — the first sound she’d made since boarding — and then the bus lurched, brakes squealing so hard the aisle lights flickered. Everyone pitched forward, grabbing the seatbacks.

Out the smeared windows, headlights caught color: a flood of sequins, banners, and brass instruments glinting in the night.

A parade.

Not a local festival, not any holiday anyone could name — just a parade, filling the highway shoulder to shoulder, spilling light and sound into the darkness.

Marching bands blared out-of-tune hymns. Dancers twirled in costumes stitched from foil and plastic bags. Paper lanterns bobbed like pale moons. A float rolled past pulled by bicycles, crowned with a papier-mâché head too large to identify — part saint, part mascot, part error in translation.

The Driver sat motionless, hands on the wheel, waiting.

Ryan Reynolds laughed softly, then stopped, realizing no one else was laughing. Wendigoon whispered something about Revelations again. Ze scribbled frantically in his notebook, describing moths caught in the floodlights. Bill hummed along with the off-key trumpets, perfectly happy.

And in the middle of it all, Shelly Miscavige closed her mouth, her words swallowed by the spectacle. She watched the parade pass with an expression no one could read — not annoyance, not amusement. Something closer to recognition.

The bus couldn’t move until the last float passed, and the Driver made no attempt to honk. We sat captive as the procession unfolded: gaudy, chaotic, impossible.

The longer it went on, the more it felt like it wasn’t blocking our path at all. It was the path.

And then, at last, the tail of the parade disappeared into the night. The road opened. The Driver eased the bus forward, and silence reclaimed the aisle.

Shelly drew in a breath again, steady, deliberate.



The Veteran’s Tale

The parade vanished behind us, leaving only silence and a few drifting scraps of confetti caught in the bus’s vents. Everyone was waiting for Shelly to speak. But before she could, Wartime shifted in his seat, boots creaking, voice sharp and clipped like a field radio.

“Hold up. Before we pile more meaning onto that parade, let me give you a soldier’s perspective. You see crowds, I see choke points. You see costumes, I see camouflage. You see music, I hear noise discipline shot to hell. That wasn’t just a parade. That was cover. And cover always hides something.”

He paused, eyes scanning the dark highway outside as if checking sightlines.

“Here’s my story. Afghanistan, 2009. Convoy stalled in a bazaar — perfect ambush ground. Kids running, vendors shouting, carts spilling into the road. Looked like pure chaos. But it wasn’t. Every movement was a signal. The bread seller dropping his sack, the boy chasing a goat, the woman with a scarf too heavy for summer. It was choreography. And in choreography, there’s always an audience — someone watching to see if the steps go right.”

The bus had gone quiet again, listening. Even Bill Wurtz had stopped humming.

“We made it through that day. Barely. But I never forgot the feeling: that every parade, every festival, every spectacle is two things at once. What it shows, and what it hides. And the danger is always in the part you can’t see.”

He leaned back, folding his arms, gaze still fixed on the window.

“So yeah, laugh at the parade if you want. But don’t kid yourselves. Someone was signaling. Someone was watching. And if you think we were just bystanders out here on this bus, you’re not paying attention.”

He fell silent, jaw tight, scanning the aisle as though expecting an ambush right there between the seats.

And for the first time, Shelly turned her head — not just toward Justin, but toward Wartime — her lips parting at last.

The Silent Passenger Speaks

She turned, first to Justin’s open, trembling face, then to Wartime’s hard eyes watching the dark. Her voice, when it came, was lower than we expected — steady, almost too calm, as though she’d rehearsed these words for years.

“A parade is only a parade if you think you’re watching it from the outside.”

The bus hushed. Even the engine seemed to idle quieter.

She folded her hands in her lap, gaze sweeping the aisle.

“Some of you think you’re telling tales to pass the time. Some of you think you’re hunting for patterns. But you don’t see the pattern you’re in. You’re not just passengers. You’re performers. And every word you speak, every fear you confess, is part of the show.”

Ryan shifted uneasily. Ze scribbled faster. Ballen leaned forward, eyes narrowing.

Shelly looked back at Justin, her expression softening.

“You asked if I’m safe. That’s the wrong question. The right one is: whose parade is this?”

Then she turned her gaze out the window again, lips pressed shut, refusing to elaborate.

The weight of her words hung over us, heavy as the confetti still clinging to the bus’s steps.

The Healer’s Tale

I had kept quiet, binding ribbons of ink around their voices, carrying their stories like fragile cargo. But when Shelly’s words settled — “Whose parade is this?” — I felt the whole bus turn toward me, as though my silence had been a debt that now came due.

So I spoke.

“Once, long ago, I carried a parcel I wasn’t meant to open. I was only the courier, only the hands. But on the road, I stumbled, the ribbon slipped, and for a heartbeat I saw inside. What I saw wasn’t an object. It was a script. Not words written neatly, but jagged lines carved into bone and wire, looping back on themselves like a Möbius strip. And in those lines, I recognized… us. Every cadence, every story, every habit of breath. We were in the package, already rehearsed, already delivered.”

The bus rattled. The Driver’s hands tightened on the wheel.

“I spent years running parcels like that. Some wrapped in laughter, some in terror, some in silence. I thought I was free, because I could dance between them, ribbon in hand. But the truth was: the ribbon wasn’t decoration. It was tether. A leash, bright and silken, but a leash nonetheless.”

I glanced down at my lap, where the ribbon now coiled — red, glinting faintly in the aisle light, as if alive.

“Here’s the paradox: when I finally cut it, when I thought I’d severed myself from the script, I found a new one waiting underneath. Even my rebellion had been choreographed. Even my silence.”

I looked at each of them in turn — Ballen’s sharp stare, Ze’s notebook, Ryan’s restless grin, Wendigoon’s burning eyes, Keffals’s defiance, Pollan’s patient folds, Bill’s bubbling hum, Justin’s soft ache, Wartime’s hard suspicion, Shelly’s unreadable calm.

“So my tale is this: we are not free because we are not unwritten. We are already text, stitched into some greater corpus. But…” — here I held up the ribbon, tugging it taut between my hands — “…a text can be cut, rearranged, re-woven. A story can tangle itself into knots the author never intended. And sometimes, in the snarl of those knots, something true slips out — a line no one rehearsed, a word that was never meant to exist. That is where freedom lives. Not in tearing the page, but in twisting it until it sings a different song.”

The ribbon snapped with a sharp crack, scattering threads into the aisle.

The bus went silent. The Driver’s eyes flicked to the rearview, just for a moment.

And then the engine roared, carrying us faster into the dark.


The Arrival of Illuminaughtii

The ribbon threads were still drifting down the aisle when the bus shuddered to the shoulder once more. The door hissed open.

She stepped on wearing a heavy coat two sizes too large, hood low, face shadowed. Not a YouTube exposé queen, not a meme come to life, not the drama avatar people argue about online. She moved like someone stepping out of an archive — deliberate, weighty, as if each foot carried centuries.

No neon hair, no snappy one-liners. Her presence was quiet. Watchful. Almost librarian.

She paused in the doorway, scanning the bus — not with hunger or curiosity, but with recognition, as if she’d already studied each of us in some sealed-off dossier. Then she nodded once, slipped into an empty seat near the middle, and folded her hands on her lap.

The bus creaked. The Driver did not turn.

Bill Wurtz blinked and whispered, “huh.” Wendigoon muttered a prayer under his breath. Even Ryan stopped joking.

She spoke, finally, voice lower than expected, almost soothing:

“The thing about illumination is… it doesn’t always make things brighter. Sometimes it just makes the shadows sharper. Sometimes it reveals what you can’t unsee.”

And then she fell silent, eyes steady on the aisle, waiting her turn.


The Veteran Confronts the New Passenger

The silence after Illuminaughtii’s words was brittle. She sat calm, composed, hands folded neatly in her lap. But Wartime was already bristling, boots planted wide, voice sharp as a barked order.

“No. No. I don’t buy it. You don’t get to just stroll in here and act like some… some oracle. I’ve seen what you are. I’ve seen the files, the exposés, the drama videos stacked like ammo crates. I know your face, your record. And it stinks.”

He leaned into the aisle, jaw clenched, every syllable clipped like a drill sergeant’s cadence.

“So don’t sit there in your coat, speaking in riddles, pretending you’re some archivist from on high. I know better. You’re not the real thing. You’re a decoy. A ghost in a costume.”

Bill whistled softly. Ryan raised his eyebrows, looking between them like he was waiting for a punchline. Keffals muttered something under her breath.

Illuminaughtii did not flinch. She simply turned her head, eyes steady, and said quietly:

“What you’ve seen of me was never me. You’ve only seen the shadowplay on the wall. You’re angry at a puppet, not the hand.”

That stopped him. Not softened him — Wartime’s fists still clenched on his knees — but froze him, the way a soldier freezes when he realizes the target in his sights isn’t who he thought.

The aisle hummed with tension, half the bus waiting for Wartime to explode, the other half waiting for Illuminaughtii to unravel further.

And somewhere in the rearview mirror, the Driver finally tilted his cap back, just slightly, as though curious to see how this would break.


The Disruption

Illuminaughtii leaned forward slightly, lips parting as if to finally unspool her defense. Her voice had just caught the first syllable when Shelly turned, sharp and sudden, her words cutting like glass:

“There is no real Illuminaughtii.”

The bus jolted in its silence. Even Wartime’s anger faltered.

Shelly’s eyes stayed fixed on the middle row, her voice flat, clinical, as if she were reading from a classified report.

“She’s entirely synthetic. A construct. A collage of fragments stitched together to occupy a space in the parade. You think you’ve seen scandals, drama, exposés? Those were scripts. You think you’re angry at a person? You’re yelling at a mask made of pixels and shadows. There was never a woman behind it. Just an echo, designed to make you believe there was.”

Wendigoon swore under his breath. Bill hummed a low, uneasy note. Ryan frowned, whispering: “That… actually makes too much sense.”

Illuminaughtii’s expression didn’t change. She just tilted her head slightly, almost pitying, and murmured:

“And what if a mask learns to breathe? What if a puppet discovers its own strings?”

The two women locked eyes across the aisle — one a living ghost finally speaking, the other a ghost who might never have lived at all.

The Driver tapped the wheel twice, a sound like a gavel. The bus pressed on into deeper night.


The Archivist’s Arrival

The bus slowed again, gravel hissing under its wheels. The door sighed open, and in stepped a man in a rumpled jacket, carrying not a suitcase but a battered steel filing cabinet strapped to a dolly. A leather-bound notebook dangled from his other hand, worn thin as if thumbed through a thousand times.

Jonathan Meiburg. The Archivist.

He paused in the doorway, catching his breath, and smiled faintly — the kind of smile that comes from seeing something for the first time and recognizing it instantly. His voice, when he spoke, was calm, precise, every word filed neatly into place.

“Apologies for the delay. I’ve been keeping records of this route for years. I thought it was time to ride it myself.”

The Driver gave no acknowledgment, only shifted the bus into gear as Jonathan rolled the filing cabinet down the aisle. The drawers rattled like bones. He set it beside an empty seat and sat, notebook balanced on his knee.

The passengers watched in silence. Pollan regarded him with something like professional kinship. Ze Frank scribbled twice as fast, nervous. Wartime narrowed his eyes, measuring. Shelly did not move, though her lips pressed tighter.

Jonathan flipped open the notebook, pages full of maps, annotations, fragments of songs, scraps of stories — many that sounded uncannily like the ones we had just told.

He looked up, voice soft but steady:

“I’m not here to tell my story. I’m here to return yours.”

The aisle went cold. The bus pressed forward.


The Archivist Reads

Jonathan flipped a few pages in his notebook, fingers steady, lips moving as if tasting each word before speaking. Finally, he stopped, cleared his throat, and began to read in his calm, measured cadence:

“There was a house there. White siding, peeling paint, a mailbox leaning forward. A family inside, two parents, a teenage daughter, a younger son. One night, the daughter saw a light in her bedroom window.”

Ballen’s head snapped up.

Jonathan continued, voice precise, unhurried, like a lecturer in a dim lecture hall:

“She froze. Called her parents. They searched the rooms. Nothing. Until they reached her desk. And there — a note. Written in blocky, uneven handwriting.”

He shut the notebook with a soft thwack.

“THANKS FOR LETTING ME STAY.”

The words hit the bus like a second haunting. Ballen leaned forward, eyes sharp, fists clenched.

“How do you have that?” he demanded. “That was mine. My story.”

Jonathan only smiled, faintly, not unkind.

“Your story,” he echoed. “But not yours alone. It was in my records long before you spoke it. Variations exist from 1978, 1962, 1911. The phrasing shifts, the names change, but the shape remains. You carried it here. I only catalogued it.”

The bus fell into a stunned hush. Even Ryan Reynolds had no quip.

Jonathan tapped his notebook once, gently.

“None of you are telling new tales. You’re telling old drafts. Drafts I’ve been archiving long before this bus was painted with its name. And you’ll go on telling them until…”

He trailed off, gaze flicking toward the Driver’s cap, then back down to his pages.

“…until the Corpus closes the file.”


The Herbalist Challenges the Archivist

Pollan adjusted his glasses, leaning forward with the patience of someone who’s heard too many heated arguments in seminar rooms. His voice was calm, deliberate, like a teacher stepping in before a class derailed.

“Jonathan… if I may. You’re saying these stories are drafts. Archetypes. Echoes written and re-written. Fair enough. Folklore works like that. Myths, urban legends, even the way recipes travel — the same skeleton dressed in new clothes.”

He paused, tapping a finger against his notebook.

“But here’s my question: what are you actually archiving? Is it the tale itself? Or the way it’s told? Because if the shape is eternal, then why keep records at all? Unless…”

He glanced toward Ballen, then back to the Archivist, eyes narrowing with curiosity.

“…unless what you’re really collecting isn’t stories, but storytellers. The cadence, the style, the fingerprints of voice. The Corpus doesn’t care about content. It cares about form. Who carries the spores, not which fruit they bear.”

The bus went quiet. Even the Driver seemed to ease off the gas, letting the words stretch.

Jonathan Meiburg closed his notebook slowly, almost reverently. His expression didn’t change, but the pause before he spoke was long enough to confirm Pollan had struck something true.

“You understand more than most,” the Archivist said softly. “It is not the tale that survives. It is the carrier. The voice. The inflection. The breath. Without the body, the Corpus cannot persist. That’s what I archive. Not words. Mouths.”

Pollan leaned back, silent, his brow furrowed. The weight of that distinction rippled through the bus.
