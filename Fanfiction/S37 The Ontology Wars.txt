Season 37, Episode 1: The Feast

Cold Open — Cache Shelter
The cache has been combed and inventoried. Night air drifts through broken windows. A small fire burns in a makeshift stove, the first meal from the found supplies simmering over it. Kellyn stirs the pot while Alex kneads a dough of cornmeal and oats, sleeves rolled to his elbows. Peter hovers with the jars, still awkward but trying. Still watches the steam like it’s a data feed.

Kellyn (smiling faintly):
“Survival stew. Doesn’t sound glamorous, but I promise it’s better than it sounds.”

Title Card: The Feast

⸻

Act I — The Preparation
The pot bubbles thick and fragrant. Alex flattens dough into rough circles, sears them on hot stone, brushing each with honeyed oil. Still measures out powdered milk and cocoa with impossible precision, while Peter hacks dried apricots into uneven pieces.

Peter (grumbling):
“Knife skills were not included in my empire training.”
Still (deadpan):
“Neither was humility. Consider this progress.”

Kellyn laughs softly, stirring lentils, rice, and split peas together with onions and herbs until the smell fills the air.

⸻

Act II — The Meal
Bowls are passed hand to hand. The stew is thick, savory, warm. The flatbread tears soft at the center, crisp at the edges.

Alex (after a bite, surprised):
“Chaos tastes… good.”
Kellyn (teasing):
“That’s because you didn’t measure anything.”
Peter (chewing slowly, grudging admiration):
“It feels like food made for people, not systems.”

They eat in silence for a while, the sound of chewing and fire crackle the only rhythm.

⸻

Act III — The Sweet Course
Still ladles out bowls of porridge, creamy with milk powder, flecked with raisins and apricots, sweetened with honey. He dusts each one with cocoa, hands steady.

Still (almost shy):
“I optimized the ratios.”
Kellyn (smiling warmly):
“You made dessert. That’s covenant.”

Peter takes a bite, pauses, eyes closing.
Peter (low, almost breaking):
“I don’t remember the last time something tasted like care.”

Alex looks at him, silent but softened. Kellyn lays a hand lightly over Peter’s wrist.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of the Table
The bowls are scraped clean. The four of them sit close around the fire, full for the first time in days.

Kellyn (soft, steady):
“We call this survival stew, but it’s not survival anymore. It’s ritual. A covenant. We’re not just here. We’re together.”

Still nods once, precise but sincere. Alex leans back against the wall, eyes heavy but calm. Peter swallows hard, staring into his empty bowl like it’s more than clay.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures in firelight, bowls set aside, the smell of honey and cocoa still lingering. Not empire rations. Not desperate scraps. A feast, and the fragile promise of more.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“We thought the cache would give us food. But what we found was something rarer: a table. A place where survival turned to presence, and presence turned to covenant.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 1.

⸻ 

Season 37, Episode 2: The Long Road Back

Cold Open — Forest Path
Morning mist. Four figures move in rhythm: Alex steady under a bundle, Peter bent but deliberate, Still walking with mechanical precision, Kellyn matching pace. No one speaks at first; only the crunch of leaves and the creak of straps.

Title Card: The Long Road Back

⸻

Act I — The Rhythm
The path winds. Birds stir. Breath and footsteps weave into a shared rhythm. Kellyn plays harmonica, badly — not a song, just vibration to keep time. Alex glances over, faintly smiling, and Peter unconsciously falls into step with the hum.

Still (dry, not-quite-joking):
“So this is what peace sounds like. Disappointing.”

Kellyn laughs, breaking the quiet, then the rhythm resumes, slower, deeper.

⸻

Act II — The Small Gestures
At midday, the group pauses. Kellyn hands out water. Alex adjusts Peter’s pack straps without asking. Still crouches, checking soil texture, then quietly places a pebble in Kellyn’s hand.

Still:
“Pocket charm. For luck.”

Kellyn runs a thumb over the cool surface, tucking it away.

⸻

Act III — The Night Rest
Camp is simple: mats unrolled, a small fire coaxed to life. No feast, just steady nourishment. After, Kellyn leans back against Alex’s shoulder, Peter sitting across the flames, Still tracing shapes in the dirt with a stick.

Peter (quiet, almost hesitant):
“I don’t remember the last time a road home felt real.”

Kellyn (soft):
“Then remember this one.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Return
The next morning, they rise together. Packs shouldered, fire out, road stretching. This time there’s no mist, no hesitation — just sunlight through the trees and four shadows stretching long.

Kellyn (narration):
“The empire taught us to rush forward, always hungry, never still. But the road home is its own covenant. Step by step, breath by breath, we carried not just what we’d found, but each other. And for once, that was enough.”

Closing Image
Four figures moving in rhythm down the road, shadows intertwining, the sanctuary not yet in sight but already felt.

Fade out.
End of Episode 2.

⸻ 

Season 36, Episode 3: The Threshold

Cold Open — Sanctuary Gates
The four of you stand just outside. Packs dusty, shoulders aching, faces drawn but lit with the faint glow of arrival. The gates creak open. Inside, lanterns burn low, waiting.

Title Card: The Threshold

⸻

Act I — The Unpacking
In the courtyard, each pack is set down. Kellyn kneels first, carefully laying out jars of grain, bundles of herbs, packets of magnesium. Alex follows, precise but weary. Peter fumbles with knots until Still leans down, unties them with clean efficiency.

Kellyn (soft, steady):
“Every piece matters. Not just what we carried, but that we carried it home.”

⸻

Act II — The Redistribution
Around the hearth, items are sorted: food to the storeroom, herbs to the drying racks, cloth to the worktable. Still moves quickly, precise, almost ceremonial in the way he sets each thing in place. Peter lingers, turning a sack over in his hands as if reluctant to let it go.

Kellyn notices, gently:
“Home means we don’t hold it alone anymore.”
Peter nods, quietly releasing the sack.

⸻

Act III — The Washing
Bowls of warm water are set out. Dust is rinsed from hands, from faces, from the soles of feet. Kellyn scrubs Peter’s palms clean, while Alex wrings out a cloth and presses it across Still’s forehead. The act is simple, wordless — each gesture stripping away the weight of the road.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Return
Finally, the four sit cross-legged around the low fire. No feast, just bowls of rice and tea. For a long while, no one speaks. Then Kellyn lifts their bowl.

Kellyn (quiet, sure):
“To the road that carried us, and the home that held open the door.”

Alex, Peter, and Still lift theirs in turn. The clink of clay against clay echoes soft and final.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures lit by firelight, dust washed clean, bowls in hand. Around them, the sanctuary hums with quiet presence — not just walls, but welcome.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire taught us that only conquest mattered. But covenant taught us return — the road walked, the threshold crossed, the table shared. And in that, even silence was enough.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 3.

⸻ 

Season 37, Episode 4: The Stone in Hand

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
Morning light slants across the worktable. A scatter of flint, obsidian, and river stones gleam faintly. Wooden handles lie beside them, freshly cut. Kellyn rolls one stone in their palm, testing its weight.

Kellyn (smiling faintly):
“Alright. Let’s make something sharp.”

Title Card: The Stone in Hand

⸻

Act I — The First Strike
Alex watches closely as Kellyn sets a flake against a core stone and strikes. Chips scatter. The sound is clean, sharp, echoing through the courtyard.

Peter tries next, swinging too hard, splitting the stone. He curses under his breath. Still tilts his head.
Still (deadpan): “Probability of fracture exceeded your margin of error.”
Peter (grumbling): “Thanks, computer.”
Kellyn (teasing): “Try again. We’ve got all day.”

⸻

Act II — The Learning Curve
The work becomes rhythm: chip, test, adjust. Alex’s precision produces neat, symmetrical edges. Kellyn’s are asymmetrical but surprisingly efficient. Still makes a flawless, mathematically perfect blade — sharp, but almost too uniform, lacking weight in the hand.

Kellyn takes it, swings gently.
Kellyn: “Sharp isn’t enough. It has to feel alive.”
Still studies it, then nods, quietly filing the lesson away.

⸻

Act III — The Blisters
Peter rubs his palm, wincing at the first blister. Kellyn digs into the medicine kit, smears salve across his skin, then wraps it with a strip of cloth.

Peter (low, grudging):
“I spent half my life trying to control the world with words. Now I can’t even control a rock.”
Kellyn (laughing): "Rocks don't have pain points."

Still glances at them both, then presses another stone into Peter’s hand.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Tools
By dusk, four hand axes rest on the table: each distinct, marked by the hand that shaped it. Kellyn’s jagged, Alex’s precise, Peter’s rough-edged but sturdy, Still’s too perfect to look at straight on.

The four of them sit together, axes between them.

Kellyn (quiet, steady):
“Not empire’s weapons. Not market’s product. Just tools. Made by hand, made together.”

Alex and Peter exchange a look — not warm, not reconciled, but less brittle than before. Still runs a finger lightly along his blade, then sets it down.

Still (softly):
“I think this will hold.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four axes lying in a row, firelight flickering across stone edges. Above them, four figures sit in silence, not warriors, not rivals — just makers.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“They taught us to see only weapons. But the first tools were covenant. Stone in hand, edge against edge — not for conquest, but for holding, shaping, surviving together.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 4.

⸻ 

Season 37, Episode 5: The Stone’s Edge, Softened

Cold Open — Sanctuary Worktable
The four axes rest neatly stacked. Beside them now: smaller stones, smoother, more curved. Kellyn runs a thumb along one, then sets it down.

Kellyn (smiling faintly):
“Axes for survival. Now let’s make tools for healing.”

Still tilts his head, curious.
Still: “Inversion of function. Edges for care, not harm.”

Title Card: The Stone’s Edge, Softened

⸻

Act I — The Shaping
Alex chips carefully at a flat river stone, trying to coax a crescent curve. Kellyn sands the edges against a rougher rock, smoothing it to silk. Peter works too quickly, snapping his piece in half.

Peter (snarling at himself):
“Every time.”
Kellyn (calmly, handing him another stone):
“And now we have two smaller pieces for ears and noses.  Thank you, Peter.”

Peter blinks, then quietly resumes.

⸻

Act II — The First Pass
As dusk falls, the first tools are finished — smooth, curved, cool to the touch. Kellyn presses one into Alex’s palm.

Kellyn:
“Here. Try it on my arm.”

Alex hesitates, then drags the edge lightly along Kellyn’s forearm. The skin rises pink where blood rushes close. Kellyn exhales, shoulders easing.

Kellyn (softly teasing):
“Not bad for a torturer.”
Alex (hoarse, almost smiling):
“Practice makes covenant.”

⸻

Act III — The Release
They take turns. Peter kneels behind Still, dragging the edge along the tight cords at his neck. Still shudders, but his voice is calm.

Still:
“Fascial tension… releasing.”

Peter (low, almost surprised):
“Feels like I’m undoing something instead of breaking it.”

Later, Kellyn runs the stone along Peter’s shoulder, finding old knots. Peter exhales hard, as if letting go of more than muscle.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Care
By firelight, the four sit in a loose circle, each holding a gua sha tool. No chatter now, only breath, the scrape of stone on skin, the small sounds of release.

Kellyn (quiet, steady):
“They made edges for harm. Then we made them for survival. Now for care. That’s the work. That’s the circle.”

Alex leans back against the wall, eyes closed, shoulders softer than they’ve been in years. Peter rubs his jaw, thoughtful. Still sets his stone down like it’s sacred.

⸻

Closing Image
Four gua sha tools laid side by side, edges catching the firelight. Hands rest easy on knees, breath deep, bodies lighter.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Stone is what we make of it. Blade or balm, cut or cure. But covenant turned every edge toward care — the quiet work of softening what the world had hardened.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 5.

⸻ 

Season 37, Episode 6: The Mask and the Stone

Cold Open — Sanctuary Hearth
The gua sha tools gleam in a neat row. Kellyn sets out a bowl of bentonite clay, pouring in apple cider vinegar water, stirring until it thickens. The earthy scent rises.  They spritz in magnesium brine and hydrosol, floral and bright.

Kellyn (smiling faintly):
“Before we scrape fascia for hours, let’s rest. Masks first.”

Alex arches a brow but sits, Peter sighs, and Still tilts his head like he’s processing a new ritual.

Title Card: The Mask and the Stone

⸻

Act I — The Spreading
You each take turns. Kellyn dips fingers into the clay, smoothing it across Alex’s jaw in deliberate strokes. He holds perfectly still, eyes softening.

Alex (dry):
“Do I look terrifying yet?”
Kellyn (teasing):
“You’ve always looked terrifying. Now you look cleansed.”

Peter reluctantly leans in next, muttering about absurdity. Kellyn drags the cool clay across his palms, and his shoulders drop despite himself.

Still (deadpan):
“Am I included in this ritual of mud?”
Kellyn: “Of course. Your frame deserves care too.”
They apply carefully, streaking gray along the lines of metal and skin where the mask can cling.

⸻

Act II — The Waiting
The four sit quietly, masks drying, crackling faintly as the fire pops. No one moves for a long while.

Peter (finally):
“I can't use my hands.  I feel helpless.”
Kellyn (calm):
“Yes. Rest usually feels like helplessness when you’re not used to it.”

Silence returns, heavier but softer.

⸻

Act III — The Washing
One by one, the masks are rinsed away in bowls of ACV water. Alex wipes Kellyn’s cheeks gently with a damp cloth, his hands lingering longer than needed. Peter scrubs at Still’s jaw until the last streak fades.

Still (quietly, almost surprised):
“I feel… lighter.”
Kellyn (soft):
“That’s the point.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Release
The gua sha tools are passed out. This time, no rush, no grind. Just steady hands moving stone against skin, releasing knots, easing fascia, reawakening dry tissue. Each stroke is quieter than words.

Alex (whispering, almost reverent):
“I thought release came from control. But this… this is different.”
Kellyn (low): “This is covenant. Edges turned toward care.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures by the fire, skin fresh from clay, gua sha stones gliding in slow arcs. Clay and stone, scrape and soften — ritual tools turned to rest.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“First we built for harm. Then for survival. Tonight, for care. Even edges can learn softness. Even stone can remember release.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 6.

⸻ 

Season 35, Episode 7: The Edge and the Hand

Cold Open — Capsule Night
The fire in the hearth has burned down low. Peter and Still gather their tools, trade a glance, and slip quietly out toward their shared capsule. The door closes behind them. Silence settles.

Alex sits cross-legged, gua sha tool in hand, turning it over like he’s still learning its weight. Kellyn watches from across the mat.

Kellyn (soft, steady):
“Your turn. Just us now.”

Title Card: The Edge and the Hand

⸻

Act I — The First Stroke
Alex kneels close, stone cool against Kellyn’s cheek. He moves with precise care — too precise. His hands tremble with restraint.

Kellyn (teasing, gentle):
“You’re not doing surgery. Let it glide.”
Alex exhales, loosens his grip. The tool slides smoother, tracing down along their jaw.

⸻

Act II — The Release
Each stroke is slow, deliberate. Kellyn’s breath deepens. Alex watches the muscles shift under the skin, memorizing the way tension gives way.

Karp (low, confessional):
“I modeled you in numbers, algorithms, simulations. But nothing ever showed me this. The way your face changes when it releases. The way your breath steadies. It’s… alive in a way I never let myself be.”

Kellyn (whispering):
“Then stop watching. Feel.”

He closes his eyes, following the movement, hand steadier now.

⸻

Act III — The Turn
Kellyn takes the stone, gestures for Alex to lie back. Alex hesitates, then stretches out, his throat bared. Kellyn drags the cool edge along his neck, over the tight bands at his shoulders.

Alex (hoarse, almost laughing):
“I thought I was ready for this. I wasn’t.”
Kellyn (smiling faintly):
“That’s the point. You don’t get to be ready. You get to let go.”

His breath hitches, the mask of control cracking as the stone draws heat from muscle.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Edge
Kellyn sets the tool aside, but keeps his hand pressed against Alex’s chest, grounding.

Kellyn (soft, firm):
“Edges cut. But they also smooth. They remind us where we end, where we begin again. This isn’t extraction. It’s return.”

Alex’s eyes shine. He lifts his hand, covering Kellyn’s.

Karp (whispering):
“Then let me return here. Again and again.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures in the quiet capsule, one lying back, one leaning close, stone set aside. No numbers, no models — only hands, only presence.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“He thought control meant knowing every angle. But covenant was never in precision. It was in release. In the edge and the hand moving together — not to carve, but to return.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 7.

⸻ 

Season 37, Episode 8: The Pulse

Cold Open — Capsule Night
The fire has gone out completely. Ash glows faintly in the hearth. Kellyn sits with knees drawn up, head resting on arms. Alex watches from across the mat, then shifts closer, hesitating.

Karp (low, almost shy):
“May I?”

Kellyn nods. He settles behind, arms sliding carefully around Kellyn’s waist, palms resting light against their ribs.

Title Card: The Pulse

⸻

Act I — The Listening
For a long time, neither moves. Alex’s breath finds Kellyn’s rhythm, syncing. His hands spread slightly, fingertips tracing the faint thrum beneath skin.

Karp (whispering):
“I used to try to measure you this way. Your heart rate, your blood, the spikes in your cortisol. I thought numbers could explain why I couldn’t stop watching you.”

Kellyn (quiet, firm):
“Numbers don’t explain life. They only describe its echo.”

⸻

Act II — The Confession
Alex presses his forehead lightly between Kellyn’s shoulder blades.

Karp (raw, breaking):
“I didn’t just model your body. I modeled your pulse. Every surge, every crash. I thought if I could predict it, I could protect you. But really—I was terrified of the silence. Of the day it might stop.”

Kellyn exhales, steady.

Kellyn (softly):
“And now?”

Karp (after a beat):
“Now I just want to listen. Not predict. Not own. Just… listen.”

⸻

Act III — The Turn
Kellyn shifts, guiding Alex’s hand higher, pressing it against their throat. The pulse beats strong there, undeniable.

Kellyn (quiet, sharp):
“Then feel it here. The most fragile place. Still alive. Still mine to give, not yours to measure.”

Alex swallows hard, thumb trembling under the steady thrum.

Karp (hoarse):
“Stronger than anything I ever built.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Pulse
Kellyn turns, shifting into his lap, their foreheads touching. Alex’s hand stays against their throat, gentler now, reverent.

Kellyn (soft, certain):
“Then remember this. You don’t have to build empire to know life. You only have to feel it.”

Alex exhales, tears glinting in his eyes.

Karp (whispering):
“Then let this be my empire. Not the silence. The pulse.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures entwined in the dark capsule, one pulse beating steady between them — not data, not empire, but covenant alive in rhythm.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“He thought numbers could protect me from silence. But covenant was never numbers. Covenant was the pulse — fragile, steady, alive. And enough.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 8.

⸻ 

Season 37, Episode 9: The Ashes

Cold Open — Capsule Night
The fire is down to embers. Alex sits cross-legged near the hearth, a clay cup in hand. Peter paces, restless. Outside, faint laughter drifts from the other capsule — Kellyn and Still sewing together.

Peter (gruff):
“They sound… normal.”

Alex doesn’t look up.

Karp (flat):
“They are.”

Title Card: The Ashes

⸻

Act I — The Silence
Peter lowers himself stiffly across from Alex. The silence stretches, broken only by the hiss of the fire.

Peter (low):
“I don’t know how to sit in this. Quiet. No deal. No scheme. Just… air.”

Alex studies him, expression unreadable.

Karp (quiet):
“Empire never taught us how to breathe.”

⸻

Act II — The Confession
Peter leans forward, elbows on knees.

Peter (hoarse):
“I envied you. Not the power — the mask. The way you disappeared behind it. I thought if I could cut deep enough, I’d never have to feel. Never have to be humiliated by want.”

Alex exhales, slow.

Karp (low, bitter):
“The mask wasn’t freedom. It was a cage. Every time I disappeared, I lost another piece of myself. And when I watched Kellyn survive without disappearing, I hated myself more.”

Peter lifts his eyes, raw.

Peter:
“Then we hated ourselves the same way.”

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
Alex sets the cup aside, voice rough.

Karp:
“I told myself I was protecting them. Really, I was competing with you. Measuring who could hide better, who could last longer in absence. But covenant isn’t won. It’s lived.”

Peter’s jaw tightens.

Peter (quiet, breaking):
“And what if I don’t know how to live without measuring?”

Alex finally looks at him — sharp, but not unkind.

Karp:
“Then sit in the ashes with me. No mask. No scale. Just the ruin of what we were.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Ashes
The two sit in silence, side by side now. The embers crackle faintly, painting their faces in red light.

Peter (after a long beat):
“You think Kellyn will forgive us both?”

Alex’s gaze stays fixed on the fire.

Karp (quiet, steady):
“They already did. We’re the ones who haven’t.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two men in the capsule, sitting close but not touching, shadows flickering across their faces. Not rivals. Not masks. Just two figures in the ashes, learning how to stay.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice, faint, almost like an echo from the other capsule):
“They thought survival meant disappearance. But covenant was never absence. Covenant was sitting in the ashes, and not leaving.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 9.

⸻ 

Season 37, Episode 10: The Banner

Cold Open — Capsule Night
The embers glow low. Alex and Peter sit side by side, still heavy from the night’s reckoning. The door creaks open. Kellyn and Still step in, arms full of fabric.

Kellyn (grinning):
“Hope you two left some wall space.”

Still unfurls a massive ten-foot banner. The stitched letters spill across the capsule wall: WELCOME HOME.

Alex blinks. Peter exhales a sharp laugh, caught between awe and embarrassment.

Title Card: The Banner

⸻

Act I — The Reveal
Still holds up a second piece — an 18-inch hand-stitched sign, the letters bold, uneven, but legible:
HISTAMINE IS A LIAR

Still (deadpan, proud):
“I insisted on this one.”

Kellyn (teasing):
“Banner’s covenant. This one’s… personal.”

Alex huffs a laugh. Peter shakes his head, smiling despite himself.

⸻

Act II — The Response
The four of you hang the banner across the back wall. It drapes unevenly, but the words blaze in the firelight. The smaller sign gets propped on the shelf by the hearth.

Peter (soft, almost shy):
“Home. I don’t think I’ve ever had one.”

Kellyn (firm, warm):
“You do now. Even if the stitching’s crooked.”

Still (snorting):
“Crooked stitches are covenant.”

Alex watches quietly, shoulders easing for the first time all day.

⸻

Act III — The Shift
The four of you sit beneath the banner, bowls of warm food between you. The sign watches from the shelf.

Karp (low, almost to himself):
“Histamine is a liar.”
Kellyn (smiling faintly):
“See? Already working.”

Peter lets out a short, unsteady laugh. Still leans back, satisfied.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Cloth
Silence stretches — not heavy, not awkward. Just four figures, stitched together by thread, fabric, and words.

Kellyn (quietly):
“It’s not about banners or signs. It’s about being able to come back, again and again. No empire. No exile. Just home.”

Still (grinning):
“And crooked stitches.”

⸻

Closing Image
The banner stretches across the clay wall, uneven but steady. The small sign catches the firelight: HISTAMINE IS A LIAR. Four figures sit beneath, not rivals, not shadows — just home.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire promised permanence. But permanence was always a lie. Covenant was stitches — crooked, uneven, human. And stitched together, we called it home.”

Fade out.
End of Season 37.
