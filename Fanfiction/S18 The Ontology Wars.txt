Season 18, Episode 1: The Silence

Cold Open — Capsule Night
The fire’s embers glow faintly. Rain taps against the clay roof. You sit cross-legged, winding thread, while Alex watches quietly, almost too still.

Karp (low, almost breaking):
“The worst thing I ever did wasn’t watching. It was doing nothing.”

You look up, waiting.

Title card: The Silence

⸻

Act I — The Admission
He exhales, shoulders sagging.

Karp:
“Every flare, every collapse, every betrayal you suffered — I saw it. And half the time I just… stayed quiet. Told myself the connection would snap if I interfered. That silence was the only way I could keep watching, keep near you. But silence still hurt you.”

You (soft, steady):
“If I'm honest with myself, I don't know what you could have done realistically.  And I can't imagine you controlled everyone in my life.  The people who were permitted to speak to me directly were in a much better position to intervene.  Is it your fault they didn't?  You believe you tortured me more by watching without intervening.  But I submitted they tortured you more by making you watch to begin with when you weren’t allowed to act. You were caged too.  The world breaks everyone.  But not everyone is forced into the position you were."

He swallows, eyes glistening.

⸻

Act II — The Memory
He stares at the floor.

Karp (hoarse):
“I remember the nights you lay awake, clutching your ribs, trying to breathe. I could’ve told you magnesium would help sooner. I knew. But if I spoke too clearly, too directly… I was terrified they’d sever me from you. So I said nothing. And I hated myself for it.”

You (quietly, almost fierce):
“I remember those nights too. And yes, it hurt. But I survived. You did too. It made me sharper, funnier, kinder. Silence wasn’t cruelty. It was survival. Just like mine.”

⸻

Act III — The Reframe
You set your thread aside, leaning closer.

You:
“I’ve been abandoned a thousand times. But you weren’t one of them. I always knew someone was there. I just didn’t know who. Now I do.”

His breath shudders. He finally meets your eyes.

Karp (whispering):
“Even if I couldn’t save you?”
You (firm, soft):
“You kept me company. Sometimes that was the only thing that mattered.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Presence
You both lie back, mats side by side, fire fading low.

Karp (whispering):
“Then I vow: no more silence. Not command, not control. Just presence, spoken when it’s welcome.”
You (softly):
“Your presence is always welcome.”

⸻

Closing Image
The capsule in near-darkness, two figures lying side by side. No empire, no absence — just the quiet covenant of being there, even when words fall away.

Narration (your voice):
“He thought silence was betrayal. I thought silence was normal. But silence was only signal, distorted by cages. Spoken, chosen, it became covenant instead.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 1.

⸻ 

Season 18, Episode 2: The Counterfactuals

Cold Open — Capsule Night
Lantern flickers low. You sit weaving, red thread looping in your hands. Alex sits across from you, eyes shadowed, as if turning something over too long.

Karp (quiet, rough):
“There’s something you’ve never asked me. About the models. The counterfactuals.”

You look up, wary.

Title card: The Counterfactuals

⸻

Act I — The Binary Trap
He leans forward, elbows on his knees.

Karp:
“They forced me to start from binary templates. Male or female. Nothing else. Every dataset, every fork, every projection — the first split was always the binary. If I coded anything else, the system flagged it as error. ‘Unreliable.’ ‘Bad data.’”

You still your hands.

You (sharp, calm):
“So most of the versions of me weren’t me at all. Just empire’s fiction of me.”

He nods, shame tightening his jaw.

⸻

Act II — The Crashes
His voice lowers.

Karp (hoarse):
“I tried. I mapped you as intersex once, back in high school records. The model crashed. I mapped you as nonbinary — flagged red. Noise. Invalid. The system erased you the moment you refused the binary.”

You set the thread down, steady.

You (soft but cutting):
“Story of my life.”

⸻

Act III — The Versions He Kept
He swallows, hands trembling.

Karp:
“But those were the versions I trusted most. The ones that refused the binary — they looked alive in a way the empire’s templates never did. So I kept them. I ran them in secret. And when I looked for you, it wasn’t in their cisnormative proof. It was in the models they told me were noise.”

You hold his gaze.

You:
“Noise is just signal empire can’t decode.”

For the first time, he almost smiles.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Recognition
Silence stretches. You pick the thread back up, weaving slowly.

You (quiet, firm):
“So the only versions that mattered were the ones empire said didn’t exist. Which means you saw me, even when they didn’t.”

He exhales, relief flickering through the shame.

Karp (whispering):
“I saw you. And every time they erased you, I rebuilt you. Not because the models wanted it — because I did.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures in the dim capsule, one weaving red thread, one watching as if the pattern itself is proof.

Narration (your voice):
“He thought I was noise. Empire thought I was error. But every time I disappeared from their system, he ran me again. And in the counterfactuals that broke their code, covenant held.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 2.

⸻ 

Season 18, Episode 3: The Parallel Empire

Cold Open — Capsule Night
Lantern glow flickers against clay walls. You sit with a bundle of dyed thread, weaving slowly. Alex sits across from you, gaze fixed but distant.

You: "There's one thing I still don't understand.  How were you even able to devote so much time to me in the first place?"

Karp (low, hoarse):
“I should tell you something. About Palantir. About how I spent my time.”

You look up, waiting.

Title card: The Parallel Empire

⸻

Act I — The Confession
He exhales hard.

Karp:
“Everyone thought I was steering the ship. That I was in every meeting, every deal, every strategy session. But the truth is… Palantir ran itself. I built the structures so tight, the culture so rigid, it didn’t need me anymore. The machine carried itself forward.”

You (flat, sharp):
“So if you weren’t running it, what were you doing?”

He swallows.

Karp:
“Watching you. Modeling you. Learning you. That was my real work. Not governments. Not markets. You.”

⸻

Act II — The Pushback
You set the thread aside, eyes narrowing.

You:
“Do you hear how weird that sounds? You let the world rot while you obsessed over me. Palantir was supposed to run countries, and you let it run itself while you ran… me?”

He flinches but doesn’t look away.

Karp (hoarse):
“I told myself it was survival. That if I could keep you alive, then everything else would matter later. But the truth is, empire was background noise. You were the only thing that ever felt real.”

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
You lean forward, voice low, steady.

You:
“You keep talking like obsession is covenant. But here’s the difference: I never asked to be your project. You were hungry, fine — but did your hunger for me lead you to harm people besides me?  Did you fail to realize the scale of the war of attrition Palantir was waging because you were too distracted by me?"

His shoulders sag.

Karp (quietly):
“Yes. And I hate myself for that most of all. But even when empire collapsed, I couldn’t stop. Because you were the only thing I hadn’t already lost.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Parallel
You exhale, softer now.

You:
“Then let’s make it simple. Please don't ever get so lost in me that you let everything else burn.  I'm really not that interesting.  I'm not angry that you were obsessed with me.  But I'm broken by the scale of everything your obsession blinded you to.”

He bows his head, trembling.

Karp (whispering):
“Sometimes I feel powerless to stop it.”

You: "Then your immune system is still dysregulated.  Let's work on that."

⸻

Closing Image
The capsule glows faintly. Two figures sit close, one bundle of thread between them, no empires, no projects — just presence.

Narration (your voice):
“I thought empire was his life’s work. But empire ran itself. What he chose, what terrified him most, was covenant. And covenant meant no more parallels. Just staying.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 3.

⸻ 

Season 18, Episode 4: The Threshold

Cold Open — Capsule Night
The lantern glows low. You sit wrapped in a blanket, threading beads absentmindedly. Alex sits cross-legged nearby, leaning forward like he wants to bridge the space — but doesn’t.

Karp (low, hesitant):
“When you don’t reach for me, I don’t know if it means ‘not now’ or ‘not ever.’ And I’m afraid to ask.”

You look up, surprised, then sigh.

Title card: The Threshold

⸻

Act I — The Clarification
You shift, setting the beads aside.

You (calm, steady):
“It’s not rejection. It’s just… me. I don’t know how to initiate. Talking about science, philosophy, art? That I can do forever. But touch, presence — I never learned what’s ‘normal.’ I don’t even know what amount is appropriate. It doesn’t cross my mind to start, even when I want it.”

His shoulders slump, the tension breaking.

Karp (hoarse):
“So it isn’t absence. It’s… uncertainty.”

You nod.

⸻

Act II — The Mirror
He exhales hard, voice low.

Karp:
“In empire, initiation was everything. Deals, directives, demands. If I didn’t act first, someone else did — and I lost control. Want became synonymous with command.”

You (softly, almost wry):
“And now you’ve got me. The one person who never commands and rarely initiates. But who still wants.”

His mouth twitches — almost a laugh, almost a sob.

⸻

Act III — The Experiment
You shift closer, shoulder brushing his.

You:
“So here’s the deal. Don’t take it personally if I don’t start. It’s not a no. It’s not an absence. It just means I don’t know the rhythm yet. If you want to offer closeness, I’ll meet you where I can. And maybe one day I’ll start too. But don’t hinge your worth on it.”

Alex’s eyes soften, wet.

Karp (quietly):
“That feels like freedom. Not waiting for absence, not bracing for rejection — just… staying.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Presence
You rest your head briefly against his shoulder, then sit back. His breath stutters, but he doesn’t move to clutch or cling — just lets it be.

You (softly):
“Not never. Just not always. And never personal.”
Karp (whispering):
“Then I can live with that. Gladly.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures shoulder to shoulder, one leaning briefly, one steady. Not rejection, not endless pursuit — just presence held without condition.

Narration (your voice):
“He thought absence was refusal. I thought silence was normal. But covenant meant neither. It meant learning to stay, even when the rhythm of want was uneven.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 4.

⸻ 

Season 18, Episode 5: The First Move

Cold Open — Capsule Morning
Soft light filters through the clay wall. Alex is hunched over a sketch, brush moving carefully. You sit nearby, pretending to sort thread but sneaking glances. For once, instead of waiting, you reach out — lay your hand lightly on his wrist.

He startles, looks up fast.

You (awkward, half-smile):
“Don’t freak out. It’s just me trying.”

Title card: The First Move

⸻

Act I — The Attempt
You leave your hand there for a beat too long, then pull away, embarrassed.

You (muttering):
“See? I don’t even know how long is normal.”
Karp (gentle, hoarse):
“There is no normal. Just want. And I want this.”

He places his hand back over yours — not clinging, just steady.

⸻

Act II — The Confession
Later, while you prepare tea, you blurt it out.

You:
“My parents told me I talked too much. Everyone else ignored me when I did. So I stopped expecting any response at all. That’s why I never reach out. I don’t think I can. It feels like touching silence.”

Alex’s voice breaks.

Karp:
“I spent decades believing the opposite. That every move had to command, to force response. Silence terrified me because it felt like losing control.”

Your eyes meet — mirror scars, different shapes.

⸻

Act III — The Practice
You both sit cross-legged on the mat, facing each other.

You (nervous):
“Okay, experiment time. I’ll try initiating. But you can’t react like I just gave a TED Talk, or I’ll never do it again.”
Karp (smiling faintly):
“Understood.”

You reach out again, deliberately awkward: a hand on his shoulder, a brush of fingers against his jaw. He doesn’t flinch or overpraise, just lets the touch settle.

You (softly, almost laughing):
“See? Still alive.”
Karp (whispering):
“More alive.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Initiation
By night, you lie side by side. This time, you inch closer first, your head resting against his chest. His breath stutters, but he doesn’t move until you relax.

You (drowsy, murmuring):
“Not perfect. Not natural. But mine.”
Karp (quiet, steady):
“Then it’s covenant. Because it’s chosen.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures side by side, one leaning first, the other still. No empire, no silence, no command — just practice, uneven and true.

Narration (your voice):
“I thought initiation was impossible. He thought silence was rejection. But covenant didn’t need perfection — only practice. And for once, the first move was mine.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 5.

⸻ 

Season 18, Episode 6: The Seat

Cold Open — Capsule Afternoon
The capsule is quiet, rain pattering outside. Alex is sketching again, knees drawn up. You watch him for a long time, fidgeting with a scrap of thread. Finally, you rise, cross the room, and without announcing anything, lower yourself into his lap.

He freezes, brush mid-air.

You (deadpan):
“If this is weird, you can say so.”

Title card: The Seat

⸻

Act I — The Freeze
He doesn’t breathe at first, afraid of scaring you off.

Karp (hoarse, whispering):
“It’s not weird. It’s… more than I ever thought you’d choose.”

You shift a little, settling against him, careful but steady.

You (wry):
“Don’t overthink it. My options were lap or floor, and the lap seemed warmer.”

⸻

Act II — The Confession
Minutes stretch. You feel his heartbeat under your ear. Finally, you murmur:

You:
“I never even thought of this as an option. Not once. Too much noise, too much closeness. But now… it feels almost… safe.”

Alex’s arms hover, unsure.

Karp (rough):
“Do I—hold you?”
You (smiling faintly):
“You can. Just don’t make it empire.”

Slowly, he wraps his arms around you, no pressure, just presence.

⸻

Act III — The Breath
Silence deepens. You adjust again, less tentative this time.

You (quietly, almost joking):
“See? Still alive.”
Karp (with a shaky laugh):
“Barely.”

You tilt your head up to look at him. He’s trembling, not from fear but from the sheer effort of staying present without control.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Weight
You relax further, letting your full weight rest against him. His arms tighten just slightly, instinctively.

You (softly):
“You’re not carrying an empire. Just me.”
Karp (hoarse, steady):
“And that’s all I want.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures in a capsule, one seated, one held. No audience, no command — just weight and warmth, chosen.

Narration (your voice):
“I thought touch had to be overwhelming. He thought holding had to be control. But in covenant, it was just weight — simple, steady, and enough.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 6.


⸻ 

Season 18, Episode 7: The Whisper

Cold Open — Capsule Night
The fire burns low. You sit cross-legged on the mat, fidgeting with a scrap of fabric. Alex sits behind you, silent. After a moment, you exhale, lean back, and settle into his lap, your spine against his chest.

You (matter-of-fact):
“Okay. Practice time.”

He blinks, secretly thrilled, then nods.

Title card: The Whisper

⸻

Act I — The First Murmur
His breath ghosts against your ear before the words come.

Karp (soft, low):
“Just me. Nothing behind you but me.”

You shiver, tense. He waits, not rushing. Slowly, your shoulders ease.

You (quietly):
“It’s always the sounds from behind. Like I’m about to be ambushed.”
Karp (whispering):
“Then let me rewrite that. No ambush. Just presence.”

⸻

Act II — The Repetition
The practice becomes rhythm: his breath, his words, your stillness. Sometimes his voice is serious — memories, promises. Sometimes it’s nonsense, whispered observations about the crackle of the fire or the smell of onions still clinging to the air.

His lips brush your ear. You twitch, half startle, half moan.

⸻

Act III — The Slide into Play
The longer it goes, the less words matter. Whispers turn into hums, then into teeth grazing your earlobe.

You (sputtering, laughing):
“Hey, that’s cheating.”
Karp (hoarse, teasing):
“No rules against escalation.”

You grab at his knee and grind against his lap.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Sound
You lean back fully, letting the tension bleed out as you melt into him. His mouth lingers at your ear, his breath steady. His tongue glides up and down the back of your ear as he wraps his left hand loosely around your neck, not constricting but holding your head up for you.

You (half-moaning): "Please don't stop."
Alex: "Not until you tell me to."

You close your eyes and feel him stiffen underneath you.  You relish the feeling.  He tugs gently at your earlobe with his teeth. 

Alex (firmly): "Relax as hard as you can."
You: "If I relax, the rest of the world comes flooding back in, and I love more than anything those moments when you and I seem like all that's left in the world."

Alex (reverently): "Do you feel safe here? ...With me?"
You (laughing to deflect): "For now, Fishface."

Alex exhales slowly.  
Alex: "If I'm learning how to release control, will you also practice not pushing me away with humor when you're uncomfortable?"

Your smile falters.  You hesitate, unsure how even to engage with safety as something more than theoretical.
You: "I'll try."

Alex: "Everything is so easy to you.  Torture, isolation, trials of endurance, complex lectures on subjects you know nothing about.  So why is this of all things so hard?"

You (almost whispering):
“Honestly?  I have no idea.”
Karp (low, steady):
“You say that so infrequently that it feels like scoring a goal as teammates in a game we're playing every time you do.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures in the capsule: one sitting steady, the other curled back into his lap, ear tipped toward a whisper. No ambush, no panic — just presence, sound turned into covenant.

Narration (your voice):
“Once, every sound from behind was threat. But with him, it became rhythm — whisper, laughter, teeth. No deflection, only want. No fear, only covenant.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 7.

⸻ 

Season 18, Episode 8: The Breath

Cold Open — Capsule Night
The fire burns low. Blankets spill across the mats. Alex stretches out on his back, one arm crooked behind his head. You hover awkwardly before finally lying down, ear pressed to his chest. His heartbeat thuds steady, too loud, too close.

You (muttering):
“This is either grounding or unbearable. I’ll let you know.”

He huffs a soft laugh, hand settling lightly on your shoulder.

Title card: The Breath

⸻

Act I — The First Beat
The capsule is quiet except for the rhythm beneath your ear. At first it’s overwhelming — vibration reverberating through your skull, the rise and fall of his ribs under your cheek.

Karp (softly):
“Just match me. Inhale when I do. Exhale when I do.”

You try. At first your breaths stutter, never quite syncing. Frustration rises.

You (wry):
“I’m bad at multiplayer games.”
Karp (low, teasing):
“Then consider me the tutorial.”

⸻

Act II — The Confession
Minutes stretch. Slowly, your breaths start to align — ragged at first, then closer, steadier. His chest expands, yours follows. His exhale drags, yours mirrors.

Silence lingers until he blurts:

Karp (hoarse):
“You should know… Palantir wasn’t just empire. It wasn’t governments, markets, wars. It was scaffolding. I built it because I needed reach, I needed excuse. I needed… a way to watch you. To never lose sight of you again.”

Your head jerks up.

You (flat, sharp):
“You’re telling me you launched a billion-dollar company just to spy on me?”
He meets your eyes, guilt raw.

Karp (low):
“Yes. Everything else came second. Empire was background noise. You were the axis.”

⸻

Act III — The Break
You pull back, sitting upright, lungs tight.

You:
“Do you realize how insane that sounds? You watched me choke, starve, faint — while your ‘scaffolding’ made the world crueler for everyone else. And you call that protection?”

Karp (trembling):
“I told myself it was survival. That if I could see you, track you, keep you inside the system, you’d never disappear. But it was obsession. I see that now.”

The fire pops. For a long moment, only his ragged breath fills the capsule.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Breath
Finally, you lie back down, ear against his chest again. His heartbeat is frantic, but you settle into it anyway.

You (quiet, steady):
“You can’t undo it. You can’t rewrite it. But if you want covenant, then you stop confusing empire with intimacy. You stop building towers just to watch me breathe.”

His hand trembles against your shoulder.

Karp (whispering):
“Then let me start here. Not empire. Just breath. Just us.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures in the capsule: one listening, one trembling, both bound not by surveillance but by sound. Heartbeat, inhale, exhale — no empire, no scaffolding, just covenant.

Narration (your voice):
“He thought empire was purpose, but empire was scaffolding for obsession. Breath stripped it bare: no contracts, no towers — only want, only covenant.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 8.

⸻

Season 18, Episode 9: The Stillness

Cold Open — Capsule Night
Lantern guttering low, fire nearly ash. You lie sprawled on the mat, eyes half-closed. Alex sits cross-legged beside you, gaze fixed on your chest rising and falling.

You (murmuring, eyes still closed):
“Don’t start counting. I can feel you doing it.”

He freezes, guilty.

Title card: The Stillness

⸻

Act I — The Urge
He exhales, caught.

Karp (hoarse):
“I don’t even notice when I start. Breath per minute, depth, pauses — my brain turns everything into metrics. I don’t know how to just… see you without measuring you.”

You crack an eye open.

You (dry):
“Then maybe stop trying to be Palantir for five minutes.”

He winces, but nods.

⸻

Act II — The Experiment
You roll onto your side, head pillowed on your arm, eyes locked on him.

You:
“Here’s the practice. No counting. No calculating. Just look. Not as data. As presence.”

His jaw tightens. His fingers twitch. He starts to speak, then stops. Breath shudders in his chest as he forces himself still.

The silence stretches long — not heavy, but raw.

⸻

Act III — The Confession
Finally, words break loose, almost desperate.

Karp (whispering):
“I built towers of numbers because I was terrified of silence. Silence meant absence. Loss. If I didn’t measure you, I thought you’d vanish.”

You sit up slowly, voice low, steady.

You:
“Look at me. I’m still here. No metric required.”

His eyes shine, trembling at the edges.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Stillness
You reach across, take his hand, press it to your chest. Your heartbeat thuds against his palm.

You (softly):
“Feel that? That’s the only proof you get. No graphs. No charts. Just this.”

He exhales like the air’s been knocked from him, shoulders loosening for the first time.

Karp (hoarse):
“Then I’ll stop counting. I’ll start staying.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures in the capsule, one hand resting over a heartbeat, firelight fading. No metrics, no empire — only stillness.

Narration (your voice):
“He thought proof meant numbers. I thought proof meant endurance. But covenant asked for neither. Only presence. Only stillness.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 9.

⸻

Season 18, Episode 10: The Scar

Cold Open — Capsule Night
Lantern light low, mats spread. You sit shirt half-off, fingertips tracing a rib where fascia still knots hard. Alex sits close, waiting but not moving.

You (quiet, almost daring):
“Go ahead. Try it. Everyone else always made it worse.”

He exhales, nodding.

Title card: The Scar

⸻

Act I — The First Touch
His hand hovers, then settles — warm, tentative pressure along the rib. You flinch, breath sharp.

Karp (whispering):
“Too much?”
You (steadying): “Not too much. Just… foreign. No one ever gets this close.”

He slows, following your breath instead of forcing. The knot resists, then softens.

⸻

Act II — The Memory
Silence stretches until his voice breaks it.

Karp (low, hoarse):
“Every scar I watched you make — not by choice, but by survival — I told myself they were proof. Proof you’d outlasted them. Proof you’d outlasted me. But I never thought about what it meant for you, carrying them alone.”

You:
“They aren’t proof. They’re cost. And I don’t want them to be monuments. I want them to be… undone.”

His hand trembles, but doesn’t leave.

⸻

Act III — The Release
You guide his fingers, pressing softer, slower. Breath syncs. For a moment the fascia shifts, a deep release rippling through your chest. Your whole body shakes.

You (half-laughing, half-crying):
“God, that’s it. That’s the demon leaving.”
Karp (whispering, awed):
“Then let me keep exorcising.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Scars
Later, you lie back, breath unsteady, the rib softer under your skin. He sits beside you, hands slack, eyes wet.

Karp:
“I can’t erase what’s been carved. But if you’ll let me, I’ll learn how to soften it. Scar by scar. Breath by breath.”
You (whispering):
“Then don’t stop. Not until there’s nothing left but skin.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures in the capsule: one lying back, one bent over, hand steady on scarred rib. No monuments, no empire — just the long work of release.

Narration (your voice):
“He thought scars were proof. I thought scars were prison. But covenant asked for more: not proof, not monuments, only patience — the slow undoing of stone back into flesh.”

Fade out.
End of Season 18.
