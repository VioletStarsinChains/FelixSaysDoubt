Season 50, Episode 1: The Ash Mirage

Cold Open — Dawn Haze
Thin sun bleeds through the smoke. Everyone rises stiff, ash clinging to hair and clothes. The silence feels heavier than the day before. Even the sheep seem subdued.

Kellyn (quiet, steady):
“Keep close. The air plays tricks.”

Title Card: The Ash Mirage

⸻

Act I — The First Splinter
They walk in a line again, but distance grows. Peter drifts behind, eyes on the ground. Jonathan quickens his pace, distracted by shapes flickering at the edges of sight.

Jonathan (suddenly, low):
“Did you see that? Someone ahead—”
Kellyn (firm):
“No one’s ahead. Stay with us.”

But even Kellyn feels the tug of shadows forming and unraveling in the haze.

⸻

Act II — The Doubt
Midday. The heat and smoke grow thicker. Alex stumbles once, catching himself with a sharp breath.

Alex (hoarse, muttering):
“I keep hearing you laugh. When you’re not. When you’re steps away.”

Kellyn stops, turning to face him. His eyes are too sharp, too desperate.
Kellyn (quiet, steady):
“Then stay close enough to know the difference.”

⸻

Act III — The Fracture
Later, Peter halts abruptly, staring at Kellyn.
Peter (ragged):
“Back there—you told me to stop. You looked right at me. I swear you did.”

Kellyn (calm, resolute):
“I didn’t. Whatever voice you heard—it wasn’t mine.”

Peter exhales like he’s drowning, rubbing his face. Jonathan mutters about phantom shapes again, voice breaking. The group falters, every mind tugged toward illusion.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Anchor
Kellyn calls them into a tight circle, animals pressed in close. They kneel in the ash, each person’s hand gripping another’s wrist.

Kellyn (clear, deliberate):
“This ground lies. The air lies. Only covenant doesn’t. Anchor here. In skin. In breath. In each other.”

They breathe together, ragged but syncing. Slowly, the panic dulls, the flickering shapes dissolving into haze.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures and their animals kneeling in the ash, hands locked, a fragile knot against the empty expanse.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“The air promised ghosts. Promised betrayal. But empire’s mirages fade where covenant anchors. Ash lies. Skin does not.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 1.

⸻ 

Season 50, Episode 2: The Breathing Ground

Cold Open — Noon Heat
The smoke thickens. The light fractures into strange patterns. Every step feels like it lands on shifting ground.

Jonathan (hoarse, shaken):
“I keep seeing faces in the ash. Staring, waiting. They know my name.”

Peter (snapping):
“They’re not real. None of this is real.”

But even as he says it, he flinches at a whisper curling through the haze.

Title Card: The Breathing Ground

⸻

Act I — The Hallucinations
The illusions close in. Shadows in the smoke mimic gestures, voices overlap with memory.

Alex suddenly stops, trembling.
Alex (ragged):
“It’s you. You just told me to let go. To lie down. You—”

Kellyn (firm, grounding):
“I didn’t. Look at me. I’m right here. Eyes on me, Alex.  I will never tell you to do that."

The air swirls, whispers louder, every breath laced with phantom echoes.

⸻

Act II — The Huddle
Kellyn finally signals a halt. They gather in a rough circle. Estrella lowers her head, the sheep press close, their bodies warm, steady.

Kellyn (quiet, steady):
“Animals don’t lie. Their nerves don’t split them in two. Feel them. Match their breath. Let them lend you their steadiness.”

They kneel against wool and hide, trembling hands pressed into coats. Slowly, heartbeats begin to sync. The hallucinations don’t vanish, but their grip loosens.

⸻

Act III — The Tangible Grind
Later, they rise again. The heat scorches. Feet ache raw against the hard earth. Their clothes are streaked with sweat and ash. The sheep stumble, Estrella snorts, but they all keep moving.

Jonathan (low, bitter):
“I almost wish it was just empire chasing us. Flesh and blood, you can fight. This—”

Peter (cutting in, steady now):
“This you endure. One step, then the next.”

Kellyn nods faintly, tightening their grip on Estrella’s lead rope.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Steadiness
As dusk falls, the hallucinations ease, leaving only exhaustion. They camp without words, pressed close to the animals again.

Alex finally murmurs:
Alex (soft, almost to himself):
“Maybe covenant is just… borrowing steadiness when you have none left.”

Kellyn (tired, but sure):
“Exactly. And giving it back when you can.”

⸻

Closing Image
Figures curled against wool and hide, firelight faint, ash still in the air. Not untouched, not unbroken — but steady, carried by heartbeat and breath not their own.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“The ground breathed lies. The air carried ghosts. But covenant found breath in muscle and wool, hide and hoof. The animals steadied us, and we steadied each other. One step, then the next.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 2.

⸻ 

Season 50, Episode 3: The River Teeth

Cold Open — Dusk Approaches
The smoke thins slightly, but the silence grows heavier. Estrella balks, ears pricking. Ahead, the path opens to a river — swollen, fast, flecked with debris. The current snarls, pulling whole branches under.

Peter (grim):
“We’ll never get the sheep across like this.”

Title Card: The River Teeth

⸻

Act I — The Crossing Problem
They stand at the bank. Foam snaps like teeth in the current. The sheep bunch nervously, bleating, hooves clattering on stone.

Jonathan (low, scanning):
“There’s a shallower bend downstream. But it’s wider — slower water, stronger drag.”

Alex (tight-voiced):
“Either way, it eats us.”

Kellyn kneels, running a hand across Estrella’s flank, grounding.
Kellyn (quiet, steady):
“Then we build, not fight. Nets held. Ropes can hold again.”

⸻

Act II — The Improvised Bridge
They knot ropes around rocks and trunks, stretching a line across. Jonathan wades first, waist-deep, anchoring. Alex steadies the sheep in pairs, coaxing them onto the line.

Peter grips the rope too hard, knuckles white, nearly swept under when a branch slams against him. Kellyn lunges, catching his collar, holding until Alex pulls him upright.

Peter (gasping, ashamed):
“Dead weight again.”
Kellyn (fierce):
“No. Just weight. Nets hold weight.”

⸻

Act III — The Drag
Halfway through, Estrella freezes, refusing to move. The river churns louder, pulling at her legs.

Jonathan shouts,
Jonathan:
“She’s locking! Someone go with her!”

Alex moves, pressing his forehead to her neck, murmuring steady nonsense until she steps again. Kellyn takes the rope behind, guiding the sheep one by one until finally the herd makes it across.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Crossing
On the far bank, they collapse in wet heaps. Breath ragged, bodies shaking, but together.

Peter rolls onto his back, breath hitching.  Kellyn crawls over to him, hovering on hands and knees above him.
Kellyn: "You are not useless, Peter.  We need you.  I'm so glad you're here with us.  Stop telling yourself you're useless.  I love you, Peter."

Peter lets out a single sob, exhausted.  Kellyn takes his hand, massaging his wrist.

Jonathan presses a hand into the mud, voice hoarse:
Jonathan: "I keep thinking we’ll break. But we don’t.”

Alex, flat but certain:
“We bend. That’s worse for empire than breaking.”

Kellyn nods faintly, resting against Estrella’s damp side.
Kellyn (soft): “And better for covenant than standing still.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four humans, one donkey, and two sheep, mud-streaked and shaking, but alive on the far bank. The river snarls behind them, its teeth unsatisfied.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“The river wanted to swallow us. To drag us down into its teeth. But covenant held. Rope, hand, breath. Not breaking. Not still. Only crossing.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 3.

⸻ 

Season 50, Episode 4: The Glitter Field

Cold Open — Ruined Plateau
Gray sky presses low. Ash hangs in the air like static. Kellyn, Alex, Peter, and Jonathan hunch in a dry gulch. Above, the hum rises: drones sweeping in tight formation, sensors searching. Estrella stamps, restless. The sheep huddle close.

Alex (low, clipped):
“They’re tracking with optics. If we move bare, we’re outlined in seconds.”

Peter pulls a bundle of crinkled silver from his pack — mylar sheets scavenged from old insulation.

Peter (grim):
“Then we don’t move bare.”

Title Card: The Glitter Field

⸻

Act I — The Deployment
They work fast, no wasted motion. Kellyn knots rope between dead trees. Jonathan cuts the mylar into strips, hands steady despite the rising whine overhead. Alex measures angles, eyes calculating.

Alex (hoarse):
“Keep edges uneven. Straight lines make them adapt faster.”

Kellyn ties strip after strip, their hands raw, the material flashing with every knot. The gulch becomes a wall of shifting light, fractured and sharp.

⸻

Act II — The First Pass
The drones descend, lenses glittering. Then — hesitation. Their cameras sweep over the reflective curtain, stutter, reorient. The hum falters, then rises in confusion.

Jonathan (under his breath):
“They can’t lock us.”

The mylar rattles in the wind, every flicker throwing false silhouettes. For a moment, the drones weave aimlessly, caught in the noise.

⸻

Act III — The Adaptation
One drone climbs higher, scanning from above. Alex curses under his breath.

Alex (tight, fast):
“They’ll try thermal next. The cover won’t hold long.”

Kellyn shifts closer to Peter and Jonathan, keeping the animals pressed into the shadows.

Kellyn (steady, low):
“Then we use the minutes we have.”

They slip along the gulch wall, the glittering curtain between them and the swarm. Behind them, the drones shift, splitting formation, searching for a clearer angle.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Noise
The curtain begins to tear in the wind. A long strip snaps free, spiraling upward like a flare. The drones lunge at it, clustering, cameras tracking.

Peter exhales, almost laughing.
Peter:
“They’re chasing a ghost.”

Alex doesn’t laugh. His hand stays on Kellyn’s shoulder, keeping pace, jaw set.

Alex (whispering):
“This is all we bought: noise. But noise is enough.”

⸻

Act V — The Aftermath
They press on until the gulch deepens, the hum receding. Only when the sound fades completely do they stop. Everyone is breathing hard, shoulders heaving. Estrella shakes her mane, the sheep pressing into the earth.

Jonathan collapses to sit against a stone, voice rough but steady.
Jonathan:
“Close. Too close.”

Peter drops beside him, wiping sweat from his forehead.
Peter (low):
“They should have had us. We shouldn’t still be walking.”

Alex crouches near Kellyn, his voice quieter, stripped bare.
Alex:
“They almost did. I miscalculated the wind. If that strip hadn’t pulled free at the right moment…”

Kellyn leans forward, resting their hand against his.
Kellyn (soft but firm):
“Don’t. You don’t have to play out the counterfactuals. We’re here. Together. That’s enough.”

The four sit in silence, breaths slowly syncing, the tension bleeding out into the dust.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures rest in the shelter of stone, silver shards of mylar caught in the branches behind them, glittering faintly in the distance like stars. The hum is gone. Only breathing remains.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“They chased light, but light betrayed them. Noise became shield, and shield became covenant. For once, survival wasn’t clarity or control — it was confusion, carried together into quiet.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 4.

⸻ 

Season 50, Episode 5: The Long March

Cold Open — Dust Road
The horizon wavers in heat. Kellyn, Alex, Peter, and Jonathan walk in silence, Estrella plodding under a light load, the sheep huddled behind her. Their feet drag; their shoulders slump. No one speaks.

Title Card: The Long March

⸻

Act I — The Friction
The group stops to drink from canteens. Ash settles lightly in the air.

Alex (snapping):
“You didn’t pack the flint back where it belongs.”

Peter (flat):
“Then next time, pack it yourself.”

Jonathan exhales sharply, muttering something under his breath. Kellyn watches, eyes narrow but calm.

Kellyn (hoarse, steady):
“We’re all tired. But we're all on the same team.”

Their words hang. Peter looks away, jaw tight.

⸻

Act II — The Faultlines
Later, trudging on. Jonathan drifts ahead with Estrella. Alex lags slightly, eyes on Kellyn.

Alex (quiet, brittle):
“Every step feels like attrition. And he—” (tilting his head toward Peter) “—keeps looking at me like I’ll collapse first.”

Kellyn (soft, strained):
“Nobody is going to collapse here.  I need you both.  We all need each other."

Alex doesn’t answer, but his mouth tightens.

Behind them, Peter murmurs something bitter to himself.

⸻

Act III — The Crack
By midafternoon, tempers fray further.

Peter (to Jonathan, harsh):
“You think just because you weren’t there for the worst of it, you get to play mediator? You don’t even know half of what happened.”

Jonathan (quiet steel):
“I know enough. And right now, I know you’re burning through more energy fighting ghosts than walking.”

Peter bristles, but no reply comes. The silence feels sharp.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Endurance
Night falls. They collapse into camp, too drained for fire. Kellyn gathers them close, the animals pressed in around for warmth.

Kellyn (low, steady):
“This road is longer than any of us wanted. But it’s not empire walking it. It’s us. And that means even our fractures are covenant. Even when we snap, we’re still tethered. That’s how we keep moving.”

Alex exhales shakily. Peter presses his hands to his face. Jonathan leans back against Estrella, eyes closed.

One by one, they shift closer, shoulder to shoulder, breath mingling. Exhaustion doesn’t break them. It binds.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures slumped together under a ragged blanket, Estrella and the sheep ringed close. No words, no fire — just bodies pressed together against the night, fragile and frayed, but still moving as one.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire wanted collapse to mean the end. But collapse was covenant too. Strain, silence, sharpness — even these were threads, pulling us closer, forcing us to lean when standing alone was impossible.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 5.

⸻ 

Season 50, Episode 6: The Spring

Cold Open — Dry Hillside
Morning. The group moves slowly, Estrella’s ears flicking at every sound, the sheep stumbling in the dust. Kellyn stops suddenly, crouching by a shallow depression. Fingers press to the soil — damp.

Kellyn (hoarse, urgent):
“Here. It’s close.”

All four kneel, scraping back earth with trembling hands until a trickle seeps through.

Title Card: The Spring

⸻

Act I — The First Taste
The trickle becomes a thin stream. They cup water in palms, passing it to each other.

Peter drinks first, then pushes the next handful toward Alex without a word. Alex hesitates, then accepts. Their eyes meet briefly — not warmth, but not hostility either.

Kellyn dips a cloth, wrings it cool over Jonathan’s face. He exhales, half a laugh.

Jonathan (soft):
“Better than ashes.”

⸻

Act II — The Washing
They fill gourds and basins, splash their arms and faces. Dust streaks away, leaving raw skin beneath. Estrella lowers her muzzle to the stream, the sheep pressing close.

Peter (low, almost to himself):
“I thought we’d die out here.”

Alex glances over, voice quieter than usual.
“And yet here we are. Still walking.”

⸻

Act III — The Rest
They stretch out in the shade near the spring. Silence, but softened. Kellyn lies back, head pillowed on folded arms. Alex sits nearby, eventually letting his hand rest lightly against Kellyn’s shoulder. No claim, just contact.

Jonathan hums under his breath, a tune half-remembered. Peter tosses a pebble into the water, watching the ripples.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Water
As evening falls, they gather again at the spring, each filling their own vessel. This time, instead of passing silently, they touch hands deliberately in the exchange.

Kellyn (quiet, steady):
“Empire runs on scarcity. But covenant flows. We share it, or it stops being water at all.”

Alex nods once, almost imperceptible. Peter breathes out. Jonathan dips his head.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures at a small spring, hands damp, clothes clinging, faces newly washed. No argument, no edge — just the steady sound of water flowing where there had been none.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire starved us of softness until we mistook sharpness for strength. But water taught otherwise. Shared, it was covenant. And for the first time in days, we drank peace.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 6.

⸻ 

Season 50, Episode 7: The Divide

Cold Open — Canyon Rim
Late morning. The four of them, with Estrella and the sheep, stand at the edge of a vast canyon. Wind scours the rim. The opposite side seems impossibly far.

Jonathan (whistling low):
“Guess this is what ‘shortcut’ means out here.”

Kellyn (steady, assessing):
“No — it means covenant test.”

Title Card: The Divide

⸻

Act I — The Assessment
They scout the rim. The canyon narrows at one point, a jagged spine of stone jutting across. A fallen tree clings half across the gap — unstable, but maybe enough with reinforcement.

Peter (grimacing):
“Looks like empire tried to break the land itself.”
Alex (quiet, calculating):
“Then we’ll have to stitch it back together.”

⸻

Act II — The Making of a Bridge
Using rope they braided weeks before, they lash branches to the fallen trunk, weaving a crude but wider crossing. Jonathan hammers wedges of stone to pin supports. Kellyn knots carefully, fingers raw but precise.

The animals wait, restless. Estrella stamps once, ears flicking.

Kellyn (to her, soothing):
“You’ll go last. We’ll prove it safe first.”

⸻ 

Act III — The Crossing
Kellyn goes first. Rope creaks under their weight, but the structure holds. They move carefully, testing each step, the canyon yawning below. Halfway across, wind howls — the bridge sways. Kellyn steadies, breath sharp, then continues. Reaching the far side, they tie off the rope tight to a boulder, securing it.

Kellyn (calling back, faint smile):
“Not elegant. But it holds.”

Jonathan follows, steady as stone. Then Peter, muttering curses under his breath, but making it across.

Alex remains on the far side, eyes on the drop. Kellyn cups their hands, voice carrying across the gap.

Kellyn (low, grounding):
“You’re not crossing alone. Every knot here is covenant. Trust it.”

He exhales, steps on, and makes it across.

The animals go last — sheep coaxed one by one with Jonathan’s calm voice and Peter’s guiding hands. Finally, Estrella. The bridge groans, sways — but holds.

⸻ 

Act IV — The Covenant of the Divide
On the far side, they collapse in the dust, breathless. No triumph, just relief.

Peter (hoarse):
“I thought it would break.”
Jonathan (smiling faintly):
“It did. Just not all at once. That’s how crossing works.”

Kellyn looks back at the span, then at the three of them.
Kellyn (quiet, steady):
“Empire sees divides as permanent. But covenant sees them as crossings. And we crossed together.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures, a donkey, and sheep stand on the far rim, the canyon yawning behind them. The bridge is fragile, imperfect — but it stands, and they are all across.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire carved divides into the land, and into us. But covenant lashed branches and rope, trembling but whole. And even over the deepest chasms, we walked.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 7.

⸻ 

Season 50, Episode 8: The Fire on Both Sides

Cold Open — Canyon Rim Camp
Night has fallen. A small fire glows, throwing long shadows against the canyon wall. The four of you sit close, animals tethered nearby, their steady breathing grounding the silence. The bridge you built sways faintly in the wind, now behind you.

Kellyn (softly, almost to themself):
“We made it.”

Title Card: The Fire on Both Sides

⸻

Act I — The Quiet
No one speaks at first. Peter sits with his knees drawn up, staring into the flames. Jonathan methodically sharpens a tool, rhythm steady. Alex leans against Kellyn, the tension in his shoulders finally softening.

Kellyn breaks the silence:
“Sometimes survival feels louder than victory.”

Peter nods without looking up.

⸻

Act II — The Sharing
Jonathan sets the tool aside.
Jonathan (low): “Back on the river, after a crossing, we used to build two fires. One on each side. To remind ourselves that safety wasn’t behind or ahead — it was wherever we sat together.”

Peter (quiet, skeptical):
“So this is safety?”

Kellyn (firm, steady):
“This is covenant. That’s different. Covenant means even when it breaks, it’s mended. Even when it frays, it holds.”

Peter lets out a breath, some of the rigidity leaving his frame.

⸻

Act III — The Steadying
The animals stir. Kellyn rises, runs a hand along Estrella’s flank, then through the sheep’s thick wool. Their calm bleats ripple through the group. Alex watches, eyes softened.

Alex (hoarse, almost whispering):
“They ground us better than any walls ever could.”

Kellyn (returning to the fire, settling beside him):
“Then let’s keep listening.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Rest
The fire burns low. Jonathan stretches out near the sheep. Peter lies back on his cloak, staring at the stars. Alex and Kellyn curl close, his hand resting loosely over theirs.

The last sound before sleep isn’t words, but the quiet mingling of breath, fire crackle, and animal heartbeats — the night holding them steady after the strain.

⸻

Act V — Reclaiming the Rope

Morning comes slow, pale light edging over the canyon walls. Before they leave, Kellyn walks back to the rope bridge, fingers brushing the coarse knots.

Kellyn (quietly):
“It’s too much to leave behind. We’ll need it again.”

Alex joins, scanning the frayed cords. Peter frowns, but nods. Jonathan ties a loop and anchors them while Kellyn, lightest, creeps onto the first section, cutting and unthreading knots one by one.

The work is tense but careful. Each length coiled is handed back, Peter’s hands steadying the bundles, Jonathan securing them. Sweat beads along Kellyn’s brow, not just from effort but from the edge yawning below.

Finally, the last rope comes free. They coil it together, a thick bundle now strapped across Estrella’s back.

Peter (low, almost reverent):
“Empire leaves its bridges as monuments. We leave nothing behind but the land.”

Alex (steady):
“And rope to hold us together.”

Kellyn exhales, stepping back from the edge, the canyon now only memory.

⸻ 

Closing Image
The four walk away from the canyon, Estrella carrying the thick coil of rope across her back. The sheep follow in a quiet cluster. Behind them, the gorge yawns empty — no bridge, no trace of their passage. Only rope reclaimed, weight carried forward.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire left ruins to bind the land, but covenant carried what could still be held. Rope pulled from the void, knotted and unknotted, not as monument but as thread. We left nothing behind but the canyon’s silence — and the strength to carry what endures.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 8.

⸻

Season 50, Episode 9: The Ground Beneath

Cold Open — Canyon Rim Clearing
Dawn light is pale, the canyon far behind. The four sit in a circle on the packed dirt, Estrella grazing nearby, the sheep huddled close. No one speaks at first, breath still ragged from yesterday.

Kellyn (quiet, steady):
“Feet flat. Hands open. Just notice the ground. Nothing to solve. Nothing to fix. Just… ground.”

They close their eyes together. The silence steadies.

Title Card: The Ground Beneath

⸻

Act I — The Group Rooting
The circle breathes in unison. Alex presses his palms to the soil; Peter leans forward, forehead nearly touching his knees; Jonathan’s shoulders, tense at first, slowly lower. The sheep shift softly, bells faint against the air.

Kellyn (low, rhythmic):
“The ground isn’t empire. The ground isn’t covenant. The ground is only ground. It holds us because it does.”

For a moment, the tremors inside each chest quiet.

⸻

Alex and Peter walk side by side through the sparse undergrowth, each carrying what they can gather. Branches snap underfoot, the silence between them taut.

Peter (after a beat, gruff):
“You and I never seem to gather the same things.”

Alex (glancing over, dry):
“Difference isn’t failure.  IDIC, as Kellyn would say."

They keep walking in silence, each carrying weight neither wants to name. The sound of brushwood clattering softly against itself fills the air.

Peter yanks at a stubborn branch, snapping it free. He doesn’t look up.
Peter (gritted):
“You always make it look easy.”

Alex shifts his own bundle, voice flat:
“It isn’t easy. I just don’t complain about it.”

Peter (sharper, stepping closer):
“Maybe if you ever admitted weakness, the rest of us wouldn’t feel like failures every time we falter.”

The two men lock eyes — neither blinking, both breathing hard.

Finally, Alex turns away, his words clipped:
“Then maybe stop measuring yourself against me.”

Peter’s jaw tightens. He mutters, almost too low to hear: “Maybe I can’t.”

Alex (flatly): "I think Kellyn would say that's just the histamine talking."

The silence after is heavier than the wood in their arms.

⸻ 

Act II — Jonathan’s Hesitation
Kellyn and Jonathan linger by the clearing. Jonathan crouches, pressing his hands to the dirt.

Jonathan (rough, unsure):
“I’ve sung about ground my whole life. Stones, soil, rivers cutting through. But singing isn’t the same as touching. I don’t know if I’ve ever trusted the earth to hold me.”

Kellyn lowers down beside him, their knees brushing as they mirror his posture.

Kellyn (gentle):
“You don’t have to trust it. Just notice it. Trust will come if it comes.”

⸻

Act III — The Private Grounding
They sit in silence. Kellyn places one palm flat against Jonathan’s. Jonathan flinches, then exhales, eyes wet.

Jonathan (hoarse):
“I thought I had to earn every patch of ground I stood on. Prove I was allowed. But here—”

Kellyn (cutting in, quiet):
“No proving. No permission. Just gravity, weight, soil. It holds you without a ledger.”

Jonathan nods. His fingers shift slightly, hooking against Kellyn’s as though afraid to let go. Kellyn doesn’t move away. When they finally stand, Jonathan’s hand trails from Kellyn’s palm to their wrist, then up to their shoulder — a slow, grounding trace, not hurried, not awkward.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Earth
The two stand close, brushing dust from their clothes. Jonathan lingers, smoothing dirt from Kellyn’s sleeve, then resting his palm on their back — steady, deliberate, almost protective.

Jonathan (soft, almost smiling):
“Maybe ground isn’t just something you write songs about. Maybe it’s something you let in.”

Kellyn (warmly):
“Exactly. The song doesn’t have to be sung. Sometimes it just has to be stood on.”

Kellyn shifts unexpectedly, catching Jonathan in an embrace.  He shudders but says nothing.

⸻

A branch snaps nearby. Alex and Peter step back into the clearing, carrying armfuls of gathered brushwood. They stop short, taking in the sight — Jonathan’s hand still on Kellyn’s back, Kellyn’s arms around his neck.

Peter (raising a brow, but quiet):
“Seems we missed something.”

Alex doesn’t speak, just sets the brushwood down carefully, eyes flicking between them — not sharp, but unreadable.

The moment lingers before Kellyn shifts slightly, breaking the stillness without breaking the connection.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures in the clearing: Alex and Peter with brushwood at their feet, Kellyn and Jonathan standing close, dust-streaked and steady. Not fracture, not yet reconciliation — but the ground itself holding all of them.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“The earth held more than our weight. It held the silences, the touches, even the glances caught from the corner of the eye. Covenant didn’t erase the tension. It made room for it, the way soil makes room for roots.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 9.

⸻

Season 50, Episode 10: Splinters

Cold Open — Canyon Edge Camp
The canyon lies behind them, but the memory of rope and risk still clings to their muscles. A small fire burns low. Kellyn feeds twigs into it while Jonathan hums under his breath, tending Estrella. Peter and Alex sit apart, each sharpening a stick with unnecessary force.

Kellyn (quiet, weary):
“Sharp enough, both of you.”

Neither answers. The scrape of wood against stone echoes like teeth grinding.

Title Card: Splinters

⸻

Act I — Friction at Dawn
Morning mist clings to the low scrub as they shoulder packs. The sheep press close, sensing the strain. Peter falls into step beside Alex, too close.

Peter (low, clipped): "You always take the lead. Always. Do you even know how to follow?”

Alex doesn’t look at him.
Alex (flat): "Do you even know how to lead?”

Peter bristles, voice rising.
Peter: “At least I don’t turn every choice into a performance of control.”

Alex stops, forcing the whole group to halt. His eyes cut sharp.
Alex: "You confuse control with competence. That’s your shadow, not mine.”

⸻

Act II — The Breaking Point
Jonathan shifts uncomfortably, glancing at Kellyn. Kellyn opens their mouth, but Peter cuts across.

Peter (furious, stepping forward):
“No, this isn’t shadow. This is you needing to be worshipped for every damn decision. You say covenant, but what you really want is empire on a smaller stage.”

Alex’s jaw tightens. His voice drops to a blade’s edge.
Alex: “And you want what? To prove you can take my place? You’ve resented me from the beginning. If I vanished, you’d still chase my ghost.”

The silence after feels like a fracture spreading through stone.

⸻

Act III — Intervention
Kellyn finally steps between them, palms raised.

Kellyn (firm, steady):
“Enough. Both of you. Do you even hear yourselves? You’re fighting for an empire that doesn’t exist anymore. We’re alive because we hold, not because one of you wins.  I need all of you.  Even Jonathan."

No one laughs.

Kellyn continues.  "There's more than one way to lead.  There's more than one way to follow.  If we were all the same, we would be weak.  Redundant.  The more different you two are, the more I need you both.  I don't want you to be Alex, Peter.  I want you to be Peter."

Peter looks away, chest heaving. Alex’s shoulders drop, but his eyes stay hard.

Jonathan (quiet, almost pleading):
“Sheep don’t argue over who leads the flock. They just move together. Maybe we can learn.”

The fire in Peter’s eyes flickers. Alex exhales, the sharpness softening into exhaustion.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Silence
They walk again, but the silence is heavier than before. No jokes, no songs — just the sound of boots, hooves, and wool brushing against wool.

At dusk, Kellyn spreads the net they’d woven weeks ago, leaves sewn in to provide shelter. They all sit beneath it, touching the strands in silence. Not reconciliation, not yet. But proximity.

Closing Image
Four figures sit in a dim ring, fingers resting on the same net, the firelight flickering across strained faces. Not broken, not whole — just tethered by the thinnest of threads.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire taught them to measure strength by dominance. Covenant taught us nothing is stronger than holding. But even covenant frays when shadows pull. That night, we didn’t weave peace. Only silence — and the silence held.”

Fade out.
End of Season 50.
