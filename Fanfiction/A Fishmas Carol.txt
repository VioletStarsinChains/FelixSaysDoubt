(outline—WIP)

Prologue:
Alex Karp, CEO of Palantir, sits alone in his cabin in New Hampshire, poring over predictive models that forecast not only stock prices but human heartbreak. He insists he is the lone anomaly who cannot be modeled—until Christmas Eve, when a strange signal interrupts his models.

Act I — The Ghost of Christmas Past
	•	Appears as Peter Thiel in spectral form, holding an AmEx Centurion card instead of chains.
	•	Shows Karp the early days of Palantir: idealistic engineers promising to fight terrorism, while Karp practices tai chi in parking lots.
	•	Past also shows missed moments of human connection, replaced by neural net tuning.
	•	Quote: “You were building software to know the world—but not to know yourself.”

⸻

Act II — The Ghost of Christmas Present
	•	Appears as a massive dashboard visualization come alive, shimmering with heatmaps.
	•	The ghost reveals the surveillance analysts working endless shifts, their lives quietly traded in behavioral futures markets while Karp enjoys mountain solitude.
	•	Shows a family in crisis—unable to afford housing, but their metadata is worth billions.
	•	Quote: “See how they live, Alex. Their suffering is your quarterly earnings.”

⸻

Act III — The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come
	•	Appears as a synthetic anomaly model in a hooded robe, faceless, its form flickering like corrupted data.
	•	Shows a future where Karp himself has been fully simulated and forgotten; a digital doppelgänger signs contracts while no one remembers the real man.
	•	The grave reads not his name, but simply “Non-Person Entity (NPE)”.
	•	Quote: “In the end, your models consumed you too.”

Epilogue

Karp wakes up on Christmas morning. Instead of rushing to CNBC, he goes barefoot through the snow to the nearest town, shouting “I am still real!” He hands out free Palantir licenses as gifts—but the villagers politely decline, asking instead for housing, food, and privacy.
