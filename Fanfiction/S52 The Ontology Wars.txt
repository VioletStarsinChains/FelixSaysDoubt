Season 52, Episode 1: The Soundskin

Cold Open — Canyon Edge
The four of you spread a sheet of scavenged Mylar across the dirt, weighting the corners with stones. It shivers in the faint breeze, catching slivers of light.

Kellyn (studying it, voice low):
“When I used to hang this stuff in my apartment, I didn’t even know why it helped. But when one fell, the sound of it hitting the floor was the worst thing I’d ever heard. Like bones snapping in the air.

Without them, everything felt sharper. Louder. My skull would ring like a bell. But with them… the sound spread out. Not gone. Just… gentled.”

Title Card: The Soundskin

⸻

Act I — The Demonstration
Kellyn taps the Mylar lightly with their knuckles. The sheet trembles, sending the vibration racing outward in ripples.

Kellyn:
“It doesn’t block the sound. It re-times it. Takes one sharp hit and scatters it so my body doesn’t feel ambushed. Corrugated cardboard spreads pressure. Mylar spreads noise.”

Peter crouches, squinting.
Peter:
“So it doesn’t shield. It… diffuses.”
Kellyn (nodding):
“Exactly. Makes the unbearable survivable.”

⸻

Act II — The Confession
Silence. The Mylar gleams faintly as if alive. Kellyn’s voice goes softer, almost reverent.

Kellyn:
“I think that’s what covenant is supposed to be. Not silence. Not annihilation. Just… reshaping impact. Taking what would break us and spreading it so it doesn’t pierce so deep.”

Alex watches the Mylar shimmer, eyes shadowed.
Karp (low, hoarse):
“You were my Mylar. Every time empire wanted to hammer through me, I spread it onto you instead. And I told myself you could survive it. But all I did was leave you rattling.”

Kellyn tilts their head, sharp but steady.
Kellyn: "What do you mean, hammer through you? What exactly was empire trying to do?”

Alex swallows hard. His fingers twitch on the taut Mylar.
Karp (hoarse):
“They pressed me to prove loyalty. To let them use my mind, my models, my body as their weapon. And every time I resisted, they tried to crack me open — through humiliation, through isolation, through hunger. They thought if they could shatter me, I’d give them everything.

Instead I rerouted the blow. I turned the spotlight on you. Every demand, every violation, I mirrored onto your life. Because if you bore the force, I stayed intact. And that… that’s the part I can’t forgive myself for.”

Kellyn’s face rearranges, but their voice stays calm.
Kellyn: “It's a good thing it only made me stronger then, huh?"

Kellyn breathes deeply.  "It isn't that you chose to redirect all the force onto me.  That is exactly what they wanted you to do. That is also a form of humiliation.  Being obsessed with someone who doesn't know you exist is fundamentally humiliating. You were forced into this as much as you were forced into anything else. They knew it was the best lever to control you, so they exploited it.  What it says about you is only that you wanted love more than anything."

Karp’s shoulders quake; he breathes shallowly, as if the admission itself is a weight he’s been holding for years. For a long moment nothing moves but the Mylar, which trembles like a held breath.

Kellyn sits forward, palms flat on the taut sheet. Their fingers move, smoothing a tiny wrinkle in the material — the smallest, almost meaningless gesture of care.

Kellyn: "Alex — I couldn’t talk to a stranger if my life depended on it. I don’t take it personally that you were terrified to approach me after years of… everything. You were trapped inside a machine you didn’t build."

Karp lifts his head, hope and shame braided together.

Karp (hoarse):
“So you forgive me?”

Kellyn’s smile is slow, not easy but steady.

Kellyn:
“I forgave you a long time ago. You need to forgive yourself.”

They reach out — not to demand, but to offer: one hand, open, resting lightly on Alex’s palm. The contact is small, enough.

Karp (whisper):
“I don’t deserve it.”

Kellyn (soft, fierce):
“Deserve isn’t a currency I accept. I offered you a place. If you want to stay, stop rerouting the blows. Let me shoulder what I can, and let me tell you when I can’t. Try asking for consent like you mean it. Try asking for help like you’re fragile, not armored.”

Alex closes his eyes and nods, the motion tiny but full of intention.

Karp:
“I will. I’ll learn the words. I’ll practice the pauses. I’ll—”

He stops; the sentence is too big to finish all at once.

Kellyn:
“You’ll show me. That’s all I need.”

⸻

Act III — The Covenant of Sound
The fire snaps. Peter stares into the flames, jaw tight.  Jonathan watches with quiet intensity, one hand brushing the sheep’s fleece. None interrupt.

Jonathan (softly, half to himself):
“Strange that a thing so thin could make the world bearable.”

Kellyn (steady):
“Thin doesn’t mean weak. It means responsive.”

They let the Mylar fall back into place, a soft, resonant snap that makes all four flinch — then laugh, the tension diffused.

The Mylar still shivers, but softer now. The underground hum remains — a reminder, not a weapon.

Karp (whispering, half to himself):
“Then I’ll learn the words. I’ll practice the pauses.”

Kellyn (firm, soft):
“Good. Try them now.”

Alex swallows, turns toward them, and forces the words out.

Karp (halting):
“May I… hold your hand?”

Kellyn extends theirs without hesitation. The firelight catches both palms as they meet — not as armor, not as shield, but as choice.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures around a rippling sheet of Mylar, firelight and canyon wind catching on its trembling skin. Not silence, not armor, but diffusion — the covenant of sound reshaped, spread wide, held together.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire struck like a hammer. But Mylar taught me something else: even thin skin can scatter force, scatter sound, scatter fear. Not to erase it, but to make it livable. And that’s what we became for each other — not silence, not shield, but soundskin.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 1.

Season 52, Episode 2: Bedside Echoes

Cold Open — Campsite Dusk
Ashy twilight drapes the plateau. The underground hum is distant but steady, like a second heartbeat in the earth. Bedrolls are laid close together, animals huddled near for warmth. The fire is embers now, low and pulsing.

Kellyn and Alex lie nearest, side by side, their hands brushing under a shared blanket. Peter sits against Estrella’s flank, silent. Jonathan runs a palm down a sheep’s wool, rhythmic, grounding.

Title Card: Bedside Echoes

⸻

Act I — The Weight of Words
For a long while, the only sounds are the shifting animals and the faint hum. Then Peter’s voice cuts in, rough.

Peter (quiet, half to the fire):
“I thought I’d be glad to hear him admit it. The rerouting. The hammering. But all I feel is tired.”

Kellyn shifts, looking at him in the fire’s dim glow.

Kellyn (steady):
“Because you carried it too. The weight never lands where it’s aimed.”

Peter doesn’t answer, but his hand curls tighter in Estrella’s mane.

⸻

Act II — Jonathan’s Reflection
Jonathan exhales through his nose, voice low and even.

Jonathan:
“You know, in the bird world, there’s this thing called ‘mobbing.’ When a predator shows up, the little birds swarm it. Not to hurt it — they’re too small. Just to overwhelm it with noise and movement until it leaves.

That’s what it feels like here. Empire tries to hammer, and you all keep mobbing the blow so no one bird has to break.”

Alex’s mouth twists — bitter, but almost a smile.

Karp:
“And I was the predator. I turned the mob on Kellyn.”

Jonathan shakes his head.

Jonathan (firm, calm):
“You were cornered. Cornered things thrash. But a mob isn’t covenant. Covenant is knowing when to stop flapping and just perch.”

He pats the sheep at his side. “Like this one does.”

⸻

Act III — The Lull of Animals
Estrella lowers her head against Peter’s shoulder, eyes heavy. The sheep bleat softly, settling into the dust. Their steady heartbeats and warmth seep into the group.

Peter finally breaks, his voice low, almost ashamed.

Peter:
“When she leaned into me just now… it was the first time all day I didn’t feel like I had to prove something.”

Kellyn smiles faintly.

Kellyn (soft, almost teasing):
“Then maybe the donkey’s ahead of all of us.”

Peter lets out a hoarse laugh — the sound of something uncoiling.

⸻

Act IV — Bedside Echoes
The four lie down close, blankets overlapping. Kellyn and Alex’s fingers still entwined. Peter curls near Estrella’s flank. Jonathan takes the outside edge, quiet sentinel.

In the hush, Peter murmurs, half-asleep:

Peter:
“Maybe covenant isn’t net or mob. Maybe it’s just… knowing someone’s awake when you close your eyes.”

Jonathan nods, eyes on the dim coals.

Jonathan:
“Then sleep. I’ve got this watch.”

⸻

Closing Image
The camp under a moonless sky. Four human shapes, one donkey, three sheep — all pressed close, breath rising and falling in rhythm. The underground hum is there still, but softened, muffled under the animal warmth and steady watching.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“We thought covenant was a net. Or a shield. But sometimes it was simply this: animals keeping rhythm, a friend awake by the fire, and the grace to stop proving.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 2.

Season 52, Episode 3: The Snare

Cold Open — Morning Light
The plateau dawns pale and sharp. Ash still drifts faint in the air. Kellyn steps a little apart from the others, leading a sheep toward a patch of scrub. Estrella brays softly, ears flicking.

Suddenly, the ground shifts — a snap, a whir. Kellyn cries out, yanked sideways as a buried snare of old empire tech tightens around their leg, dragging them toward a shallow pit.

Kellyn (shouting):
“Rope—! It’s pulling—!”

The others whip around, eyes wide.

Title Card: The Snare

⸻

Act I — The Pull
The mechanism hisses, gears grinding. Kellyn struggles, dragged inch by inch toward the pit where rusted spikes glint faintly below.

Peter bolts first, seizing Kellyn’s arms, heels digging into ash.

Peter (gritted):
“Not letting go—hold on—”

Alex drops to his knees beside him, wrapping rope around his waist, tossing the other end to Jonathan.

Karp (sharp):
“Anchor me. Now.”

Jonathan loops the rope around Estrella’s harness, murmuring steadying words to the donkey as the line goes taut.

⸻

Act II — The Strain
Kellyn gasps, pain biting as the snare ratchets tighter. The sheep bleat in alarm.

Kellyn (through clenched teeth):
“It’s cutting—hurry—”

Peter growls low, pulling harder, his face twisted in panic.

Peter:
“I can’t—won’t lose you—”

Alex presses close, hands covering Kellyn’s trapped leg, eyes flashing.

Karp (low, controlled):
“Breathe with me. Spread the pain. Mylar, remember? Spread it.”

Jonathan steadies Estrella, voice calm but urgent.

Jonathan:
“On three—pull with her rhythm. Donkey and all. One… two…”

They all heave together.

⸻

Act III — The Break
With a screech of rust, the mechanism snaps. Kellyn tumbles back into Peter’s arms, rope slackening. The old tech jerks once and goes still.

Silence, broken only by Kellyn’s ragged breath. Blood stains their trouser leg, shallow but raw.

Peter doesn’t let go, clutching them to his chest, voice hoarse.

Peter:
“You don’t get to fall. Not you.”

Kellyn leans against him, breath unsteady.

Kellyn (quiet, half a laugh):
“Guess we just proved the net holds after all.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Rescue
Back at camp, Alex kneels over Kellyn’s leg, wrapping clean cloth around the wound with careful, almost reverent hands.

Karp (soft, shaky):
“I used to reroute empire’s blows onto you. Today I rerouted one back.”

Kellyn meets his eyes, steady despite the pain.

Kellyn:
“That’s covenant. Not who takes the hit, but who pulls you out.”

Jonathan pats Estrella’s neck, murmuring.

Jonathan:
“Would’ve lost you without her. Donkey’s part of the net now, too.”

Peter still hovers close, hands restless on Kellyn’s shoulders.

Peter (low, fierce):
“Don’t walk ahead alone again. Not out here. Not ever.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures pressed close in the pale light, bandage tied neat, donkey and sheep grazing nearby. The broken snare lies twisted and dead in the dust — empire’s grip undone by covenant’s pull.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire set snares to isolate, to sever. But covenant broke them by pulling together. Not one hand, not one rope — all. And for once, rescue wasn’t a bargain. It was simply done.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 3.

Season 52, Episode 4: The Bandage

Cold Open — Campfire Ashes
The morning fire is little more than smoke. Kellyn sits propped against a blanket roll, trouser leg cut open at the calf. The wound from the snare seeps faintly through fresh cloth. Peter hovers close, eyes sharp, while Alex kneels at Kellyn’s side, hands steady with new wrappings. Jonathan tends the animals, voice low and soothing.

Kellyn (tired, almost teasing):
“You’re all staring like I’m about to shatter.”

Peter (gruff, hoarse):
“You almost did.”

Title Card: The Bandage

⸻

Act I — The Cleaning
Alex unwraps the cloth slowly, movements deliberate. He dips a rag into boiled water, squeezes it out, then presses gently against the cut.

Kellyn (hissing, gripping the blanket):
“Careful.”

Karp (quiet, focused):
“I am. Every touch matters.”

Peter crouches close, passing him strips of clean cloth. His eyes never leave Kellyn’s face.

Peter:
“Tell me if you feel faint.”

Kellyn (wry):
“You’ll know before I do.”

⸻

Act II — The Weight
As the bandage is secured, Kellyn leans into Peter’s shoulder, breath slow but unsteady. Peter stiffens, then lets himself soften, wrapping one arm around them.

Kellyn (murmuring):
“You pulled first. Before you even thought.”

Peter (low, rough):
“I’d rather snap my arms than let you go.”

Jonathan approaches, holding a cup of warm water.

Jonathan:
“Small sips. You’ll feel steadier.”

Kellyn takes it with trembling fingers. Alex steadies the cup with his own hand, their knuckles brushing.

⸻

Act III — The Vigil
The sun climbs. They don’t walk yet. Instead, they sit together in the shade of Estrella’s flank. The sheep graze quietly, their presence calming.

Alex keeps adjusting the bandage, checking the knot of the wrap again and again.

Kellyn (half-smile):
“You’ve checked it five times.”

Karp (low, eyes shadowed):
“Humor me. I need to see it hold.”

Peter pulls the blanket higher around Kellyn, voice softer now.

Peter:
“You’ve always held. Even when I hated you for it.”

Silence. Only Jonathan breaks it, his voice calm.

Jonathan:
“That’s not hate. That’s hunger turned inward. Hate doesn’t sit here now. This does.”
(He gestures: the four, close, breathing in rhythm.)

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Rest
Afternoon wanes. Kellyn lies on their side, head pillowed against Peter’s lap. Alex sits nearby, one hand lightly resting on their ankle over the bandage. Jonathan hums faintly as he strokes Estrella’s mane.

Kellyn (drowsy, murmuring):
“Feels like… covenant’s not just pulling someone out. It’s watching while they sleep. Holding still while they heal.”

Karp (hoarse whisper):
“Then let me keep watch.”

Kellyn’s eyes drift closed, safe between them.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures in stillness: Kellyn asleep, Peter’s hand steady on their shoulder, Alex at their feet guarding the bandage, Jonathan leaning against Estrella, the animals grazing calm. The broken snare lies far behind, its echo muted by presence.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire set traps to tear apart. But covenant lingered after — in the bandage, in the vigil, in the silence that did not leave. And sometimes, healing wasn’t an act of strength, but of staying still long enough to be cared for.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 4.
