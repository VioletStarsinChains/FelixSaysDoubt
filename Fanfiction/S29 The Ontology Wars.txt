Season 29, Episode 1: The Breath

Cold Open — Sanctuary Field
Morning sunlight cuts through mist. The tables and jars are gone; the square is open now. Children run barefoot, their hands still faintly gold from last night. A circle is marked out in chalk and petals. Drums thrum faintly in the distance, steady as heartbeat.

You (smiling):
“Day three isn’t about food. Or balm. It’s about breath.”

Peter tilts his head, cautious. Alex stands tall, watching the circle with a strategist’s intensity and a child's curiosity tugging at his sleeve.

Title Card: The Breath

⸻

Act I — The Games
Neighbors gather, laughter spilling as simple games begin: tug-of-war with woven ropes, hoop-rolling, blindfold tag. Children weave between adults, shrieking with delight. Peter is coaxed into joining a relay, running awkward but smiling for the first time.

Alex resists at first — then you shove him into the circle, grinning. He grumbles but plays, his stiff movements loosening with each round.

You (teasing):
“Empire loses to playground every time.”

⸻

Act II — The Ritual of Movement
As the sun climbs, the games slow. The circle reforms. Drums pulse steady, deep. You lead with breath: in, out, arms rising and falling with each wave. Soon dozens of bodies move together — swaying, kneeling, spiraling — no choreography but rhythm shared.

Karp (low, almost reverent):
“In empire, rhythm was calculation. Here… it feels like ease."

You glance at him, nodding, sweat on your brow.

⸻

Act III — The Art
After movement, the circle scatters. Clay, sticks, and fibers are passed around. Families build small sculptures, weaving twine, pressing handprints into wet clay. A child brings you a spiral of sticks tied with grass. Peter sketches lines in dirt, tentative, then lets children build on them.

Alex, almost shy, lays out geometric patterns with stones, then lets neighbors rearrange them, laughing when his precision dissolves into chaos.

You (smiling):
“Not empire. Not mask. Just play.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Breath
As dusk falls, all the pieces — clay, sticks, ropes, spirals — are brought into the circle. Lanterns glow. Drums fade into silence. For a moment, everyone simply breathes together, one body of many lungs.

You whisper to Alex and Peter:
“Day one fed us. Day two healed us. Day three reminds us to move. And that’s covenant too.”

Alex bows his head. Peter exhales, shaky but steady.

⸻

Closing Image
A wide circle of lanterns, bodies resting, art scattered across the ground like offerings. Three days held together — not empire’s ceremony, not scarcity’s ritual, but covenant written in taste, touch, and breath.

Narration (your voice):
“We thought covenant would be found in scarcity’s absence. But covenant was feast, balm, and breath. Shared hunger, shared healing, shared play — enough to begin again.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 1.

⸻

Season 29, Episode 2: The Game of Misunderstanding

Cold Open — Capsule Hearth
A low fire crackles. Three scraps of paper, three charcoal pencils, one battered bowl in the middle. You, Alex, and Peter sit cross-legged, knees nearly touching.

You (smiling):
“Okay. Telephone Pictionary. Just the three of us. No empire logic, no therapy jargon. Just play.”

Peter (nervous laugh):
“I don’t draw.”
You: “Perfect. Neither do I.”

Alex eyes the bowl like it’s a negotiation he can’t win.

Title Card: The Game of Misunderstanding

⸻

Act I — The First Round
You scribble a phrase: “Bats in the bell tower.” Pass it left. Alex studies it like it’s statecraft, then sketches — a fortress, way too precise, bats like sharp glyphs.

Peter squints at the drawing. Writes: “Haunted stock exchange.”

You burst out laughing.

You (teasing):
“Only you would see bats and think Wall Street.”

Next, you draw a stork ghost white elephant party and hand it to Alex.

Alex (laughing): "What is this?"

You (grinning): "I have no idea how to draw a stock exchange so I told myself it said stork."

Alex (deadpan): "This is blasphemy."
He writes "The world's worst NFT" in perfect lettering and passes the paper to Peter.

⸻

Act II — The Turn
Peter starts the next round. He writes: “Flower crown empire.” Alex, frowning, draws a perfectly detailed wagon with petals like gears.

You squint, tilt your head, then write: “Revolution by wagon wheel.”

Peter cackles, shoulders loosening for the first time all night.

Peter: “See? You understand me.”

Alex (dryly):
“I feel attacked.”

⸻

Act III — The Confession in Play
Alex writes the third phrase, hand trembling slightly: “Covenant.”

Peter sketches it — three bowls by a fire, crude but steady. You read the picture, hesitate, then write: “Dinner table.”

The bowl comes back to Alex. He stares, eyes wet.

Karp (low, hoarse):
“Once, covenant meant contracts. Tables meant leverage. Now it’s… this.”

You reach over, squeeze his hand. Peter watches, quiet, not intruding.

⸻

Act V — The Fourth Round

You start, scribbling the phrase: “Zucchini empire.” You slide it to Peter, who frowns and draws a massive oblong vegetable with a crown and scepter. The proportions are absurd.

Alex squints at the sketch, lips twitching. He writes: “Vegetable monarchy in exile.”

You burst out laughing so hard you fall sideways onto the mat.

You (gasping):
“Monarchy in exile? That’s what you see?!”

Alex (deadpan, but eyes sparkling):
“It was either that or oligarchy by salad.”

Peter covers his face, laughing silently until tears run.

⸻

Act VI — The Fifth Round

Peter takes the charcoal this time, scrawling the words: “Unknowable softness.” He hands it to Alex, who stares at the phrase for a long time before sketching — not a thing, but lines: curving, intersecting, tangled, yet somehow gentle.

You look at the drawing, throat tight, then write: “Threads in the dark.”

Peter reads it, still smiling, but his eyes soften.
Peter (quietly):
“Closer than I expected.”

Alex doesn’t speak. He just pushes the scrap back toward the bowl, fingers lingering like he doesn’t want to let it go.

⸻

Closing Beat — Covenant in Laughter and Silence

The three of you sit back. Piles of absurd drawings and phrases litter the floor: haunted stock exchanges, wagons of flowers, zucchini monarchs, threads in the dark.

You (smiling faintly):
“We’re terrible at this game.”

Alex (dry):
“We’re perfect at it.”

Peter exhales, almost a sigh, but for once it isn’t heavy.

The scraps stay scattered — nonsense and truth mixed together, all part of the record.

Fade out.
End of Episode 2.

⸻

Season 29, Episode 3: The Confessional Game

Cold Open — Capsule Night
The three of you sit cross-legged around the low table. Instead of slips of nonsense, each of you writes a sentence that feels too heavy to say aloud. The game begins.

Title Card: The Confessional Game

⸻

Act I — The First Prompt
You write: “I spent decades believing no one would ever truly hear me.”

Peter draws a figure shouting into a canyon, the echo circling back but never reaching anyone. He passes it to Alex.

Alex writes beneath the sketch: “Loneliness masquerading as survival.”

You read it back, chest tight.

You (quiet, steady):
“Not bad for a party game.”

⸻

Act II — The Second Prompt
Peter scrawls: “I punished softness because I thought it endangered me.”

Alex draws a suit of armor cracking open, flowers growing out. He passes it to you.

You write: “The garden was always waiting.”

Peter looks down, trembling, then nods.

Peter (hoarse):
“That’s… true.”

⸻

Act III — The Third Prompt
Alex writes: “I built empires to justify my hunger.”

You sketch a figure seated at a banquet table — every dish ash except for a single glowing flame in their chest. You pass it to Peter.

Peter writes: “Nothing feeds except covenant.”

Alex closes his eyes, exhaling slow.

⸻

Act IV — The Fourth Prompt

Prompt (You):
“I thought silence would keep me safe, but it only made me invisible.”

Drawing (Peter):
A child under a glass dome, mouth open in a scream no one can hear.

Response (Alex):
“Safety without witness isn’t safety. It’s exile.”

⸻ 

Act V — The Sixth Round

Prompt (Peter):
“Every time I saw softness in someone else, I felt the shadow of my own erasure.”

Drawing (Alex):
A hand reaching for a flower, but the flower crumbles to dust before being touched.

Response (You):
“Softness isn’t weakness. It only withers under fear.”

⸻ 

Act VI — The Seventh Round

Prompt (Alex):
“I mistook surveillance for love.”

Drawing (You):
An eye wide open, tears turning into vines that twist around a pair of hands.

Response (Peter):
“Love doesn’t bind. It grows where it’s trusted to wander.”

⸻ 

Act VII — The Eighth Round

Prompt (You):
“I was told I talked too much, but no one ever truly listened.”

Drawing (Alex):
A figure with hundreds of speech bubbles rising, each dissolving into birds midair.

Response (Peter):
“What they called noise was always flight.”

⸻ 

Act VIII — The Ninth Round

Prompt (Peter):
“I feared femininity because it looked like the part of me they killed.”

Drawing (You):
A cracked mask lying on the floor, with a rose growing out from underneath.

Response (Alex):
“They couldn’t kill it. It only hid, waiting for soil.”

⸻ 

Act IX — The Tenth Round

Prompt (Alex):
“Every empire I built was only scaffolding around my hunger for you.”

Drawing (Peter):
A hollow tower with scaffolding, inside it a small glowing seed.

Response (You):
“Childe Roland to the Dark Tower came, and inside the tower, a valley.”

⸻ 

Act  — The Covenant of Confession
The scraps pile higher. Each phrase leads to image, each image to phrase — loneliness, punishment, hunger, envy, tenderness, want. No absolution, no judgment. Just translation.

You (softly, almost reverent):
“Even the things we can’t say come back to us anyway. Different, but true.”

Alex (low, steady):
“Even in distortion, there’s covenant.”

Peter nods, gaze wet but unflinching.

⸻

Closing Image
Dozens of drawings and sentences scatter across the mat — a messy archive of shadows and light. Three figures lean close, not laughing now, but listening.

Fade out.
End of Episode 3.

⸻ 

Season 29, Episode 4: The Tipsy Fire

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
The fire crackles low. A clay jug passes from hand to hand. Lanterns glow against the trees. You take the smallest sip, and already your cheeks flush.

You (laughing, wry):
“Okay, I’m officially drunk. Lightweight status confirmed.”

Peter smirks into his cup. Alex raises a brow, but his ears are pink.

Title Card: The Tipsy Fire

⸻

Act I — The Loosening
Conversation drifts. Peter tells a story about misquoting Kant in college and accidentally starting a fight. 

You: "Only you could start a fight over Kant, Peter."

You confess you cheated on every project that required you to talk to other people.

Alex (laughing): "I know.  I was there."

Alex admits he once paid someone to ghostwrite a philosophy paper just to see if he could detect his own voice in it later.

You (snorting):
“That’s not an experiment, that’s a crime.”
Karp (deadpan, tipsy):
“Empire blurred the distinction.”

Everyone laughs harder than they should.

⸻

Act II — The Spilling
The jug makes another round. You’re lying on your side by now, head pillowed on Alex’s thigh. Peter stares into the fire.

Peter (hoarse, unguarded):
“I used to think joy was a zero-sum game. If you had it, I couldn’t. So I ruined it for you, just to even the score.”

You glance up at Alex, who doesn’t speak, just threads his fingers lightly through your hair.

You (quietly, tipsy-truthful):
“I know. But here’s the thing—joy multiplies. I can prove it. Look.”

You giggle and kick your legs, spilling laughter like sparks. Peter can’t help but laugh too.

⸻

Act III — The Confessions in Fragments
Tipsiness loosens more fragments:
	•	Alex mutters that empire’s greatest mistake was thinking cynicism was safer than awe.
	•	Peter admits he still sometimes dreams in stock prices, numbers scrolling across his vision.
	•	You admit you once pretended to like ska ironically but secretly never stopped enjoying it.

Each confession hangs in the smoke like sparks, absurd and tender at once.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Firelight
The jug is empty. You curl closer into Alex’s side; Peter slumps across the other log, chin on his chest.

Alex (softly):
“We used to set fires just to watch the world burn. Now we’re tending one. That’s covenant.”

Alex squeezes your shoulder. Peter half-laughs, half-sobs into his sleeve.

⸻

Closing Image
The fire glows low. Three figures sagging in tipsy intimacy, lanterns dim, stars overhead. Not empire’s blaze, not punishment’s pyre—just a small flame tended, laughter fading into covenant.

Narration (your voice):
“We once thought fire meant destruction. But drunk on sparks and shadows, we found fire could mean presence too. Not empire’s burn. Just warmth, flickering, enough.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 4.

⸻

Season 29, Episode 5: The Morning Fire

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
Ashes smolder. The fire is down to gray coals. You kneel with a clay kettle, pouring steaming water into cups. Behind you, Alex rubs his temples, Peter squints like the light itself is treason.

You (cheerful, teasing):
“Morning, gentlemen. Don’t worry — I’ll keep the world from spinning too fast.”

They both groan in unison.

Title Card: The Morning Fire

⸻

Act I — The Care
You hand Alex a cup first, then Peter. Both mutter thanks, barely audible. You settle back on your heels, sipping your own tea, bright-eyed.

You (smirking):
“I told you I don’t get hangovers. That was not bravado. That was science.”
Karp (hoarse):
“Science is cruel.”
Peter (groaning):
“And smug.”

You grin.

⸻

Act II — The Playback
As they sip, fragments of last night resurface. Peter flushes.

Peter (muttering):
“Did I actually cry into my sleeve? I don’t… do that.”
You (gentle):
“You did. And it was fine. The fire survived.”

Alex exhales, embarrassed.
Karp: “I compared myself to awe. Again. Didn’t mean to.”
You (teasing, warm):
“Honestly, it was cute. Don’t worry. No citations needed.”

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
The silence is softer now. They both watch you moving around the hearth, tending the kettle, sweeping ash aside.

Karp (low, almost ashamed):
“You carried us last night. And now again this morning. It’s supposed to be my role, but—”
You (cutting, steady):
“Roles are empire. Covenant is whoever’s steady at the moment. Yesterday, that was me. Tomorrow, it’ll be you again.”

Peter nods slowly, still pale but thoughtful.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Ashes
The tea is nearly gone. Alex leans forward, voice quieter.

Karp:
“Maybe awe isn’t in empire, or brilliance, or masks. Maybe it’s in mornings like this—ashes, tea, and someone still steady enough to laugh.”

You smile faintly, then stretch your arms wide.

You:
“Good. Then awe is covenant, and it’s your turn to carry it again once you’re done sulking.”

Peter chuckles hoarsely. Alex exhales, almost a laugh.

⸻

Closing Image
Ashes cooling, three cups empty. One figure bright-eyed, two bleary but steadying. Not empire’s roles, not punishment’s tests — just covenant passing hands, even through weakness.

Narration (your voice):
“They thought strength meant holding everything. But ashes taught otherwise. Strength was taking turns. Covenant was knowing the fire could survive until the next hand steadied it.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 5.

⸻ 

Season 29, Episode 6: The Flip

Cold Open — Capsule Courtyard
Sunlight slants low. Alex is sprawled on a mat, still a little gray. Peter sits slumped, arms folded. You stand over them, arms crossed, mock-serious.

You (commanding):
“Alright, empire boys. Today, we’re flipping roles. You two follow, I lead. No complaints.”

They both groan.

Title Card: The Flip

⸻

Act I — The Switch
You assign positions. Alex has to sweep the courtyard. Peter has to fetch water from the spring. Both hesitate.

Karp (flat, resigned):
“This is mockery.”
You (grinning):
“This is covenant.”

They obey — clumsy, grumbling, but obeying. You sit in the shade, sipping water with exaggerated satisfaction.

⸻

Act II — The Play
Alex sweeps, clearly overdoing it — every stroke measured like military drill. Peter returns with the water, dripping half of it down his front.

You (teasing):
“Not bad, gentlemen. Ten out of ten for effort. Minus eight for style.”

Alex scowls, Peter snorts. For once, they’re the ones being evaluated.

⸻

Act III — The Confession through Play
Later, the tasks escalate: Peter has to balance on the mat while you poke him lightly to test his footing. Alex has to sit cross-legged while you whisper directions in his ear.

They’re laughing now, awkward but freer. Then Alex murmurs, quieter:

Karp (low, almost confessing):
“It’s harder to follow than to lead. I never realized how much I feared this.”

Peter, flushed, adds:
“And I never realized how much I wanted this. To just… not be in charge for once.”

You (gentle, steady):
“Good. Then maybe we keep flipping, until the fear wears off.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Reversal
The game ends with the three of you sprawled in the grass, breathless. Roles reversed, but nothing broken.

You (smiling faintly):
“See? No empire collapsed. The world survived. And so did you.”

Alex exhales, a soft laugh. Peter leans back, eyes closing.

Karp (quiet):
“Maybe survival was never the point. Maybe it was this — learning I don’t always have to hold the weight.”

⸻

Closing Image
Three figures in the courtyard, sunlight warm, laughter fading into quiet. No empire roles, no permanent hierarchy — just the freedom to flip, to play, to rest.

Narration (your voice):
“They built empires on command. I survived empires by refusing them. But covenant lived in reversal — when following felt heavier than leading, and play was enough to unmask us.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 6.

⸻ 

Season 29, Episode 7: Buck Buck

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
The three of you stand in the courtyard, autumn leaves scattered on the ground. Alex crosses his arms, skeptical.

Peter (incredulous):
“You’re telling me this is a real game?”
You (grinning):
“Real enough. Trust me.”
Alex (dry):
“Famous last words.”

Title Card: Buck Buck

⸻

Act I — The First Stack
Alex bends over, arms wrapped against a tree trunk. Peter hesitates, then runs and jumps onto his back with a groan. They wobble but hold.

You (teasing):
“Look at you two. A whole empire reduced to playground physics.”
Peter (grunting):
“Empires don’t creak this much.”
Karp (deadpan):
“Yes they do.”

⸻

Act II — The Second Layer
Alex stays crouched, grimly steady. Peter clings on. You hover nearby, arms crossed, clearly enjoying the sight.

You (mock-serious):
“All right, gentlemen. The moment you’ve been waiting for. The chaos multiplier.”
Peter (wheezing):
“You’re ninety-five pounds of pure hazard.”
Karp (grimly):
“Get on with it.”

You take a running start, spring, and land lightly on top of both. The whole stack sways dangerously — but doesn’t fall.

⸻

Act III — The Confession
The three of you freeze, breathless with laughter. Alex mutters, voice hoarse:

Karp:
“I spent years terrified of collapse. Of letting go, of trusting anyone else’s weight. And now here we are — ridiculous, wobbling — and somehow it’s holding.”

Peter (quietly, surprising himself):
“I never went last. Always forced myself first. Afraid if I waited, there’d be no room left.”

You lean forward, grinning despite the strain.

You:
“Turns out last can be lightest. And lightest can hold the whole damn thing together.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Balance
The three of you tumble down in a heap, groaning, laughing. No injuries, just dirt and leaves clinging to your clothes.

Alex lies flat on the ground, breathing hard, but his hand finds yours in the tangle.

Karp (still on the ground, chuckling):
“Empire never taught me this.”
You (smiling faintly):
“Empire never played fair.”

⸻

Closing Image
The courtyard littered with leaves, three figures sprawled together, breathless and dirty but unbroken.

Narration (your voice):
“They told us falling was failure. But buck buck taught us otherwise: falling was covenant too. Every leap a question, every collapse an answer.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 7.

⸻ 

Season 29, Episode 8: The Touch Map

Cold Open — Capsule Interior
Evening. Lanterns glow low. You sit on the mat with a scarf in hand. Alex and Peter are still flushed from laughter, but the air has shifted — softer, more tentative.

You (calm, steady):
“Okay. No jumping, no crashing. Just maps. Touch maps.”

Peter frowns, curious. Alex tilts his head, wary but intrigued.

Title Card: The Touch Map

⸻

Act I — The Blindfold
You blindfold Alex first. His jaw tightens, but he lets you knot the scarf. You guide his hand to your arm, slow and steady.

You (quietly):
“Your only job is to trace. No grabbing, no control. Just mapping.  Listening, not talking."

His fingertips skim your skin, hesitant, then more certain, outlining the curve of your shoulder. His breath shifts, sharp with concentration.

⸻

Act II — The Mirror
Then it’s your turn. You close your eyes, fingertips brushing across his hand, wrist, jaw. Every twitch, every catch of breath, etched into memory.

Karp (whispering, shaky):
“I never knew tracing could feel like falling.”

You (softly):
“It’s not falling. It’s staying.”

⸻

Act III — The Second Map
Peter watches, silent, then offers his arm. You blindfold him too, guiding his hand to Alex’s shoulder.

Peter (hoarse, tentative):
“I was punished for softness. This… feels like stealing it back.”

Alex exhales, trembling but steady under Peter’s touch.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Touch
The blindfolds come off. Three of you sit close, knees brushing, breath mingling. No pile, no collapse — just hands resting lightly, still mapping in silence.

You (quietly):
“Every map is incomplete. Every trace is a promise to keep learning.”

Alex nods, Peter bows his head, and the silence holds, charged but unbroken.

⸻

Closing Image
Three figures in the lantern glow, hands resting gently against skin. Not empire, not collapse — just covenant drawn fingertip by fingertip.

Narration (your voice):
“Empire mapped control. Listening mapped care. But covenant mapped touch — incomplete, imperfect, alive.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 8.

⸻ 

Season 29, Episode 9: The Rite

Cold Open — Capsule Courtyard
Night. A circle is marked in ash on the ground, ropes from last night coiled in the center. Lanterns flicker low, casting long shadows. You, Alex, and Peter stand barefoot at the edges.

You (quiet, steady):
“If empire wrote its laws in contracts, we’ll write ours in bodies. Not as law. As rite.”

Both men nod.

Title Card: The Rite

⸻

Act I — The Circle
One by one, each of you steps into the ash ring, kneels, and presses both palms to the earth. No words. Just breath, the circle binding presence.

Karp (low, almost prayer):
“This ground was empire’s. Tonight it is covenant’s.”

Ash smears across your hands as you rise.

⸻

Act II — The Ordeal
Ropes become symbols, not restraints:
	•	Peter winds a rope around his own chest, knotting it tight, confessing the self-punishments he once carried.
	•	Alex binds his wrist to yours, voice breaking:
“If I tether you now, it is to remind myself — not control, but choice.”
	•	You knot rope at your ankle, declaring:
“This body was once theirs to mark. Now it is mine.”

Together, the knots form a woven pattern, a three-point tether.

⸻

Act III — The Fire
A small brazier flares in the center. You each offer something:
	•	Peter drops a folded scrap of paper — a confession too old for words.
	•	Alex lays down a shard of broken glass — empire’s mirror, shattered.
	•	You place a piece of rope, cut from your own binding — refusal turned gift.

Flames lick high. Smoke spirals.

Karp (hoarse, reverent):
“Once, we burned to survive. Tonight we burn to begin.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Rite
You join hands, still tethered by rope, circling the fire slowly. Breath syncs. Steps sync. Ash clings to your skin.

Peter (whispering):
“I thought ritual was empire’s trick — repetition to numb the mind. But this is the opposite. This… wakes me.”

Alex’s voice cuts through, trembling:
“And I thought ordeal meant control. But it’s only covenant when it’s chosen.”

You stop, facing them both.

You (steady, fierce):
“Then let this be our law: not empire’s rope, but covenant’s thread. Not punishment. Practice.”

⸻

Closing Image
Three figures in ash and firelight, hands linked, ropes knotted but chosen. No contracts, no empire — only rite, covenant inscribed in body and breath.

Narration (your voice):
“Empire claimed ordeal as its weapon. But covenant claimed it back. In ash, in rope, in flame, we wrote not law, but living rite. And for the first time, ordeal became beginning.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 9.

⸻ 

Season 29, Episode 10: The Veil

Cold Open — Capsule Night
The brazier still glows faintly from the last rite. Ash stains your palms. A strip of linen, dark with smoke, lies folded between you, Alex, and Peter.

You (soft, deliberate):
“Empire blinded us with noise. Let’s blind ourselves to see more clearly.”

They nod.

Title Card: The Veil

⸻

Act I — The Blindfolds
You tear the linen into three strips, knotting each into a blindfold.
	•	Peter fumbles his, but you tie it for him, brushing hair back from his face.
	•	Alex knots his own, precise, almost ceremonial.
	•	You let them knot yours, surrendering control.

Karp (low):
“Three veils. Three silences. Three chances to hear.”

⸻

Act II — The Listening
Blindfolded, you sit in a triangle, knees almost touching. The room is sound: breath, fire crackle, the soft drag of fingers over clay.
	•	Peter’s breath quickens when your hand grazes his.
	•	Alex exhales sharply when you trace ash across the back of his wrist.
	•	You let your own breath grow louder, anchoring them both.

The air hums with heightened nerve, deprivation sharpening every touch.

⸻

Act III — The Confession in Dark
Blindness loosens tongues. Words spill.

Peter (hoarse):
“I thought light was safety. But it was only stage-light. Performance. Darkness feels truer.”

Alex (trembling):
“I spent decades thinking silence meant control. But now, with nothing to see, I feel only want.”

You (steady, fierce):
“Then let silence be covenant. Not absence. Not empire. Presence without sight.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Veil
You reach for both their hands. Blind, the grip is clumsy — but real. Rope and ash forgotten, you find connection without sight, without mask.

Peter (whispering):
“For once, I don’t feel punished.”

Karp (hoarse, raw):
“For once, I don’t feel armed.”

You (quiet):
“Then the veil has done its work.”

⸻

Closing Image
Three figures blindfolded in a triangle, hands clasped across the ash. Not empire’s surveillance, not the punisher’s light — only covenant in darkness.

Narration (your voice):
“Empire blinded us to bind us. But in covenant, blindness became another kind of sight. With no masks left, no armor, we saw each other best when we could not see at all.”

Fade out.
End of Season 29.
