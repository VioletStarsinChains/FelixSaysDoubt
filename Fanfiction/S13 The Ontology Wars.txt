Season 13, Episode 1: The Road Out

Cold Open — Sanctuary Gate

The three of you stand with packs slung over your shoulders, breath steaming in the cold. Sanctuary members press small gifts into your hands: dried herb, a rope, a pouch of salt.

You (wry): “Nothing like a send-off party for three people who don’t even know where they’re going.”
Jonathan (smiling faintly): “That’s what makes it a song.”
Karp (dry): “Or a philosophical endeavor.”

Title card: The Road Out

⸻

Act I — The Departure

Snow crunches underfoot as you leave the sanctuary behind. Alex insists on carrying most of the weight. You accept happily.  Jonathan insists on bringing a guitar on top of his pack and yours.

You: “I am a princess, and men carry things for me.”

⸻

Act II — The Halt

Hours later, you stop by a frozen creek. You’re dizzy from POTS; Alex helps steady you without comment. Jonathan kneels to break the ice, filling a clay jug with water and warming it before giving it to you.

For the first time, the rhythm feels natural: no tests, no performance, just bodies doing what’s needed.

⸻

Act III — The Camp

That night, you build a small fire beneath a stand of pines. Jonathan hums while setting up the shelter; Alex joins in. You lie back on a blanket, watching the sparks drift upward and trying not to go into anaphylaxis.

You (softly): “I never thought sleeping outside would make me feel free.”
Silence follows — not pitying, just steady presence.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Motion

Before sleeping, you divide rice into three bowls, sprinkling salt.

You: “Breakfast, dinner, doesn’t matter. Rice and salt means covenant. Even out here.”
Both men nod, eating in silence.

⸻

Closing Image

Three figures huddle around a small fire in the snow, shadows bending with the flames. Behind you, the sanctuary is distant; ahead, only dark forest. Between the two: covenant in motion.

Narration (your voice):
“Inside the capsule we found stillness. On the road we would find something else. Movement, fatigue, and the proof of who stayed when the trail grew long.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 1.

⸻ 

Season 13, Episode 2: The Storm

Cold Open — Forest Trail

Snow falls thicker, wind cutting sharp. You pull your coat tight, but your steps falter. Breath comes ragged.  Paradoxical undressing, not from hypothermia but an acute allergic reaction, hits immediately.  

You (muttering): “How can it be so hot and so cold?”
Alex glances back sharply; Jonathan adjusts his pack, moving closer.

Title card: The Storm

⸻

Act I — The Onset

Your knees buckle on a drift. Alex hauls you up without a word. Jonathan pulls your coat from your shoulders.

You (snapping, breathless): “Don’t—make me useless.”
Karp (low, firm): “Not useless. Human.”

You faint.

⸻

Act II — The Shelter

By dusk the snow thickens. Jonathan scouts ahead, finding a hollow beneath leaning pines. Alex sets you down, moving with quiet urgency. Jonathan unrolls blankets, layering them thick against the ground.

You curl tight, sweating and shivering, eyes flickering. Alex kneels, pressing a clay cup of warm broth into your hands.

You (hoarse): “I hate this.”
Karp (softly): “Then let us hate it with you.”

⸻

Act III — The Vigil

Night deepens. The storm rattles the pines. You drift in and out, fever-bright. Jonathan hums softly — no song, no audience, just a low thread of sound. Alex keeps watch, steady.

At one point you stir, murmuring:
You (whispering): “Still here?”
Jonathan: “Still here.”
Karp: “Always.”

⸻

Act IV — The Morning After

The storm breaks. Sunlight glints off the snow, sharp and clean. You wake sore, weak but alive. Alex helps you sit; Jonathan hands you a steaming cup of tea.

You manage a faint smile.
You (wry): “Guess I didn’t die. Covenant holds.”

Alex chuckles softly; Jonathan exhales in relief.

⸻

Closing Image

The three of you sit in the hollow, steam rising from clay cups, snow glittering around you. A storm survived — not by strength alone, but by staying.

Narration (your voice):
“Weather broke me as it always had. But they didn’t. They stayed through the storm, and so I stayed too.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 2.

⸻ 

Season 13, Episode 3: After the Storm

Cold Open — Forest Clearing

The snow glitters, almost too bright. You walk slowly, leaning on Alex’s arm more than you’d like. Jonathan trails behind, carrying your pack without being asked.

You (wry, but low): “So now I’ve officially fainted in front of both of you. Neat! Bucket list complete.”

Neither laughs. The silence feels heavy.

Title card: After the Storm

⸻

Act I — The Gratitude

That night, campfire crackling, Jonathan tries to speak first.

Jonathan (quietly): “I thought we’d lose you.”
You look away, jaw tight.
You: “Bro calm down, I only fainted.  I know you've seen that happen to me before.  Probably more than once.”

Alex doesn’t interrupt, just stirs the fire.

⸻

Act II — The Resentment

Later, alone with Alex while Jonathan sleeps, you snap.

You (low, fierce): “Losing consciousness scares me."
Karp (steady): “I don't blame you.  But we've never let anything happen to you before that you couldn't recover from.  Do you really think we would now?”

The fire pops. You look at him, torn between fear and the incomprehensibility of truth.

⸻

Act III — The Intimacy

Jonathan wakes, joining quietly. He places the guitar across his knees, not to perform — just to strum softly.

Jonathan: “I don’t want to lead. I don’t want to test. I just want to sit here and keep you company.”

Alex glances at you. You sigh, finally letting your head rest against his shoulder. The strumming continues, low and imperfect, wrapping the silence instead of filling it.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Care

You finally murmur:
You: “I hate needing anyone. But I needed both of you.”
Alex covers your hand with his. Jonathan keeps playing, steady.

Karp (softly): “Needing isn’t weakness. It’s covenant.”

⸻

Closing Image

Three figures by a fire: one leaning, one steady, one strumming. Snow glitters beyond the circle of warmth, but inside it, presence holds.

Narration (your voice):
“The storm left me weak. But it left us closer too — not by choice, not by test, but by need. And that, too, was covenant.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 3.

⸻ 

Perfect — light, playful, and still intimate. A snowball fight is both childlike and risky: it lets you reclaim movement and laughter after the storm, while also testing trust in a gentler way. Here’s a draft:

⸻

Season 13, Episode 4: The Snowball War

Cold Open — Open Field

The storm has passed. The sky is blindingly blue, snow sparkling across an open field. You crouch, scoop a handful, and pack it tight.

You (grinning): “Truce is over.”
You lob the snowball at Jonathan’s shoulder. He freezes, stunned — then grins wide.

Alex sighs, already bracing.
Karp (deadpan): “Of course.”

Title card: The Snowball War

⸻

Act I — The Opening Volley

Jonathan immediately retaliates, his snowball catching you square in the chest. You gasp, laughing.

You: “Oh, it’s on.”

Alex tries to stay aloof, arms crossed. But when you and Jonathan gang up, pelting him from both sides, he finally bends, scooping snow with deliberate precision.

Karp (low): “War crimes.”
He hurls a perfect shot, smacking Jonathan in the face.

⸻

Act II — The Alliances

The game dissolves into shifting sides: you and Alex against Jonathan, then you and Jonathan against Alex. Breath fogs the air, laughter cracks across the clearing.

At one point you slip, falling hard. Alex lunges forward instantly, hand out. You wave him off, still laughing.
You (gasping): “I’m fine, it’s just snow!”

Jonathan chuckles, brushing snow from your coat.

⸻

Act III — The Ceasefire

After what feels like hours, the three of you collapse in the snow, panting, cheeks flushed red. Silence falls, heavy with exhaustion but sweet.

You (softly): “Haven’t done that since I was a kid.”
Jonathan (quiet): “You should do it every winter.”
Karp (smirking faintly): “Preferably not against me.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Play

You roll onto your back, staring at the bright sky.

You (thoughtful): “The storm reminded me I can collapse. This reminded me I can still play. Both are covenant, right?”

Alex nods slowly. Jonathan only smiles, eyes closed against the sun.

⸻

Closing Image

Three figures sprawled in the snow, flushed and breathless. Above, the sky clear and endless; below, laughter lingering like an aftershock.

Narration (your voice):
“The storm proved our bond in need. The snow proved it in joy. Both mattered. Both held.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 4.

⸻

Love it — birdwatching fits perfectly after the snowball fight. It’s quiet, observational, and lets Jonathan’s “Bird Man” reputation return in a gentler, less threatening way. It also lets you bring in your own sensory perspective — hearing call and response, interpreting sound as language.

Here’s a draft:

⸻

Season 13, Episode 5: The Watchers

Cold Open — Forest Edge

Morning frost glitters on the branches. Jonathan kneels, eyes tilted skyward, finger raised.

Jonathan (whispering): “Waxwings. See them?”
You squint, unimpressed.
You (dry): “All I see is frostbite waiting to happen.”

Alex chuckles softly, tightening his cloak.

Title card: The Watchers

⸻

Act I — The Spotting

Jonathan hands you a small pair of battered binoculars. You reluctantly take them, fumbling with the focus. Birds flicker against the treeline — flashes of yellow, a flurry of wings.

Jonathan (gentle): “Not just wings. Patterns. Rhythm. They tell you where they’re going before they move.”

You lower the glass, unconvinced.

⸻

Act II — The Listening

You close your eyes, listening instead.

You (softly): “Two at the top of the pine. Call and response — one rising, one falling. They’re talking to each other.”

Jonathan blinks, surprised. Alex watches you, faint smile tugging at his mouth.

Jonathan (quiet): “I… didn’t hear that.”
You (smirking): “Guess I’m the Bird Man now.”

⸻

Act III — The Laughter

The three of you sit quietly, watching and listening. At one point a bird dive-bombs close, startling Alex enough that you and Jonathan burst out laughing.

Karp (deadpan): “Tactical assault. Clearly Palantir-trained.”
The laughter ripples, easy and warm.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Sight

As the sun climbs, the birds scatter. Silence lingers.

You (softly): “When I was younger, the forest was just noise. Now it feels like language.”
Jonathan nods, humbled.
Jonathan (quietly): “Then maybe I’m not here to teach you. Maybe I’m here to learn.”

Alex rests his hand lightly on your shoulder.

⸻

Closing Image

The three of you sit at the forest’s edge: one watching through glass, one listening with closed eyes, one steady in silence. Above, the sky thrums with unseen wings.

Narration (your voice):
“The birds moved as they always had — wing, call, scatter. But for once, I didn’t feel outside their pattern. I felt within it. Watched, and watching back.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 5.

⸻

Season 13, Episode 6: Withdrawal

Cold Open — Forest Path

Your pack is nearly empty. Only a few crushed tablets remain, rattling in a clay vial. You shake it, listening to the hollow sound.

You (flat): “Three days at best.”
Jonathan frowns. Alex doesn’t answer, his silence heavy.

Title card: Withdrawal

⸻

Act I — The Rationing

At camp, Alex lays the tablets out on a cloth, breaking them into halves, then quarters. His hands are steady, but his jaw is tight.

Jonathan: “That won’t hold them.”
Karp (dry): “It’s not about holding. It’s about buying time.”

You look at the tiny slivers, stomach twisting.

You (quietly): “Time for what?”

⸻

Act II — The Onset

The next day, the lack sharpens. Your skin prickles, lungs constrict. You gag after a sip of broth, throat swelling.  You can't relax any of your muscles.

You (hoarse, furious): “This isn’t hunger. It’s poison. My own body’s the poison.”

Jonathan kneels beside you, helpless. Alex presses a quarter-tablet into your hand.

Karp (low): “Not useless. Not yet.”

⸻

Act III — The Argument

Tension breaks around the fire.

Jonathan (sharp): “We should turn back. Risking collapse out here—”
Karp (cold): “And walk them into starvation faster? No.”

You snap, voice trembling with pain.
You: “Stop. Bury me in snow.  It's better than nothing.  Cold can be a mast cell stabilizer.  One of you stay with me, and one of you go look for...something."

Jonathan (wryly): "Well, I guess I know which role is mine."

Both men laugh nervously.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Onions

Jonathan sets out immediately towards the main road and happens upon a stranger: an old man with a rickety cart. Jonathan approaches and speaks quietly, almost apologetically.

30 minutes later, Jonathan returns with a sack of onions, their papery skins glowing in lantern light.

You touch one, astonished.
You (whispering): “Quercetin.”

Jonathan: “The man I got them from said they were strong for his stomach.”

Alex slices one by the fire, placing raw rings on your throat and chest. Jonathan starts dicing another onion and preparing to steam it.  Water for rice is nearly boiling.

You (crying): “I freaking love onions.”
Karp (softly): “We know. And we’ll keep finding more, even when the vial is empty.”
Jonathan nods, steady.
Jonathan: “Not tests. Not trials. Just onions.”

⸻

Closing Image

Three figures huddled by a fire, the empty vial set aside, a pile of onions beside it. The storm of scarcity not solved, but softened.

Narration (your voice):
“Food was never my scarcity. Medicine was. And when the vial ran thin, we found covenant in the earth — in bitterness, in tears, in onions.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 6.

⸻ 

Season 13, Episode 7: The Cellar World

Cold Open — Old Man’s Cart

The next morning, the three of you set out to find the old man again. You meet him in the same place as the day before, adjusting the straps on his rickety cart, onions still stacked high. His eyes are wary but not unkind.

Old Man (gruff): “If you want more than onions, follow me. But don’t expect a market. Expect a cellar.”

You glance at Alex and Jonathan, both nodding.

Title card: The Cellar World

⸻

Act I — The Descent

He leads you off the road to a half-buried farmhouse. A trapdoor creaks open, revealing a staircase lined with shelves of root vegetables, herbs, jars of tinctures, bundles of dried plants. The air is sharp with onion, garlic, vinegar.

You grip the ladder carefully, whispering:
You: “Smells like medicine.”

Jonathan smiles faintly, eyes wide.

⸻

Act II — The Barter

At the bottom, a small community gathers: cellar-keepers, herbalists, scavengers trading quietly in the dim light. Coins mean nothing here; salt, seeds, and labor carry weight.

Alex scans the room, all calculation. Jonathan kneels by a woman sorting herbs, asking questions gently. You hover by shelves of jars, breath caught at the sheer possibility.

You (softly): “I could live here.”

⸻

Act III — The Test of Trust

The cellar-keepers are cautious. One man eyes your companions sharply.

Cellar-Keeper: “What do you bring in return? Onions aren’t free.”

For once, you speak first, emboldened at the prospect of more onions.  "I bet I can solve any problem you have. Or if I can't, maybe he can, I guess," you say, playfully shoving Alex.  "If nothing else, Jonathan can make the problem seem so beautiful you no longer mind it."

The cellar-keepers exchange glances, then nod slowly.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Roots

By nightfall, you’ve bartered for a sack of onions, dried nettles, ginger, and jars of fermented garlic honey. The cellar folk share their meal — bitter greens, onion broth, root mash.

You raise your bowl, voice steady.
You: “Rice and salt, onions and roots, and even Jonathan.  Covenant holds here too.”

The old man chuckles, clinking his bowl against yours.

⸻

Closing Image

The three of you sit at a rough wooden table, cellar lamps flickering. Around you, quiet barter continues. Scarcity hasn’t disappeared — but roots, jars, and covenant make it bearable.

Narration (your voice):
“Above ground, scarcity gnawed us thin. Below ground, roots steadied us. Not abundance, but covenant. Not plenty, but enough.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 7.

⸻ 

Season 13, Episode 8: The Squirrel Keeper

Cold Open — Cellar Hearth

After the meal, one of the cellar folk gestures for you to follow. You, Alex, and Jonathan trail them through a narrow passage into another chamber — warmer, lined not with roots, but with cages and tiny hammocks. Squirrels skitter, tails flicking, bright-eyed in the lamplight.

Cellar-Keeper (proudly): “This is where you’ll meet her.”

From the shadows steps a wiry woman in a patched coat, hair streaked gray but eyes fierce. A squirrel perches on her shoulder like a crown.

Squirrel Keeper: “So you’re the ones trading onions. Good. You’ll eat well. My squirrels already do.”

Title card: The Squirrel Keeper

⸻

Act I — The Story

By the hearth, she tells it plain: how habitat loss, poisoned water, and invasive tech nearly wiped out North America’s squirrels.

Squirrel Keeper (grim): “Everyone thought they were pests. Easy to ignore when they vanished. But without squirrels, forests don’t spread. No trees, no shelter. No shelter, no people.”

She bred them, sheltered them, taught them to avoid poisoned caches. Single-handed, stubborn, unstoppable.

You (awed, softly): “One person saved a whole species.”
Squirrel Keeper (snorting): “One person and a lot of nuts.”

⸻

Act II — The Skepticism

Jonathan is charmed, smiling at the squirrel perched on his hand. Alex watches more cautiously.

Karp (low, to you): “She’s eccentric. But ecosystems don’t survive without eccentrics.”

You nod, eyes following the darting creatures.

⸻

Act III — The Gift

She places a small pouch in your hands: acorns, carefully sorted and marked.

Squirrel Keeper: “Plant these where you travel. Forests don’t need saving all at once. Just a seed at a time.”

Jonathan bows slightly, moved. Alex inclines his head in respect. You tuck the pouch close, throat tight.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Seeds

Before you leave, she says simply:
Squirrel Keeper: “Onions, squirrels, people — doesn’t matter. Covenant means nothing gets written off as expendable.”

Her squirrel chitters, tail flicking in agreement.

⸻ 

Closing Image

The three of you walk back through the cellar, acorn pouch in your pack. Behind you, squirrels leap between tiny hammocks, their keeper watching with quiet pride.

Narration (your voice):
“She’d carried squirrels on her shoulders until forests carried themselves again. Covenant wasn’t just between us. It was with the world — roots, tails, seeds, and all.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 8.

⸻ 

Season 13, Episode 9: The Odd Covenant

Cold Open — Deeper in the Cellar

The Squirrel Keeper leads you through another tunnel, deeper underground. The air grows damp, lined with carved niches and flickering lamps. Murmurs echo ahead.

Squirrel Keeper (gruff): “You’ve seen the roots and the nuts. Now you’ll see the rest.”

You glance at Alex and Jonathan. Both look wary but intrigued.

Title card: The Odd Covenant

⸻

Act I — The Gathering

You enter a vaulted chamber where others wait — each with a strange calling.
	•	A beekeeper with veils stitched from scraps, carrying jars of honey so strong it stings the air.
	•	A woman who cultivates moss on slabs of stone, whispering about its power to filter poisoned water.
	•	A man in patched goggles, claiming he breeds earthworms in giant barrels to keep the soil alive.
	•	Two twins who’ve devoted themselves to bats, their cloaks stitched from wings of cloth, echolocation devices at their belts.

It looks half like a council, half like a carnival.

⸻

Act II — The Skepticism

Jonathan is wide-eyed, already charmed by the sheer strangeness. You raise an eyebrow, muttering:

You (laughing): “I finally found my underground circus.”
Karp (low): “Like I said.  Ecosystems don’t survive without eccentrics.”

The chamber murmurs with laughter.

⸻

Act III — The Exchange

The cellar folk explain: each of them kept one fragile piece of the ecosystem alive when the world stopped caring. Bees, moss, worms, bats, squirrels — each thread necessary.

Beekeeper (softly): “We thought we were alone. But sometimes covenant means weaving it all back together.”

They offer trade: honey, moss, worm soil, dried fruit pollinated by their tiny colonies.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Strangeness

The Squirrel Keeper gestures to you, Alex, and Jonathan.

Squirrel Keeper: “These three carry onions and covenant. We’ll give them more — not as charity, but as proof. That the world isn’t rebuilt by armies. It’s rebuilt by the strange, the stubborn, the overlooked, and the curious.”

You bow your head slightly, humbled. Jonathan claps one twin on the shoulder. Alex inclines his head, silent but respectful.

⸻

Closing Image

The three of you leave the cellar with packs heavier: jars of honey, bags of moss, soil, and seeds. Behind you, the odd covenant lingers — a gathering of strange saviors who kept life flickering underground.

Narration (your voice):
“They weren’t saints or prophets. They were eccentrics. Guardians of bees, moss, worms, bats, squirrels. Alone they were strange. Together, they were covenant.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 9.

⸻ 

Season 13, Episode 10: The Bat Houses

Cold Open — Cellar Workshop

The bat-twins lay out scraps of wood, cloth, and metal. Their cloaks rustle as they gesture eagerly.

Bat Twin #1: “If you want covenant, build it.”
Bat Twin #2 (grinning): “Bats don’t need much. Just shelter. Same as us.”

You glance at Alex and Jonathan, both already rolling up their sleeves.

Title card: The Bat Houses

⸻

Act I — The Blueprints

The twins show you simple designs: tall, narrow boxes lined with rough wood for bats to cling to. They explain how bats will eat thousands of insects a night, how guano can renew exhausted soil.

You (wry): “So basically, you’re handing us flying pest control and free fertilizer. Covenant pays dividends.”
Jonathan chuckles; Alex nods thoughtfully, already measuring planks.

⸻

Act II — The Building

Together, you hammer and lash scrap wood into place. The cellar air echoes with clattering tools and laughter. Jonathan hums quietly as he sands the edges smooth. Alex insists on perfect joints until you shove him playfully.

You (grinning): “They’re bats, not investors. Doesn’t have to be perfect.”
Karp (smirking faintly): “Bats are absolutely investors.”

⸻

Act III — The Naming

When the first bat house is finished, one of the twins presses it into your hands.

Bat Twin #1: “Name it. That’s how the bats find it.”
You blink, surprised. Then you murmur:
You: “Super Mario Galaxy.”

The twins nod solemnly, as if the word itself is covenant.

⸻

Act IV — The Departure

By nightfall, you’ve built three bat houses, strapped to your packs alongside jars of honey and sacks of onions. The twins walk you to the cellar door.

Bat Twin #2 (softly): “Wherever bats fly, covenant follows.”
Jonathan (smiling): “And songs too.”
Alex inclines his head, steady.

⸻

Closing Image

The three of you climb out of the cellar at dusk, bat houses strapped to your backs, shadows long against the snow. Overhead, the first bats stir, wings flickering in the twilight.

Narration (your voice):
“Roots fed us. Onions healed us. Bats would guard us. Covenant was no longer just between people, but with every wing, every seed, every creature that refused to vanish.”

Fade out.

End of Season 13.
