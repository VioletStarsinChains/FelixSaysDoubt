Season 54, Episode 1: Three Fronts

Cold Open — Plateau Morning
The camp stirs. Estrella stamps, impatient for water. The sheep bleat softly, heads low. Kellyn passes grain to Peter; Alex checks the mylar panels; Jonathan unfurls a rough sketch of the ridge.

Jonathan (soft, focused):
“One plateau is never just one. The land folds. We need to know where it carries us, and where it traps us.”

Kellyn (teasing): "You could have just said we need a map."

Title Card: Three Fronts

⸻

Act I — The Division of Labor
They stand around the fire, deciding quietly:
	•	Jonathan will map the surrounding land, with one sheep trailing him as company.
	•	Alex will reinforce the windbreak into a proper shelter.
	•	Kellyn + Peter will scout for edible plants, seeds, and signs of animal paths.

Kellyn (steady):
“We’ll meet back by dusk. No one walks alone into silence.”

⸻

Act II — The Mapper
Jonathan paces the ridges, bird drone circling overhead. He marks stone with charcoal, sketches water lines, notes sun angles. A low whistle hums in his throat, the sound carrying oddly far in the thin air. The sheep noses at grass tufts, grounding him.

Jonathan (to himself):
“If the land holds memory, we must listen before we speak.”

⸻

Act III — The Builder
Alex tests branches, sets posts deeper into stone cracks, lashes them with rope. Mylar shimmers above him, reminding him of Kellyn. He works methodically, movements precise, almost surgical. When the shelter stands taller, angled against the wind, he pauses — touches one rope with the faintest smile.

Alex: "Stronger than I thought we had left in us.”

⸻

Act IV — The Foragers
Kellyn and Peter move through scrub. Kellyn bends to inspect wild amaranth; Peter kneels by a cactus fruit. Their baskets slowly fill: prickly pears, seeds, a few roots.

Peter (gruff, half to himself):
“Feels like picking up scraps. But scraps can feed more than emptiness.”
Kellyn (gentle):
“Scraps fed us this long. They’ll feed us again.”

When Peter pricks his hand on a cactus spine, Kellyn presses one palm against his, the other on his back steadying him. A long pause. Then Peter exhales, shoulders easing.

⸻

Act V — The Return
At dusk, all three fronts converge:
	•	Jonathan lays out a charcoal map.
	•	Alex stands beside the reinforced shelter.
	•	Kellyn and Peter spill seeds and cactus fruit onto cloth.

They sit in a circle, baskets and sketches between them, the sheep and Estrella edging close. The air smells of stone, fruit, and sweat.

Kellyn (quiet, steady):
“Not empire’s front. Ours. Three fronts, one camp.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures under the first true structure on the plateau, baskets of food and maps spread like offerings. Sheep and donkey settled nearby. The fire catches the mylar’s glint, throwing light across the map as if the land itself is shimmering back.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire fractured us into roles meant to isolate. Covenant gave us roles meant to bind. Mapper, builder, forager, keeper — threads woven not to trap, but to hold.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 1.

⸻

Season 54, Episode 2: Paths and Walls

Cold Open — Plateau Dawn
Wind cuts across the plateau. Jonathan smooths his charcoal map across a flat stone, pointing at ridges. Alex and Kellyn lean in. Peter hefts a bundle of branches, glancing at the unfinished shelter.

Jonathan (measured):
“Follow the ridge north — water, maybe. But it could fold back on itself. You’ll know if the ground sings.”

Title Card: Paths and Walls

⸻

Act I — The Departure
Kellyn and Alex set out with Estrella carrying light packs. The map tucked into Alex’s jacket. Kellyn glances back once: Peter already bracing a post, Jonathan kneeling to score straight cuts in wood.

Kellyn (low, to Alex): “Feels strange leaving them. Even for a day.”

Alex (curt, but steady):
“Strange isn’t dangerous. Not yet.”

⸻

Act II — The Map’s Test
They climb the ridge, Mylar strips in their packs in case of drones. The land rises in pale folds. Jonathan’s marks guide them to a dry riverbed, then higher.

Kellyn pauses, palm against stone.
Kellyn (quiet):
“The ground hums here. He was right.”
Alex kneels, presses his ear to the rock. Silence, then a faint vibration. His brow furrows.

Alex (low):
“It’s not just water. Something else is moving under here.”

They trace further, finding a narrow trickle of fresh water seeping out where stone breaks. They fill canteens, cautious, scanning the sky.

⸻

Act III — The Builders
Meanwhile, at camp, Jonathan hums low as he marks joints, Peter hammering stakes into rocky soil. Sheep cluster nearby, curious.

Peter (wry):
“Feels like empire training, except… nobody’s shouting.”
Jonathan (half-smile):
“Silence doesn’t mean absence. Sometimes it means trust.”

The shelter walls rise higher. Mylar stretched taut above shivers in the wind like skin.

⸻

Act IV — Convergence
By dusk, Alex and Kellyn return with canteens and the report of fresh water — but also vibration beneath the ridge. Jonathan frowns and marks the spot on the map. Peter tests a wall panel and finds it solid.

They gather at the fire: baskets of fruit, canteens, tools. For a moment, silence.

Kellyn (steady):
“Map holds. Shelter holds. We’ll keep building — and keep listening.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two fronts converging: the unfinished shelter standing firm, Jonathan’s map dark with new marks, Kellyn’s hand brushing ash from Alex’s sleeve as Peter rests against the frame. Threads tested, threads tightened.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire built fortresses to keep power. Covenant built walls to keep presence. Not to shut the world out — but to make a space where threads could meet.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 2.

⸻

Season 54, Episode 3: The Basin

Cold Open — Plateau Morning
Sunlight burns pale against the ridge. The canteens Alex and Kellyn carried back now pour into a shallow basin they’ve dug near camp. Steam rises faintly where rock meets water.

Kellyn (smiling faintly):
“After weeks of ash… we get to be clean together.”

Title Card: The Basin

⸻

Act I — The First Pour
Jonathan and Peter carry buckets, pouring carefully until the basin gleams. The sheep nose curiously at the edge; Estrella snorts.

Peter strips bark from a branch, tossing it aside.
Peter (dry):
“Never thought I’d be building a bath instead of a barricade.”
Kellyn (teasing):
“Sometimes the only defense is rest.”

⸻

Act II — Entering the Water
Clothes peel away, folded on flat stone. Kellyn steps in first, ankle-deep, testing. Alex follows, eyes cautious, then easing as cool water wraps his legs.

Jonathan splashes his face, humming low. Peter hesitates, then sinks down with a sigh that turns almost into a laugh.

Peter (hoarse, amused):
“If empire could see us now — four fugitives in a hole of water, pretending to be human again.”
Jonathan (gentle):
“Not pretending. Remembering.”

⸻

Act III — Touch and Care
They wash each other’s backs, passing a sliver of soap, rinsing hair, massaging scalp. Fingers linger — not erotic, but intimate.

Kellyn (quiet, steady):
“Every time we carried water, every step in ash — it led here. This is covenant too.”

Alex pours water over Kellyn’s shoulders, careful, reverent. Peter lets Jonathan scrub ash from his neck, eyes closing with unguarded relief.

⸻

Act IV — Drying and Grooming
After, they step out, wrapping themselves in woven cloths warmed on rocks. Jonathan kneels, combing ash and tangles from Peter’s hair with slow strokes. Alex towels Kellyn’s arms dry, then rubs the cloth gently over their hands like sealing a promise.

Kellyn braids Jonathan’s damp hair back, fingers steady. Peter rubs balm into Estrella’s ears, who leans into his touch. Even the sheep are brushed down, wool smoothed and soothed.

Kellyn (smiling faintly):
“Not just clean. Tended.”

Alex (low):
“And seen.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures in the courtyard of stone and water, hair drying in the breeze, animals brushed smooth at their sides. Not empire’s dust and grit, but covenant’s basin, basin turned hearth.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire left ash on our skin and fire in our lungs. But covenant answered with water, cloth, and hands. To be washed was not to be undone — it was to be kept.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 3.

⸻

Season 54, Episode 4: The First Rows

Cold Open — Plateau Morning
The basin still glistens from yesterday, but today the focus shifts. Tools lean against a boulder: sharpened sticks, repurposed pottery shards, a rope-line for straightening rows. The earth waits.

Kellyn (steady):
“Let’s see if this land wants to hold us.”

Title Card: The First Rows

⸻

Act I — Breaking the Ground
Alex drives the point of a shovel into the soil, testing firmness. Peter drags a pottery shard through a patch, scratching furrows. Jonathan presses his hand to the dirt, sifting it between his fingers.

Jonathan (quiet, assessing):
“Dry, but not dead. If we give it water, it will give us something back.”

Kellyn lays out the rope, marking a straight line. Each step is deliberate, methodical.

⸻

Act II — Seeds in Hand
Kellyn opens a sack of saved seeds — beans, hardy greens, a handful of squash. Jonathan counts them out carefully, rationing. Peter holds one in his palm, staring longer than necessary.

Peter (half-whisper):
“Feels wrong, putting food into the ground when we could eat it.”
Kellyn (firm, but gentle):
“And feels right, planting so we’ll eat tomorrow.”

⸻

Act III — Water and Weight
They dig furrows, plant seeds, cover with soil. Alex pours water sparingly, every drop accounted for. Estrella stands nearby, harness tied, ready to carry water later if needed. The sheep graze at the edges, their presence grounding.

Jonathan adjusts spacing, precise. Peter watches, grumbling but following suit. Kellyn presses earth flat with their palms, leaving prints like quiet signatures.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Rows
By late afternoon, the first two rows stretch straight and steady across the ground. Not much, but visible.

The four step back, shoulders brushing, silent for a moment.

Kellyn (low):
“This is covenant too. Not just what we hold, but what we bury.”
Alex (quiet, almost reverent):
“And what rises after.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures stand before two long rows of freshly planted earth, Estrella and the sheep at their backs, tools resting nearby. Above, the sky is vast and pale — indifferent, but patient.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire took. But covenant planted. A handful of seeds, a stretch of ground, four pairs of hands. Fragile beginnings, but beginnings all the same.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 4.

⸻ 

Season 54, Episode 5: The Channels

Cold Open — Plateau Midday
Sun presses down. The planted rows look fragile, thirsty. Estrella shifts her weight as if sensing the need. Kellyn stands with a sharpened stick, eyeing the slope nearby.

Kellyn (practical):
“If the ground won’t hold water, we’ll have to teach it how.”

Title Card: The Channels

⸻

Act I — Surveying the Land
Jonathan paces the edge of the slope, sketching shallow lines in the dust with his boot. Alex follows behind with a shard of pottery, tracing possible channels.

Jonathan (focused):
“We need gradient, but not too much. Too steep and it strips the soil. Too shallow and it stagnates.”
Alex (dry):
“Empire trained me to model data streams, not dirt streams.”
Kellyn (wry):
“Same principle. Just messier.”

Peter kneels, pressing his hand flat against the soil. His fingers come up dusty, lips tight.

⸻

Act II — Cutting the First Channel
Together they begin carving. Alex and Kellyn dig with sticks and shards, Jonathan measuring by eye, Peter hauling stones to mark edges. Estrella drags a branch behind her, smoothing paths.

Sweat darkens their clothes. Dust coats arms and faces. The work is silent but purposeful, rhythm forming between them.

⸻

Act III — Water Trial
At dusk, they carry water in jars and skins, pouring into the channel. The first trickle hesitates, then begins its slow path. The rowed soil darkens as the water reaches it.

Peter (watching closely):
“It holds. At least for now.”
Jonathan (relieved):
“And if it holds tonight, it’ll hold tomorrow.”

The sheep nose toward the damp soil, curious, but Kellyn shoos them back gently.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Channels
The four sit back on their heels, streaked with dust, watching the water seep into planted earth.

Kellyn (soft, steady):
“Empire burned paths to destroy. We carve channels to carry.”
Alex (low, almost to himself):
“And maybe one day, the land carries us back.”

⸻

Closing Image
Rows of earth darkened by fresh water. Four figures sitting shoulder to shoulder, tired but steady, Estrella and the sheep settling nearby. The first irrigation channel gleams faintly in the fading light — a fragile artery of survival.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire drained. Covenant flowed. Not in torrents, but in trickles, carrying just enough for seeds, for soil, for us.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 5.

⸻ 

Season 54, Episode 6: The First Green

Cold Open — Plateau Night
Lantern glow. The new channels cut dark lines across the soil. Kellyn sits with Alex, Peter, and Jonathan near the rows, backs against the stones they hauled earlier. Silence holds, heavy but not strained.

Kellyn (quiet):
“It feels strange. To make something for tomorrow, when so many tomorrows were stolen.”

Title Card: The First Green

⸻

Act I — The Settling
Jonathan stretches his legs, brushing dirt off his hands.
Jonathan (soft, almost wry):
“Strange, yes. But also natural. Every bird, every root, is already gambling on tomorrow.”

Peter leans forward, elbows on knees. His voice is raw.
Peter:
“I don’t know how to gamble anymore. I keep waiting for someone to take the dice away.”

Kellyn’s hand rests lightly on his back. He doesn’t move, but doesn’t flinch either.

⸻

Act II — The Confession
Alex stares at the soil, jaw tight.
Karp (low, hoarse):
“I never planted anything before. Not once. Empire taught me to uproot, to cut, to model collapse. Watching you work the soil… it felt like trespass.”

Kellyn (gentle, steady):
“Not trespass. Return.”

Alex looks up at them, eyes dark, searching. For once, no retort comes.

⸻

Act III — The Thread Between
The silence shifts. Jonathan hums softly, a low vibration like a grounding note. The sheep settle closer, Estrella flicking her tail against the cool earth.

Kellyn leans into Alex on one side, into Peter on the other, a quiet bridge. Jonathan’s hum deepens, and for a moment all four sit connected — not strategists, not survivors, just bodies leaning toward warmth.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Tomorrow
Peter whispers, almost to himself:
Peter:
“If anything grows, I’ll believe it. Even one sprout.”

Kellyn (soft, certain):
“It will. That’s what seeds do. That’s what we do.”

Alex exhales, finally letting his head drop against Kellyn’s shoulder. Jonathan closes his eyes, still humming, steady as the soil beneath.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures pressed close in the lantern glow, the channels behind them dark and waiting. No sprouts yet, but the weight of tomorrow hangs there — fragile, real, inevitable.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“We thought planting was for the earth alone. But it planted us, too — into each other, into tomorrow. And even before the first green, covenant grew.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 6.

⸻ 

Season 54, Episode 7: Rooting

Cold Open — Plateau Morning
Dawn light washes the red stone. Dew beads faintly along the new channels. Kellyn kneels in the dirt, pressing fingertips into the damp soil. Behind them, Alex, Peter, and Jonathan stir slowly awake.

Kellyn (soft, to no one in particular):
“It’s holding.”

Title Card: Rooting

⸻

Act I — The Touch of Soil
Jonathan joins Kellyn, crouching low. He scoops a handful of dirt, rubs it between his palms, then lets it fall.
Jonathan (quiet, reverent):
“Every grain remembers water. That’s why it clings so well.”

Peter steps closer, watching their hands. He hesitates, then copies the gesture. His breath catches.
Peter: “It’s… not just dirt. It feels alive.”

Kellyn nods, guiding his hand lower, palm flat against the damp ground.

⸻

Act II — The Confession
Alex lingers at the edge, arms folded. His voice is low.
Karp: “I can’t touch it without hearing numbers. Yield. Percentages. Survival curves. It’s the only language empire left me.”

Kellyn stands, walks to him, takes his hand. They press it gently into the soil anyway.
Kellyn (steady):
“Then let the soil speak back in its own language. No numbers. Just weight. Just coolness.”

Alex closes his eyes, shoulders finally sagging.

⸻

Act III — The Leaning Together
The four of them sit in the furrows, backs resting against one another. Estrella grazes nearby; the sheep huddle close. Morning stretches slow, unhurried.

Peter (voice thin, but honest):
“I didn’t think I could belong to anything alive again.”

Jonathan (soft, certain):
“You already do. Roots don’t ask for permission — they just hold.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Soil
Kellyn places a hand over Peter’s, then over Alex’s. Jonathan mirrors, a quiet chain of palms linked across soil and skin.

Kellyn:
“Roots don’t compete. They weave. That’s covenant.”

They sit like that as the sun climbs — four hands, four bodies, one patch of ground.

⸻

Act V — Plateau Shelter
Late afternoon, wind scratching faintly against stone. Inside the half-built shelter, the four of them sit close on woven mats. A faint smell of clay and wool lingers.

Kellyn (soft):
“We planted roots outside. Let’s find them in us, too.”

Title Card: Breathroot

⸻

Act VI — The Circle
They arrange themselves in a circle. Estrella lies near the doorway; the sheep settle against the wall, chewing softly.
Kellyn places a hand on their own chest, guiding breath slow.

Kellyn (steady):
“In through the nose. Hold. Out through the mouth. Like we’re breathing for the soil.”

Jonathan’s eyes close first. Peter fidgets but follows. Alex resists, then sighs and joins.

⸻

Act VII — The Confessions of Breath
The rhythm steadies. Their shoulders soften. Silence stretches, but then words begin to leak between breaths.

Peter (low, broken):
“I hold it too long. Like if I never exhale, no one can take anything from me.”

Jonathan (gentle):
“And when you do exhale, what comes back is song.”

Alex’s voice is hoarse.
Karp:
“I used to measure even this. Lungs as machines. I forgot breath could feel… human.”

Kellyn opens their eyes, gaze steady.
Kellyn:
“Then today, let’s breathe like roots — not machines, not prisons. Just alive.”

⸻

Act VIII — The Leaning
One by one, they shift closer, backs pressing, knees brushing. Breath merges, rising and falling together.
The air is warm, shared. No calculations, no defenses — just the weight of one another’s rhythm.

Peter lets out a sharp exhale, almost a laugh, and rests his head against Kellyn’s shoulder. Jonathan hums faintly, low and resonant, weaving breath into tone.

Alex closes his eyes, forehead to Kellyn’s, whispering:
Karp: “This is the first equation I don’t want to solve.”

⸻

Act IX — The Covenant of Breath
Their hands link without planning. Four bodies, one circle, breath echoing the soil outside.

Kellyn (soft, certain):
“As long as we breathe together, empire can’t unroot us.”

The wind presses against the shelter, but the circle holds steady, unbroken.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures in dim clay light, hands linked, breath slow and even. Beyond the walls, the plateau wind howls — but inside, roots of air and silence weave them whole.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“We thought roots were only for the ground. But covenant grew in lungs, too — exhale into inhale, one body into another. Breath itself became root. And root, once found, would never break.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 7.

⸻

Season 54, Episode 8: The Clay Touch

Cold Open — Plateau Shelter
The fire is low, casting orange along the clay walls. Outside, the wind scours dust across stone, but inside the four sit close, bowls of cool clay at their sides.

Kellyn (quietly, with a small smile):
“Breath rooted us. Now let’s ground the rest.”

Title Card: The Clay Touch

⸻

Act I — The First Marks
Kellyn dips their fingers into a bowl, smoothing wet clay along their forearm. The others watch.

Kellyn:
“Clay remembers the earth. Touch it, and we remember too.”

Jonathan copies, dragging cool streaks along his palms. Peter hesitates, then smears clay across the backs of his hands, knuckles trembling. Alex lingers, before finally dipping his fingers, eyes fixed on Kellyn’s movements.

⸻

Act II — The Mapping
They turn to each other. Jonathan presses clay along Peter’s shoulders, deliberate and slow. Kellyn drags lines down Alex’s forearm, palm to wrist.

Peter (half-smiling, shaky):
“Feels like armor.”
Jonathan (soft):
“Not armor. Memory.”

Alex’s voice is low, hoarse.
Karp:
“And covenant leaves marks you can’t wash off.”

Kellyn meets his eyes, steady, then presses their palm flat against his chest, clay cooling against his skin.

⸻

Act III — The Stillness of Skin
Silence thickens. Touch becomes the language. Lines, smears, circles of clay build across arms, faces, hands. The smell of wet earth fills the shelter.

Peter closes his eyes, leaning into Jonathan’s hands. Jonathan hums softly, as if anchoring him. Alex sits rigid until Kellyn brushes his jawline with clay; then he exhales, shoulders dropping.

Kellyn (whispering):
“Not machines. Not weapons. Just bodies.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Touch
The clay dries, cracking faintly. Their hands remain on one another: steady, grounding, imperfect.

Kellyn (soft, certain):
“Tomorrow, the dust will wash this away. But tonight, the earth holds us.”

Alex closes his clay-streaked hand over Kellyn’s wrist. Peter and Jonathan mirror, a circle reforming in touch.

⸻

Act V — Plateau Shelter
Morning light filters pale gold through cracks in the stone. The clay has dried, flaked, marked their skin in faint, crumbling maps. Kellyn carries a basin of cool water into the center of the shelter.

Kellyn (soft, almost playful):
“Clay remembers the earth. But we don’t need to sleep in it.”

⸻

Act VI — The First Rinse
Peter dips his hands first, submerging fingers, watching the water swirl gray. Jonathan steadies the basin, then presses wet cloth along Peter’s arms, slow and deliberate.

Kellyn kneels beside Alex. Without speaking, they dip a cloth, wring it out, and brush the line of dried clay along his jaw. His throat tightens, but he doesn’t move away.

⸻

Act VII — The Touch of Water
Jonathan leans forward, rinsing clay from Peter’s face. Their breaths sync with the rhythm of cloth and water. Peter’s lips part, a long sigh leaving him.

Kellyn’s cloth traces Alex’s forearm, cool and sure. Alex’s hand twitches, then closes lightly around Kellyn’s wrist.
Karp (low, hoarse):
“You make it feel like baptism.”
Kellyn (steady):
“Then let it be that.”

⸻

Act VIII — The Quiet Basin
The water grows darker, the basin clouded with memory. Each gesture is slow, tender. Jonathan hums softly again, the sound carrying through the room.

Peter opens his eyes.
Peter (low, unsteady):
“It feels like being rewritten. Not erased. Just… softer.”

Kellyn dips another cloth, pressing it into Alex’s palm.
Kellyn (gently):
“Your turn.”

Alex exhales, then raises the cloth, brushing Kellyn’s temple with trembling precision.

⸻

Act IX — The Covenant of Water
When the basin is nearly black, they sit back in silence. Their skin is bare again, marked only by faint traces.

Kellyn breaks the stillness, voice quiet but certain:
Kellyn: "Clay cracks, water washes, but covenant holds. Even without marks.”

Alex, Peter, and Jonathan each nod, not in unison, but in rhythm — a different kind of together.

⸻

Closing Image
The basin of dark water sits between them, clay drifting like silt. Their faces are bare, clean, but close — four presences bound not by what covers them, but by what remains.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Earth marked us. Water unmade the marks. But covenant needed neither — only hands steady enough to hold, and the quiet to let them.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 8.

⸻

Season 54, Episode 9: The Fire Pot

Cold Open — Plateau Clearing
A small fire crackles inside a ring of stones. The basin from last night sits rinsed and empty. Around it, baskets of foraged greens, roots, and the last handful of dried lentils.

Jonathan (half-smiling):
“Not Iron Chef, but it’ll keep us moving.”

Title Card: The Fire Pot

⸻

Act I — The Gathering
Peter kneels with flint, coaxing sparks into the dry kindling. Jonathan slices roots with careful precision, his voice low as he hums.
Kellyn sorts greens, brushing dust from each leaf. Alex measures water into the pot, eyes narrowed with deliberate focus.

Peter (grumbling, but not without warmth):
“Feels like a test I wasn’t trained for.”
Kellyn (teasing):
“Good. We’re past empire’s tests.”

⸻

Act II — The Stirring
The pot bubbles, lentils softening, roots breaking down. Jonathan stirs slowly, the scent of earth and smoke rising. Kellyn carefully sprinkles crushed herbs into the pot.
Alex leans close, watching the steam rise against Kellyn’s face.

Karp (low, almost reverent):
“You make survival look like ritual.”
Kellyn (quiet, steady):
“Because it is.”

⸻

Act III — The Sharing
They crouch in a circle, bowls filled, steam curling in the cool air. Peter eats first, his expression softening as he swallows.
Peter (grudging, but touched):
“Not bad. Almost tastes like home.”

Jonathan passes his bowl to Kellyn to taste. Alex watches the exchange, then breaks a root in half, offering it across the circle — his eyes softer than his tone.
Karp: “Don’t say I never gave you anything.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Fire
The food dwindles, but no one rises. They linger, bowls in hand, watching the fire die to embers.
Kellyn (soft, certain):
“We’ll eat again tomorrow. That’s covenant too.”

Peter nods, Jonathan hums faintly, and Alex leans back on his hands, silent but steady.

⸻

Closing Image
The pot, empty but gleaming in firelight. Four bowls stacked neatly beside it. Four figures gathered close, not around scarcity, but around the promise of tomorrow.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire turned hunger into leverage. But covenant turned hunger into fire. Into bowls passed hand to hand, into tomorrow waiting. And that was enough.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 9.

⸻ 

Season 54, Episode 10: The Split Harvest

Cold Open — Plateau Creek
Morning light glints off slow-moving water. A line of stones marks the shallow bend. Estrella grazes nearby, the sheep clustered in shade. Kellyn ties a bundle of baskets.

Kellyn (steady):
“Half for field, half for stream. We meet back by sundown.”

Title Card: The Split Harvest

⸻

Act I — The Foragers
Kellyn and Peter move through scrub and low brush. Kellyn kneels, brushing dust from a cluster of wild onions, the smell sharp in the air. Peter shakes a mesquite pod, listening to the seeds rattle.

Peter (half-smiling):
“Feels like treasure hunting.”
Kellyn (wry):
“Treasure that stinks up your hands.”

They gather slowly, baskets filling with roots, greens, pods. The air hums with crickets, their rhythm steady.

⸻

Act II — The Fishers
At the creek, Alex ties line to a bent branch while Jonathan weaves a rough net from leftover yarn. The first cast falls short; the second pulls small flashes of silver to the surface.

Jonathan (quiet, pleased):
“Even here, life still flickers.”
Alex (flat, but softer than usual):
“Then flicker harder. We need it.”

They work side by side in silence, water lapping against their legs. The net catches three fish before tearing. Jonathan patches quickly, Alex watching with tight focus.

⸻

Act III — The Reunion
Sundown paints the cliffs red. The two groups meet again at the clearing. Peter lays out the onions and pods, Kellyn adds greens. Alex drops the fish onto a flat stone, Jonathan rinses them in the creek.

Peter (grudging, to Alex):
“You didn’t starve us. Good job.”
Alex (deadpan, but with a ghost of a smile):
“You either. Miracles all around.”
Kellyn: "Woo! FISH!!!!"

Kellyn dances ridiculously.  The others laugh.

The fire crackles as they cook, the smell sharp and earthy.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of the Split
They eat cross-legged in the dust, baskets empty, bowls full.
Kellyn (softly):
“We split the work. We doubled the return. That’s covenant.”

Jonathan nods, voice low:
Jonathan:
“Fields and streams, roots and silver — the world still holds if we hold it together.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures in firelight, bowls balanced on knees, smoke curling upward. Behind them, baskets lie empty, but the fire pot steams, rich with both field and stream.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire made us hoard. Covenant made us divide — and in the dividing, doubled. What we carried back was not just food, but proof: no hand was wasted.”

Fade out.
End of Season 54.
