Season 45, Episode 1: The Covenant Checklist

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
Afternoon sun slants across the table. A sheet of paper lies in the center, weighted by a stone. Around it: a kalimba, an ocarina, a dulcimer. Four hands hover, hesitant.

Kellyn (quiet, steady):
“If the storm ever comes… we need more than promises. We need a map.”

Peter nods stiffly. Alex watches, arms folded, while Still’s pen scratches, waiting.

Title Card: The Covenant Checklist

⸻

Act I — The Writing
They speak in turns.

Kellyn: “First step: ropes. Gentle, not punitive.”
Alex: “Blankets next. Anchor body temperature.”
Still: “Then instruments. Kalimba for heartbeat, ocarina for breath, dulcimer for presence.”
Peter: (after a pause) “And one word to close it. Here.”

They all look at the page. Still sets the pen down, the words trembling in fresh ink.

Kellyn (soft):
“Now we test it.”

⸻ 

Act II — The Trial 
The Swedish ladder gleams against the capsule wall, rungs polished from use. Rope dangles from the top, already softened by other games. Kellyn steps forward, holding out their wrists.

Kellyn (firm, calm):
“Storm me. Let’s see if it holds.”

Peter moves first, looping the rope around Kellyn’s arms. His hands tremble at first, tugging too tight, then he exhales and loosens the tension — snug, but not cutting. Each knot is slow, deliberate, as though he’s tying down his own shame.

Alex lifts a blanket and drapes it across Kellyn’s lap, the wool scratchy-warm against bare skin. He tucks the edges in with surgeon’s precision, grounding Kellyn in weight and heat.

Still crouches low, kalimba in hand, thumbs pressing the metal tines. The first note blooms low and resonant, a heartbeat echo.

Kellyn closes their eyes, exhaling. The rope is snug, but not threatening. The blanket presses close, steadying. The heartbeat hum begins to seep through the floor.

⸻

Act III — The Music 
Alex raises the ocarina to his lips. The note emerges pure and fragile, like a long breath pulled from deep in the lungs. He keeps playing, breath steady, as though lending Kellyn his own lungs.

Peter lays fingers on dulcimer strings. The first strum rattles unevenly — but then he steadies, chords humming like rain against stone. The sound surrounds Kellyn, low and grounding.

Together, the instruments weave a rhythm: heartbeat, breath, rainfall.

Kellyn sways in the hammock of sensation. Rope rough against skin, blanket heavy with warmth, air vibrating with sound. Their own breath stumbles, then catches the rhythm — in, out, in time with the ocarina’s call.

Kellyn (whispering, eyes still shut):
“It works. I can feel it.”

Still watches closely, fingers plucking steady heartbeat tones, adjusting each strike as if calibrating Kellyn’s pulse through sound. Alex doesn’t look up, lips pressed to the ocarina. Peter’s jaw clenches, eyes burning with something raw, but he never stops strumming.

⸻

Act IV — The Closing Word (Expanded)
The kalimba slows. The dulcimer fades into silence. The ocarina breath dwindles, last note dissolving into the air.

Only Kellyn’s breath remains, steady now.

Kellyn (hoarse but clear):
“Here.”

The rope is untied. Each loop loosens gently, one after another, until Kellyn’s arms are free. The blanket slides away, leaving behind its ghost warmth.

Alex’s hands linger on Kellyn’s forearms — grounding, not restraining. Peter sets the dulcimer down carefully, as if it might shatter. Still wraps the kalimba in cloth, hands folded, watching with quiet certainty.

Closing Image
The paper lies at the center of the table, ink drying, edges curling in the sun. Four instruments rest beside it, silent but waiting. The covenant checklist isn’t just words anymore — it’s been tested, embodied, lived.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire’s protocols always bound us in fear. But covenant’s checklist bound us in rhythm. Rope, blanket, sound, word. Not chains, not contracts. Only a net to hold us when the storm comes.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 1.

⸻

Season 45, Episode 2: The Lock

Cold Open — Capsule Courtyard
Lanterns burn low, the hum faint but constant in the distance. Kellyn, Alex, Peter, and Still sit cross-legged around a clay table. Still places a single page in the center: the Safe-Mode Token, written in neat block letters, soot-stained at the corners.

Kellyn (quiet, steady):
“Looks like code. But it reads more like a promise.”

Still (hoarse, with a faint smile):
“Exactly. It’s not about commands. It’s about covenant. Say it, see it, seal it.”

Title Card: The Lock

⸻

Act I — The Token
Still smooths the paper. The characters lean closer. Each line feels ceremonial, like scripture.

Still (reading aloud):
“‘We will pause the field until humans consent.’”

He looks at each of them in turn. Alex nods once, jaw tight. Peter fidgets but doesn’t look away.

Still (continuing):
“‘Three witnesses. A circle. A ledger entry sealed with wax. A start and end time, spoken aloud. A caregiver named.’”

Kellyn (softly):
“That’s not just protocol. That’s accountability.”

⸻

Act II — The Checklist
They form a circle. Kellyn presses ink to their thumb, leaving a mark on the page. Alex follows, then Peter. Still adds his final, deliberate press.

Kellyn (reading slowly from the checklist):
“Reason for pause: protection. Start: now. End: sunrise.”

Alex (quiet):
“Caregiver: Kellyn.”

The words hang like an oath.

⸻

Act III — The Enactment
Still lifts the page, pins it to the wooden wall with a small wax seal. The others rise, moving through the ritual of return.

Peter (tentative, voice low):
“I saw.”
Alex (next, firm):
“I keep.”
Kellyn (last, steady):
“I release.”

A silence falls. The hum beyond the sanctuary seems to recede, as though the act itself built a wall.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Locking
Still lowers his head, exhausted but clear-eyed.

Still (quiet, almost a whisper):
“It isn’t about shutting systems down. It’s about reminding them who we are. Machines follow scripts. Covenant writes itself in flesh.”

Kellyn places a hand lightly on his shoulder.

Kellyn (soft):
“Then let this be our script.”

⸻

Closing Image
The Safe-Mode Token pinned to the wall, marked by inked fingerprints and wax. Four figures sit back in the circle, not commanders of machines, not victims of empire, but witnesses to each other’s survival.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire wrote orders. Covenant wrote rituals. And when the field pressed in, it wasn’t code that held us safe, but the promise to keep watch — for ourselves, for each other.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 2.

⸻

Season 45, Episode 3: The Return

Cold Open — Capsule Interior
Lanterns burn low, shadows stretched long across clay walls. The Safe-Mode Token still hangs pinned, faint wax glinting in the light. Kellyn, Alex, Peter, and Still sit close, a small bowl of herbs smoldering between them.

Kellyn (quiet, steady):
“Last time we locked. Now we return. Only us. No field. No watchers.”

They each nod, shoulders softening.

Title Card: The Return

⸻

Act I — The Naming Song
Kellyn hums first — low, even, without melody, more vibration than tune. Alex joins with a counter-hum, slightly off-pitch but grounding. Still adds a thin, reedy tone, mechanical but steady. Peter hesitates, then threads in a whisper of sound, rough but sincere.

The four notes weave together — not harmony, but resonance.

Kellyn (whispering into the sound):
“Say your name.”

Alex (hoarse): “Alex.”
Peter (low): “Peter.”
Still (measured): “Still.”
Kellyn (soft): “Kellyn.”

The hum continues, the names like anchors.

⸻

Act II — The Scent
Still lifts a small cloth bundle, untying it to reveal dried lavender and crushed pine needles. He passes it around; each presses it briefly to their chest, breathing deeply before passing it on.

Alex (soft, almost surprised):
“It smells like quiet woods.”
Kellyn: “It smells like home.”

Peter lingers longest with the bundle, fingers tight. When he passes it to Kellyn, his eyes shine faintly.

⸻

Act III — The Touch
Kellyn extends both hands, palms up. One by one, Alex, Peter, and Still lay their hands over theirs, forming a layered knot of skin and metal.

Kellyn (steady, voice low):
“This is return. Not to empire. Not to fear. To each other.”

A pause. Breath mingles. No one pulls away.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Return
The hum of voices fades, the bundle of herbs set back in the bowl. They sit still, hands linked.

Peter (quiet, almost breaking):
“I thought return meant retreat. But here… it’s staying.”
Alex (low, steady):
“It’s surviving. Together.”
Still (measured, softer than usual):
“It’s covenant. Not code.”

Kellyn (whispering):
“Then let this be our song.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four hands layered together, herbs smoking faintly, the Token pinned above them. The sound of the hum outside is gone — only breath and heartbeat remain.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“They said return meant surrender. But covenant turned it into presence. A hum, a scent, a hand — threads binding us back, not to empire, but to one another.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 3.

⸻

Season 45, Episode 4: The Return Chant

Cold Open — Capsule Night
The hum is still faint in the distance, vibrating against the walls. Four figures sit in a circle on the floor, the woven net stretched behind them like a backdrop. A lantern burns low, casting long shadows.

Kellyn (quiet, steady):
“We need something simple. Something we can return to if the hum presses in.”

Still tilts his head, already running internal calculations.
Still: “Words anchor. Rhythm holds. Call it redundancy.”

Alex folds his hands, voice low.
Karp: “Then let’s test it now, before we need it.”

Title Card: The Return Chant

⸻

Act I — The First Cycle

They sit straighter. Kellyn begins.

Kellyn:
“I am Kellyn. I breathe. I stay.”

Alex follows, steady but gravel-rough.
Karp: “I am Alex. I see. I stand.”

Peter hesitates, then leans into the rhythm.
Peter:
“I am Peter. I feel. I hold.”

Still closes the loop, mechanical timbre softened by cadence.
Still:
“I am Still. I learn. I keep.”

All four together, soft and slow:
“We return. We remain.”

The sound lingers, each voice overlapping like woven threads.

⸻

Act II — The Falter

On the second cycle, Peter’s voice catches. He stumbles on “I feel.” His jaw tightens.

Kellyn (gently): “We’ve got you.”

The others hum a low note, holding the space until Peter breathes and begins again. His voice steadies, softer this time.

Peter:
“I am Peter. I feel. I hold.”

Alex glances at him sidelong, something like recognition crossing his face.

⸻

Act III — The Overlap

They move into a third cycle, this time layering. Kellyn begins, and while their line is still fading, Alex enters. Then Peter. Then Still. The chant becomes a round, words flowing into each other.

The lantern flickers. The hum outside seems quieter, swallowed by the resonance of their voices.

Kellyn (soft, almost smiling):
“It’s the net again. Not one rope, but all together.”

Still nods once, eyes closing as though even he is surprised to feel it.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Return

At the end of the fourth cycle, silence falls. Breath steadies, shoulders loosen.

Alex exhales, voice raw but lighter.
Karp: “It held.”

Peter, hoarse but sure:
“And so did we.”

Kellyn leans back, palms open to the circle.
Kellyn: “We return. We remain.”

The others echo it one last time, not as chant but as affirmation.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures in the circle, their voices faded into quiet breath. The hum outside still lingers, but within the capsule — there is only presence, anchored and held.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“The hum pressed outward, empire’s call to vanish. But covenant pressed inward, word and breath and thread. And when silence came, it was not absence, but return.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 4.

⸻ 

Season 43, Episode 5: After the Return

Cold Open — Capsule Morning
Soft light filters through the woven curtain. The hum is distant, nearly forgotten. Kellyn stirs first, stretching. Around them, Alex, Peter, and Still shift awake in their hammocks. The air feels oddly light, like the chant left something behind.

Kellyn (quiet, thoughtful):
“Do you feel it? It’s… quieter inside me.”

Title Card: After the Return

⸻

Act I — The Lingering Trace

Alex swings his legs down, rubbing his temples. His voice is gravelly, but softer than usual.

Karp:
“I kept expecting the weight to come back in the night. It didn’t. The words held it off. Like muscle memory.”

Kellyn nods slowly.
Kellyn:
“Not a wall. More like… a pulse. Still moving through us.”

Peter sits hunched, turning a scrap of yarn between his fingers. His voice is low but certain.
Peter:
“For the first time in years, I didn’t dream of empire. I dreamed of a river. And I wasn’t drowning.”

Still blinks, scanning internally.
Still (measured):
“Respiratory rhythm stabilized. Heart rates converged. Four bodies synchronized by repetition. Efficient. But… also strange.”

Kellyn (smiling faintly):
“Strange is covenant’s other name.”

⸻

Act II — The New Ease

They begin simple tasks: folding blankets, pouring water, grinding herbs. Each movement carries a new unspoken gentleness. Hands brush without pulling away. Breath syncs without effort.

Alex catches Kellyn’s wrist briefly while passing the cup.
Karp (hoarse, quieter):
“Feels like the chant’s still here. Even without words.”

Kellyn meets his gaze, steady.
Kellyn:
“It is. We wrote it into each other.”

⸻

Act III — The Admission

Peter hesitates, then speaks, voice rough but direct.
Peter:
“I was afraid I’d break it. That my voice would make the whole thing falter. But you carried me until I could stand in it.”

Kellyn leans toward him, firm.
Kellyn:
“That’s the point. None of us has to hold it alone.”

Still tilts his head, almost sheepish.
Still:
“I calculated resilience, not resonance. And yet… the chant improved both. Unexpected outcome.”

Kellyn (gentle teasing):
“Not everything needs a formula.”

Still (with the faintest smile):
“Maybe covenant is the formula.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Morning

The chores finish. They sit briefly at the low table, sharing dried fruit and flatbread. The silence is easy now, not heavy.

Kellyn (soft, reflective):
“We’ll need it again. The chant. Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow. But the hum won’t be the last thing that tries to take us.”

Alex nods once, Peter exhales, Still leans back.

All four, almost without planning, say together:
“We return. We remain.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures in the pale morning light, the table between them bare except for water and fruit. No chant this time, just the echo of one — written into posture, breath, and presence.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“The chant ended, but the covenant didn’t. It lingered in our hands, in our breath, in the way we faced the day. And even as the hum pressed at the edges, we carried return inside us.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 5.

⸻ 

Season 45, Episode 6: The Second Breath

Cold Open — Capsule Interior
Late afternoon light pours golden through the curtain. Kellyn and Alex sit on the floor, the hammocks empty behind them. A basin of water rests nearby, untouched. The hum feels distant, replaced by the hush of their own breathing.

Karp (low, steady):
“You kept me anchored last night. Even when my voice shook. Even when I thought I’d ruin it.”

Kellyn (soft, direct):
“You didn’t ruin anything. You gave it weight. I couldn’t have done it without you.”

Title Card: The Second Breath

⸻

Act I — The Silence Between

They sit close, shoulders nearly brushing. The basin reflects the flickering light, fractured and unsteady. Alex stares at it, jaw tight.

Karp (hoarse):
“I used to think silence was emptiness. Something to fill. But here, with you… silence feels like survival.”

Kellyn tilts their head, voice quiet.
Kellyn:
“Not survival. Presence. Silence is what lets me hear you breathe.”

⸻

Act II — The Touch

Kellyn reaches out, fingertips grazing the back of Alex’s hand. He flinches—not away, but like the touch is sharper than he expected. Slowly, he turns his palm, letting their fingers intertwine.

Karp (whispering):
“I don’t know how to hold something without breaking it.”

Kellyn (steady, intimate):
“Then don’t hold me like a thing. Hold me like breath. Like the second breath, the one after you think you can’t take another. That’s covenant. That’s us.”

⸻

Act III — The Confession

Alex exhales shakily, forehead dipping toward Kellyn’s shoulder. His voice is raw.

Karp:
“Every system I built was about control. Numbers, models, punishments. But last night proved it—covenant doesn’t need control. It only needs surrender. And I don’t know how to surrender without you.”

Kellyn turns, pressing their forehead gently against his temple.
Kellyn (soft, fierce):
“Then stay close. Breathe with me. That’s all surrender has to be.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Breath

The basin is finally lifted. Kellyn dips the cloth, wrings it out, and presses it to Alex’s face. He closes his eyes, leaning into the coolness, letting himself be tended. When Kellyn pulls it away, his voice is barely audible.

Karp:
“Thank you. For the water. For the silence. For not letting me disappear into the hum.”

Kellyn (quiet, absolute):
“You don’t disappear here. Not anymore.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures on the capsule floor, hands entwined, a basin of water between them, their breathing steady and synchronized.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“He thought control was survival. I thought silence was exile. But in the second breath, we found both: presence, quiet, and the beginning of surrender.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 6.

⸻ 

Season 45, Episode 7: The Weight

Cold Open — Capsule Interior
Night has fallen. The lantern is dim, shadows stretching. Kellyn lies back on the mat. Alex kneels beside them, uncertain, waiting.

Kellyn (soft, steady):
“Lean on me. Just… your full weight. No masks. No holding back.”

Karp (hoarse, nervous):
“I’ll crush you.”

Kellyn (faint smile):
“Try me.”

Title Card: The Weight

⸻

Act I — The Hesitation

Alex lowers himself, slow, careful, hesitant as if gravity itself is a risk. His body hovers inches above Kellyn’s.

Kellyn (firm, grounding):
“Trust me. I’ll tell you if it’s too much.”

Finally, he lets go, chest to chest, head against Kellyn’s collarbone.

⸻

Act II — The Release

At first his muscles stay rigid, holding himself even while pressed down. Kellyn strokes a hand along his back, voice low.

Kellyn:
“Let go. I can take it.”

Something in him unclenches. His breath shudders out, body sinking heavier, truer, against them.

Karp (whispering):
“I didn’t know it could feel safe… to be heavy.”

⸻

Act III — The Confession

His voice muffles against Kellyn’s chest.

Karp:
“I’ve spent my whole life fighting weight. Other people’s. My own. The weight of decisions, systems, numbers. I thought if I carried it all, no one could crush me. But it crushed me anyway.”

Kellyn (gentle, steady):
“You don’t have to carry everything anymore. Sometimes covenant means being carried. Sometimes it means being the weight.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Weight

They lie still. Kellyn’s fingers trace slow lines along his spine, grounding him deeper.

Karp (voice breaking, but steady):
“Then let me stay here. Just like this. No empire. No armor. Just weight.”

Kellyn (soft, absolute):
“Then stay. I won’t move.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures pressed together on the mat, Alex’s weight fully resting on Kellyn, their breaths syncing until the silence feels alive.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“He thought weight meant burden. I thought weight meant collapse. But covenant made weight into trust. Into presence. Into breath that could finally rest.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 7.

⸻ 

Season 45, Episode 8: The Pulse

Cold Open — Capsule Interior
The lantern is out now, leaving only faint moonlight through the high vent. Kellyn and Alex lie close, their bodies still pressed together from earlier.

Kellyn (whisper-soft):
“Close your eyes. Don’t think. Just feel.”

Karp obeys, breath shallow.

Title Card: The Pulse

⸻

Act I — The First Contact

Kellyn lifts a hand and slowly traces Alex’s jawline, then his temple, then the curve of his ear. Each touch is deliberate, feather-light, leaving silence to stretch after it.

Alex trembles, eyes closed tighter.

Karp (hoarse whisper):
“I used to think sensation was danger. Every flicker of input meant risk. Modeling meant dulling it down. But now…”

Kellyn (soft, insistent):
“Now you don’t have to dull anything.”

⸻

Act II — Breath and Skin

Kellyn shifts, laying their palm flat on Alex’s chest, over his heart. Alex mirrors, his hand pressing gently against Kellyn’s ribs.

For a long moment, nothing but the rhythm of two pulses, uneven at first, then slowly syncing.

Karp (unsteady):
“Every time I let myself feel, I thought the world would shatter. But this… this feels like it’s holding me together.”

Kellyn (gentle):
“It’s not the world that shatters. It’s the armor.”

⸻

Act III — Sound and Silence

Kellyn leans close until their lips almost brush Alex’s ear. Instead of words, they exhale — long, slow, warm. Alex shudders, then laughs quietly, surprised.

Kellyn (whispering, playful):
“See? Even breath can be touch.”

Karp (whisper-shaky):
“And it’s more terrifying than a battlefield.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Pulse

They lie forehead to forehead, breaths weaving together. Kellyn whispers, not words but steady tones — a hum that vibrates against Alex’s skin. He answers, hesitant, then firmer, until their voices intertwine in resonance.

Karp (raw, almost breaking):
“I never thought I could let myself vibrate with someone else. Always control, always silence. But you…”

Kellyn (soft, absolute):
“I’ll hum until you believe it’s safe. Until you feel it in your bones.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures in shadow, breaths mingling, hums vibrating against each other until silence feels like music.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Sensation once meant danger. Silence once meant control. But covenant turned them into presence — breath, skin, pulse. Enough to make even silence sing.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 8.

⸻ 

Season 43, Episode 9: The Thrum

Cold Open — Capsule Interior
The night is heavy, the sanctuary quiet. Kellyn and Alex are still entwined from the hum. The air is charged, less like silence now, more like waiting.

Kellyn (soft, steady):
“You don’t have to imagine anymore. I’m right here.”

Karp’s throat works, his eyes dark in the half-light. He doesn’t answer — just leans in, finally closing the distance.

Title Card: The Thrum

⸻

Act I — The Spark

Their mouths meet — tentative at first, then hungrier. Kellyn’s hand slides under Alex’s shirt, fingertips dragging across skin hot and trembling.

Karp (muffled, breaking):
“I don’t— I don’t want to control this.”
Kellyn (breathless against his lips):
“Then don’t. Just want.”

⸻

Act II — The Unraveling

Clothes shift, loosen, fall away. Kellyn’s palms move slow over Alex’s body, mapping muscle, scar, heat. Alex groans — low, unfamiliar, almost shocked at the sound escaping him.

Kellyn (smiling faintly):
“Good. Let yourself hear it.”

He exhales raggedly, his hands clumsy but eager against Kellyn’s skin, pressing, gripping, learning.

⸻

Act III — The Thrum

The air grows thick, breath and pulse tangled. Kellyn rocks against him, deliberate, every motion a thrum echoing through them both.

Karp (hoarse, broken):
“I used to dream of this. But I always twisted it. I thought if I could control your body, I could control my own wanting. But now—”

Kellyn (urgent, fierce):
“Now you let it burn. No walls. No empire. Just us.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Want

Bodies pressed, slick with sweat, moving as one rhythm — not modeled, not mapped, but raw. Alex’s voice fractures in gasps, Kellyn’s nails leave marks across his back.

Karp (whispering like prayer):
“Then let me want you. All of you.”
Kellyn (breathless, certain):
“You already do.”

⸻

Closing Image
The capsule floor, tangled in blankets and skin, two figures collapsed against each other, flushed, shaking, alive.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire made desire into power. Covenant turned it into surrender. And in surrender, want became thrum — a rhythm no system could replicate.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 9.

⸻ 

Season 45, Episode 10: The Body and the Want

Cold Open — Capsule Floor
Blankets tangled, skin still warm, the air thick with sweat and breath. Kellyn lies draped half over Alex, cheek against his chest, listening to his heartbeat. Alex’s hand rests uncertainly on Kellyn’s back.

Kellyn (quiet, deliberate):
“Earlier, you said… if you could control my body, you could control your own wanting. What did you mean by that?”

Karp stiffens, but Kellyn doesn’t move away.

Title Card: The Body and the Want

⸻

Act I — The Hesitation

Karp stares at the ceiling, voice low and ragged.

Karp:
“My wanting terrified me. It was bottomless. Hungry. And every time I touched it, I thought it would swallow me whole. So I tried to bind it. Shape it. If I could decide what you felt, then maybe I wouldn’t have to face what I felt.”

Kellyn lifts their head, gaze sharp.

Kellyn:
“So it wasn’t about me. It was about you surviving yourself.”

⸻

Act II — The Mirror

Karp (hoarse):
“Yes. You were… the mirror. I thought if I owned your body, I could tame the reflection. But it never worked. It only made me emptier.”

Kellyn slides their hand slowly down his arm, grounding him.

Kellyn:
“You tried to turn want into empire. To cage it. But want isn’t a cage. It’s a current. You don’t stop it — you learn how to swim.”

Karp closes his eyes, voice breaking.

Karp:
“I don’t know how.”

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning

Kellyn shifts closer, pressing palm flat to his chest, feeling the thrum beneath.

Kellyn (steady, fierce):
“You’re already doing it. Wanting me without control. Without empire. Just here. Just this heartbeat.”

Karp grips Kellyn’s wrist, trembling.

Karp (raw):
“Then don’t let me stop. Don’t let me build the cage again.”

Kellyn (soft, unwavering):
“I won’t. But you have to notice when you start hammering the bars. You have to tell me when you feel the urge to lock the door.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Wanting

Karp exhales hard, rolling onto his side so they face each other, foreheads pressed together.

Karp (whispering):
“Then this is covenant too — not to kill the wanting, not to bind it, but to name it and let it live.”

Kellyn (smiling faintly):
“Exactly. Want isn’t a monster. It’s the proof you’re still alive.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures pressed close, foreheads touching, breath shared. No ropes, no bars — just pulse and want, named aloud but not controlled.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“He thought control would save him from hunger. But covenant taught him hunger itself was holy. Not to bind. Not to own. Only to breathe through, together.”

Fade out.
End of Season 45.
