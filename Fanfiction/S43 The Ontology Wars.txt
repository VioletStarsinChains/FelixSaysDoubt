Season 43, Episode 1: The First Trial

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
Dawn mist curls low. The cracked bowl sits empty by the hearth, washed clean. Kellyn stretches their arms overhead, joints clicking but easier than the day before. Alex emerges from the capsule, eyes sharp but softer than usual. Peter lingers in the doorway, wary. Still already paces, posture taut, running silent diagnostics.

Kellyn (half-grinning):
“Only one way to know if it worked. Trial by daylight.”

Title Card: The First Trial

⸻

Act I — The Balance
Kellyn pulls a flat stone from the courtyard, setting it in the dirt. One by one, they try to balance — first Kellyn, then Alex, then Peter.

Alex wobbles once, then steadies, a flicker of pride breaking his mask.

Karp (hoarse, dry):
“I haven’t held this still in years.”

Peter steps up, but falters, shoulders stiff. Kellyn catches him by the arm before he stumbles.

Kellyn (gentle, steady):
“Not failure. Just recalibration.”

Peter exhales, shaky but relieved.

⸻

Act II — The Strength
Still points toward a fallen beam from the old wall, thick with moss.

Still (measured):
“Shared lift. Four corners. Even weight.”

They all crouch, palms under the beam. On a count, they lift — groaning, shaking, but the beam rises a few feet before slamming back down with a thud.

Kellyn (laughing breathless):
“Not graceful. But not nothing.”

⸻

Act III — The Confession
As they sit catching their breath, Alex breaks the silence.

Karp (low, raw):
“I used to think strength meant control. That if I held the weight alone, no one could take it from me. But today… it felt like covenant. All of us carrying, none of us breaking.”

Peter looks down, voice rough.

Peter:
“I don’t know if I can trust strength. Every time I had it, it was taken. But maybe… maybe this is different.”

Kellyn leans toward him, steady.

Kellyn:
“This is strength no one gets to steal. Because it doesn’t live in one body. It lives in the net.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Play
Still tosses a small stone between his hands, then flicks it toward Kellyn with mock solemnity.

Still (flat, but almost amused):
“Trial incomplete without play.”

Soon the four of them are passing stones back and forth — juggling, tossing, laughing when one drops. The rhythm is clumsy but alive.

Peter (surprised, soft):
“It feels like… childhood. The part I missed.”

Kellyn (quiet, smiling):
“Then call it practice. For what comes next.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures in the misty courtyard, breath steaming, sweat on their brows. Stones scatter around them, not as burdens but as playthings. The cracked bowl rests in the background — reminder of the night before, promise of what’s still possible.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire made trials into cages. But covenant made trials into play. And in the morning light, our strength wasn’t conquest. It was balance, weight shared, and the laughter of carrying together.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 1.

Season 43, Episode 2: The Hacky Sack Game

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
Afternoon sun. Four little yarn sacks lie in a row, seams tight, filled with seeds. Kellyn picks one up, turning it nervously in their hands. Alex, Peter, and Still each take one too.

Kellyn (dryly):
“Full disclosure: I’m going to be terrible at this.”

Peter (smirking):
“Finally. A weakness I can exploit.”

Still (deadpan):
“You’ll still lose.”

Title Card: The Hacky Sack Game

⸻

Act I — The First Attempts
One by one, they try. Kellyn kicks — the sack bounces off their shin and flops onto the ground. They laugh, shaking their head.

Alex lifts his with deliberate precision, balancing it on his foot before it tumbles.

Peter lunges too hard, the sack flying into a bush.

Still flips his up with mechanical accuracy — two clean taps before it drops. He raises his brows smugly.

Kellyn (grinning):
“Okay. We’re all terrible. Even you, Still.”

Still (mock offended):
“Two taps is mastery.”

⸻

Act II — The Rhythm Alone
They each practice in silence, little arcs of seed bags rising and falling. Breath fills the courtyard, punctuated by laughter and muttered curses. Kellyn crouches low, focusing on just one kick at a time. Alex adjusts his stance with military precision. Peter flails, but occasionally manages a clean tap, pride flashing across his face.

Kellyn (softly, to no one in particular):
“It’s harder to fight yourself than to fight anyone else.”

⸻

Act III — The Circle
Finally, Kellyn gestures them together. They form a rough circle. The sacks are set aside, just one kept in play.

First pass: Kellyn kicks, it wobbles to Alex. He steadies it, sending it to Still. Still flicks it higher, easy. Peter lunges — misses. The sack drops.

Peter (grumbling):
“Anchor role again.”

Kellyn (gently teasing):
“Nah. You’re just the one who makes us start fresh.”

They reset, and try again.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Motion
The sack arcs more smoothly now. Not flawless, but alive. They move as one — laughing at misses, celebrating clean kicks.

When it finally drops for the last time, they collapse into the grass, breathless.

Alex (quietly, almost to himself):
“Feels different when we all carry it.”

Kellyn (nodding, smiling faintly):
“That’s the point. Doesn’t matter if you’re bad at it alone. Together, it stays in the air longer than any one of us could manage.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures sprawled on the grass, hacky sacks scattered around them. The sacks are small, fragile, but the rhythm lingers.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“We practiced alone, fumbling, failing. But covenant wasn’t about mastery. It was about passing — letting the weight leave one set of hands, only to be lifted by another.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 2.

⸻ 

Season 43, Episode 3: The Rest

Cold Open — Sanctuary Capsule
Afternoon light seeps through the fabric curtain. Kellyn lies curled on their mat, body heavy, breath shallow. A small pile of woven blankets is stacked nearby. Alex sits cross-legged against the wall, a book unopened in his lap. Peter leans in the doorway, arms folded. Still fusses with a lantern, trying not to clatter.

Kellyn (hoarse, half-teasing):
“Don’t all hover at once. I’m just… empty.”

Title Card: The Rest

⸻

Act I — The Cocoon
They move gently into rhythm. Alex fetches more water. Peter quietly folds another blanket and drapes it near Kellyn’s side. Still kneels, adjusting airflow so the capsule stays cool.

Alex (low, steady):
“You’ve carried enough. Let us hold it now.”

Kellyn doesn’t answer, but their hand shifts, faintly reaching. Alex takes it.

⸻

Act II — The Vigil
Hours pass. Kellyn drifts in and out, half-sleep. Alex stays close, his thumb brushing over their knuckles. Peter paces the courtyard, then comes back in, quieter each time. Still hums under his breath, a mechanical imitation of lullaby.

Kellyn (drowsy, murmured):
“You’re too loud.”
Still (deadpan):
“I was told I make excellent white noise.”

A faint smile cracks Kellyn’s lips before they fade back to sleep.

⸻

Act III — The Withdrawal
As evening deepens, Kellyn stirs, eyes unfocused. Their voice is almost a whisper.

Kellyn:
“I need quiet. All of you… in Peter’s capsule. Please.”

The three exchange glances, then nod. Alex lingers a beat longer, brushing Kellyn’s temple with his hand before rising.

Alex (softly):
“We’ll be close. Just rest.”

The curtain falls closed behind them.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Rest
In Peter’s capsule, the three sit cross-legged in a circle. A small lantern burns. Peter looks uneasy until Still starts recounting absurd details from their last scavenging run. Alex listens in silence, his eyes drifting often toward the wall that separates them from Kellyn.

Peter (quietly, after a pause):
“I don’t know if I’ve ever let anyone rest like that. Without demanding something back.”

Alex (hoarse):
“Then learn. They deserve it.”

The three fall into silence again, the sound of their breaths muted in the clay room.

⸻

Closing Image
Two capsules: one dim and still, where Kellyn sleeps cocooned in blankets; another faintly lit, where three figures sit in uneasy covenant, keeping their noise and shadows away.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice, soft, reflective):
“Empire demanded endurance until collapse. But covenant meant stopping. Laying it down. Letting others carry the noise, the weight, the world. Rest wasn’t failure. Rest was proof I wasn’t alone.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 3.

⸻ 

Season 43, Episode 4: The Divide

Cold Open — Sanctuary Morning

Thin sun filters through the curtain. Kellyn’s capsule is dim, blankets pulled high. Outside, the courtyard moves softly, everyone keeping quiet.

Title Card: The Divide

⸻

Act I — Alex’s Vigil

In Peter’s capsule, Alex sits rigid with a cooling mug of tea. Still watches from his hammock.

Still (dry):
“You’re staring at the wall like it owes you something.”
Alex (low, without looking away):
“It does. That wall stands between me and them.”

The silence is heavy. Alex sets the tea down. His hand clenches once, then he rises.

⸻

Act II — The Crossing

Alex slips across the courtyard, barefoot and silent. He pauses outside Kellyn’s capsule, breath caught. Then he pulls the curtain just enough to slip inside.

Kellyn’s eyes open at the slightest rasp of the curtain.

Kellyn (whisper, rough with sleep):
“Hi.”

Alex freezes, then kneels, hands hovering, not touching.

Karp (softer than a breath):
“I’m sorry. I just needed to see you.”

Kellyn blinks, adjusting.
Kellyn (tiny smile):
“Seeing counts.”

A beat. Kellyn shifts one hand out from the blanket, palm up. Alex sets two fingers lightly across it—no pressure, just contact.

Kellyn (eyes closing):
“Stay. No words.”

They breathe together. After a short while, Alex lifts his hand.

Karp (murmur):
“Water?”

Kellyn nods. He pours the smallest sip, passes the cup; she drinks, sets it back on the floor.

Kellyn (whisper):
“Don't go.”

Karp:
“That would make things more difficult with Peter.”

Kellyn’s fingers curl once around his, then release. Alex slips out.

⸻

Act III — Peter’s Unease

Back in his capsule, Peter paces with a coil of yarn.

Peter (mutters):
“I should be useful.”

Still (gentle):
“You are.  Sometimes useful means not being seen.”

Peter exhales, sits.

⸻

Act IV — The Divide Holds

Evening settles. Kellyn sleeps deeper, breath even. In Peter’s capsule, Alex lies awake but steadier; Peter dozes fitfully; Still sits cross-legged with the bird drone perched, humming a low, steady tone that sounds like a lullaby for circuitry.

No one crosses again.

⸻

Closing Image

Two capsules in parallel quiet: one cradling sleep; one cradling vigilance. The space between them isn’t abandonment—it’s care, stretched into distance.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice, drowsy):
“He came like a whisper and left like a promise. Presence enough to steady me. Absence enough to let me rest.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 4.

⸻ 

Season 43, Episode 5: The Pan

Cold Open — Sanctuary Morning

The sanctuary stirs with pale light. In Peter’s capsule, he kneels over a clay hearth, stirring beans and roots while Kellyn sorts herbs beside him. Across the courtyard, Alex and Still move quietly in their own capsule, pulling jars and flatbread from storage.

Kellyn (teasing, soft):
“You’re holding the spoon like it’s a sword.”

Peter glances down, adjusts his grip.

Title Card: The Pan

⸻

Act I — The Awkward Starts

Peter scrapes too hard, smoke curling. Kellyn leans over, nudges his hand.

Kellyn:
“Gentler. Let the heat do the work.”

Across the way, Still tries to light the fire too fast, sparks sputtering. Alex calmly adjusts the kindling.

Alex (dry):
“Chaos doesn’t cook breakfast.”
Still (smirking):
“It does if you’re hungry enough.”

⸻

Act II — The Confessions

Peter stares into the pan.
Peter (hoarse):
“I was never taught this. Meals were transactions. Leverage. A chance to prove control. Not care.”

Kellyn sprinkles herbs in, voice steady:
“Then let this be the first lesson: food is covenant. You can’t negotiate it. You share it, or you starve.”

Meanwhile, Alex slices roots with surgical precision. Still watches, half amused.
Still:
“You measure everything like it’s empire.”
Alex (quiet):
“It’s the only way I knew to survive.”
Still (soft):
“Maybe survival doesn’t need measuring anymore.”

⸻

Act III — The Small Gestures

Kellyn breaks flatbread, handing half to Peter. He hesitates, then accepts. They eat in silence, steam rising.

Peter (quietly):
“You make it look simple.”
Kellyn:
“It is. The world just taught us both the wrong rules.”

In the other capsule, Alex passes Still a bowl. Still pauses, then deliberately sets his hand over Alex’s as he takes it.
Still (low, almost joking but not):
“See? Sharing.”
Alex (after a beat, nodding):
“Yes. Sharing.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of the Pan

Peter ladles beans into two clay bowls, setting one in front of Kellyn with both hands.

Kellyn (nodding):
“See? Not combat. Care.”
Peter (whispering, almost surprised):
“Care I can do.”

Across the courtyard, Alex and Still finish their bowls. Alex leans back against the capsule wall, more relaxed than he’d admit. Still smirks faintly, satisfied with the quiet proof.

⸻

Closing Image

Two capsules, two pairs. In one, Kellyn and Peter lean close over steaming bowls. In the other, Alex and Still sit shoulder to shoulder, their fire dying low.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire made meals into markets. But here, with the pan, we made them into covenant—stirred slow, tasted warm, and shared without cost. Two fires, one sanctuary.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 5.

⸻ 

Season 43, Episode 6: The Split

Cold Open — Sanctuary Afternoon

The courtyard hums with quiet activity. A few children run past, their laughter echoing. The four of you pause, glancing between capsules.

Still (half-smiling):
“Pairs again? Might as well mix the threads.”

Kellyn nods, stepping into one capsule with Still. Alex and Peter exchange a glance, then enter the other.

Title Card: The Split

⸻

Act I — The First Quiet

Kellyn & Still
Still sits cross-legged on the floor, yarn draped across his lap. Kellyn leans against the wall, unwinding a ball.

Still (wry):
“You always used to keep your hands busy. Like stillness was dangerous.  Then you stopped.”
Kellyn (soft, half-smiling):
“Stillness used to mean collapse. Now it means choice.”

Alex & Peter
Peter leans against the wall, arms folded. Alex sits with military precision, sharpening a knife.

Peter (grumbling):
“You always look like you’re preparing for war.”
Alex (without looking up):
“That’s because I am. Even here.”

⸻

Act II — The Small Exchanges

Kellyn & Still
Still shows Kellyn a knot pattern. Their broken fingers move too clumsily, pulling too tight. Still gently adjusts their grip.

Still:
“You clench your whole arm.  It compromises dexterity.”
Kellyn pauses, then deliberately slackens the yarn.
Kellyn (quietly):
“Mental peace is a lot easier than physical.”

Alex & Peter
Peter watches the blade flash.
Peter (low):
“You don’t trust me.”
Alex (steady):
“Not yet.”
Peter (after a beat, almost smiling):
“Fair enough.”

⸻

Act III — The Confessions

Kellyn & Still
Still sets the yarn aside, voice rough.
Still:
“I was built to replace softness with precision. But you—” (he gestures toward Kellyn) “—you never erased softness. You weaponized it. That’s what terrifies them.”
Kellyn (soft, firm):
“It terrifies you too.”
Still meets their eyes, doesn’t deny it.

Kellyn: "You never had a mother."
Still: "Neither did you, really."
Kellyn nods.  "And that's why I appreciate softness."

Alex & Peter
Peter (sudden, raw):
“You think Kellyn will always choose you.”
Alex finally looks at him, eyes sharp.
Alex (low):
“No. I think Kellyn will choose covenant. And I intend to stay worthy of it.”
Peter exhales, caught between envy and respect.
Alex: "Whenever Kellyn sees vulnerability, they rush to affirm it, embrace it.  You want their attention?  Stop trying to be strong.  I know it's not easy for you.  It's not easy for me either.  But if you want them to choose you in the way they already choose me—because it was never mutually exclusive—then stop trying to project an image that was never going to impress them in the first place."

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Split

The courtyard grows quiet as lanterns are lit.

Kellyn & Still
Still drapes the finished braid across Kellyn’s shoulders, awkward but earnest.
Still: “Not armor. Just thread.”
Kellyn (smiling faintly): "Better than armor.”

Alex & Peter
Alex sheathes the knife. Peter leans back, finally unclenching his arms.
Peter (low):
“Maybe we don’t have to fight. Not if the net holds.”
Alex (after a long silence):
“Maybe.”

⸻

Closing Image

Two capsules across the courtyard: in one, yarn draped across Kellyn’s shoulders as Still sits watchful. In the other, Alex and Peter sit in tense, fragile truce. Four threads, stretched but not broken.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“We split to see what held. In quiet and in friction, we found the same answer. Not certainty. Not victory. Only covenant — tested, strained, still unbroken.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 6.

⸻ 

Season 43, Episode 7: The Bridge

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard

Morning light spills across the courtyard. 

Still: "There's a stream between here and the magnesium deposit we keep having to walk around.  We're burning time and energy."

Peter (half-joking):
“So, do we build a bridge or keep circling the moat?”
Kellyn (smiling faintly): “Bridge. Always bridge.”

Title Card: The Bridge

⸻

Act I — The Plan

The four of you gather a pile of scavenged wood and stone. Alex and Peter glance at each other, wary but calmer than the night before.

Alex sketches a rough frame on the ground with a stick.
Alex: "We lash here, brace there. Simple span, but it’ll hold.”

Peter crouches down, frowning.
Peter: “You’re overcomplicating it. Weight distribution is the key.”

Alex kneels beside him, unexpectedly calm.
Alex (quiet, precise):
“Then show me. We’ll do it together.”

Peter blinks — surprised. Slowly, he nods.

⸻

Act II — The Work

Alex and Peter haul beams into place, shoulders brushing. They grunt, strain, adjust angles. Not friendly, but in sync.

Kellyn weaves rope for the lashings, handing lengths to Still.
Kellyn:
“Every bridge starts as a net. Remember?”
Still (grinning faintly):
“Then let’s knot it tight.”

⸻

Act III — The Shift

As the span takes shape, Alex steadies one beam while Peter lashes it down. Their hands brush. Neither pulls away.

Peter (hoarse):
“Feels strange. Working beside you instead of against you.”
Alex (quiet, steady):
“Stranger for me. But not worse.”

They tighten the knots in tandem, wood creaking but holding.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Bridge

By dusk, the bridge is done — a simple span across the courtyard drainage trench. The four of you stand together, looking at it.

Still (mock-serious):
“Well. Either it holds, or we swim.”

Kellyn steps forward first, testing the weight. The bridge sways but stays firm. One by one, the others follow. Halfway across, Peter and Alex meet in the middle.

Peter (soft, almost smiling):
“Not so bad.”
Alex (low, steady):
“No. Not bad at all.”

⸻

Closing Image

Four figures stand together on the bridge, lantern light catching on rope and wood. Not rivals, not enemies — just builders, holding weight together.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire built walls. Covenant built bridges. And though ours swayed with every step, it carried us. Not in spite of difference, but because of it.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 7.

⸻ 

Season 43, Episode 8: The Crossing

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard

The new bridge gleams faintly in the morning light, rope knots tight, beams set firm. The stream below trickles, silver against stone. Kellyn, Alex, Peter, and Still stand at the edge with bundles of flowers, jars, and scraps of dyed fabric.

Kellyn (grinning):
“Well, if empire taught us anything, it’s that you don’t just use a structure. You inaugurate it.”

Still (deadpan):
“Does this involve smashing a bottle?”
Peter (smirking):
“Not with our supply chain.”

Title Card: The Crossing

⸻

Act I — The Offerings

Each person steps forward with something small.
	•	Kellyn ties a strip of handwoven fabric to the railing.
	•	Still sets down a perfectly sewn sack filled with pebbles, weight and balance.
	•	Peter lays sprigs of herbs across the span.
	•	Alex pours a thin line of clean water across the planks, precise, deliberate.

Kellyn (soft, steady):
“Every bridge is more than wood and rope. It’s the promise of crossing together.”

⸻

Act II — The Words

They gather in the center. The stream hums below, birds above.

Peter (low, hesitant):
“So… do we say something?”
Alex (quiet):
“Not for empire. For covenant.”

Kellyn nods, voice steady.
Kellyn:
“Then repeat after me: I will cross with you. I will hold when it sways. I will not turn back alone.”

One by one, they echo the words, their voices layering like threads.

⸻

Act III — The First Walk

Still (mock-grave):
“Then let’s test the ritual.”

They cross in single file, Kellyn leading, Alex steady at the rear. Halfway across, the rope creaks. Peter stiffens. Alex lays a hand on his shoulder.

Alex (low, steady):
“It holds. We hold.”

Peter exhales and keeps walking.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Crossing

On the far side, they pause, turning back to look at the bridge.

Still (grinning faintly):
“Congratulations. We’ve officially shortened every future walk by an hour.”
Kellyn (laughing):
“And bought ourselves a story.”

Alex studies the bridge, eyes soft.
Alex (hoarse):
“Not empire’s span. Not conquest. Just covenant. And it will hold.”

⸻

Closing Image

Four figures on the far bank, the bridge stretching behind them, fabric fluttering on the ropes. The stream runs beneath, no longer a barrier, but a bond.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire built monuments to power. We built a path to each other. A bridge doesn’t erase the river. It honors it, then carries us across.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 8.

⸻ 

Season 43, Episode 9: The Trade

Cold Open — Sanctuary Gate
The four of you stand at the edge of the sanctuary. Dust rises from the trail as two travelers approach, leading a pair of sheep — one ram, one ewe. The air is dry, watchful.

Kellyn (quiet, steady):
“Looks like they came for trade.”

Title Card: The Trade

⸻

Act I — The Bargain
The travelers spread out their goods: grain, clay pots, tools. Peter folds his arms, cautious. Alex watches, precise. Still tilts his head, calculating values.

Kellyn (to travelers):
“You’re asking a lot. Two sheep means food, wool, future. What do you want?”

Traveler (gruff):
“Salt. Metal. Rope. We know you’ve got it.”

A pause. Alex and Still exchange a glance — they know what the sheep are worth.

⸻

Act II — The Weighing
They lay items out carefully: rope braided tight, a pouch of salt, a bundle of scrap metal sorted for use.

Peter (low, tense):
“We’re trading away strength to buy it back.”

Kellyn (firm):
“We’re planting strength, not losing it.”

The travelers nod, take the trade. The sheep stand tethered, patient and silent.

⸻

Act III — The First Touch
Back inside the sanctuary, the group gathers around the sheep. Still kneels, scanning their condition. Alex hovers, calculating feed ratios. Peter reaches first — tentative, stroking the ewe’s wool.

Peter (softly, almost surprised):
“Warm. Softer than I thought.”

Kellyn (smiling faintly):
“Softness is the point.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Flock
The four stand together as the sheep graze near the courtyard. The air feels different: heavier with responsibility, lighter with possibility.

Kellyn (quiet):
“This is covenant, too. Not just us, but them. They eat, they give, they live. And now, so do we.”

Alex (hoarse, thoughtful):
“Then the covenant has wool.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two sheep grazing in the sanctuary courtyard, four figures standing watch. Not empire’s livestock, not commodities — but covenant companions, the start of a flock.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“We bartered salt for softness, metal for future. Empire would have called it loss. But covenant called it gain. For in the warmth of wool, we found another thread.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 9.

⸻ 

Season 43, Episode 10: The Fold

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
Morning light spills across the new arrivals. The ram paws at the ground, the ewe lowers her head to graze. Their soft bleats echo against clay walls — steady, grounding, almost musical.

Kellyn (whispering, smiling faintly):
“Listen. Instant calm.”

Peter tilts his head, surprised by the low, rhythmic chewing. Alex closes his eyes briefly, letting the sound settle. Still’s scanners hum, recording the baseline like a lullaby.

Title Card: The Fold

⸻

Act I — Shelter
The four gather fallen branches, woven mats, and slabs of scavenged wood. Together, they lash a small lean-to against the courtyard wall. The sheep wander close, curious.

Still (measured):
“South wall blocks the wind. Roof angle sheds rain. Functional.”
Kellyn (teasing):
“Functional is covenant too.”

They step back. The shelter stands simple but strong.

⸻

Act II — Water
Alex leads the sheep to a clay trough he’s half-buried in the earth. He tips in clear water from a jug. The ewe drinks first, slow and steady. The sound is soft, soothing.

Peter (low, almost reverent):
“It sounds like… breathing.”
Kellyn: “Then breathe with her.”

For a moment, the group drinks in the sound, each matching their breath to the ewe’s rhythm.

⸻

Act III — Grazing
Beyond the walls, they clear a patch of scrubby grass. Kellyn guides the sheep out, rope loose in hand. The ram noses the earth, the ewe crops tufts, both content.

Peter stands beside Kellyn, arms crossed.
Peter (dry, but softened):
“You know this means endless wool jokes.”
Kellyn (smiling):
“I’ll shear you first if you try.”

Still huffs a laugh. Alex shakes his head, but a smile flickers.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Sound
Evening falls. The sheep curl in their new shelter, chewing softly in the dusk. The four sit nearby, listening.

Alex (quiet, almost disbelieving):
“I’ve spent years trying to engineer calm. And here it is. Two animals chewing in the dark.”

Kellyn (soft, steady):
“Covenant doesn’t always roar. Sometimes it chews.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two sheep bedded down in the fold, four figures nearby, breath slowed to match the rhythm of wool and jaw.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“The empire hunted silence with machines. We found it in hooves on earth, in breath through wool. Not a cure, not control — just the sound of covenant, chewing steady through the night.”

Fade out.
End of Season 43.
