Season 32, Episode 1: The Pattern

Cold Open — Capsule Interior
The rope hangs ready, more lengths coiled neatly on the mat. You run your fingers along the fibers, testing their give. Alex kneels across from you, studying the knots with reverence.

You (wry, teasing):
“You’re staring like the rope is a holy text.”
Karp (low, steady):
“Maybe it is. Every knot, every bind — a scripture in tension.”

Title Card: The Pattern

⸻

Act I — The First Knot
He threads the rope around your wrist, pulling slow, deliberate. No force, just contact. You lift your other hand, guiding his.

You (soft, instructive):
“Don’t just tie. Listen. Rope talks back if you let it.”
Karp (whispering):
“I was always better at command than conversation.”
You: "Command is conversation too.  You just never let yourself hear the other side."

The rope slides across skin, and for once, he follows your lead.

⸻

Act II — The Web
Soon, the knots cross over your torso, weaving into a harness that breathes with you. Each inhale presses the ropes close, each exhale eases them. Alex moves with sharp concentration, but softer than empire’s logic.

Karp (raw, confessing):
“In empire, rope was metaphor. Binding people to contracts, to codes, to me. I thought it was strength. But here, every knot makes me weaker. Every pass reminds me you could slip away.”

You (firm, tender):
“Alex, where else would I go?"

⸻

Act III — The Suspension
He threads the final line through the ladder’s top rung. You lean back, letting the harness take your weight, body lifting inch by inch. The floor drifts away again. Alex braces, hands steady on the rope.

Karp (hoarse, trembling):
“This is what I feared most. Letting go of the illusion of control. Admitting I was only ever strong because I refused to feel the rope burning my palms.”

You sway gently, eyes soft.

You:
“The nice thing about illusions is that nothing changes when you let go of them, because they were never real to begin with.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Knots
You twist, rope biting into skin, breath sharp but steady. He watches, transfixed, until you reach out a bound hand and brush his cheek.

You (soft, certain):
“I’m not trapped. I’m held. That’s the difference.”
Karp (voice breaking):
“And I’m not binding. I’m bearing witness.”

He lowers you slowly, untying each knot with care, as though undoing years of empire with every pull.

⸻

Closing Image
The ropes coil loose on the floor, marks still pressed into your skin. Two figures sit close in the dim, one marked, one trembling, both bound by more than rope.

Narration (your voice):
“Empire’s knots were contracts, cages, chains. But covenant’s knots were pattern — rope breathing with skin, tension turned into trust. Not trap, not control. Just being held, and holding back.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 15.

⸻ 

Season 32, Episode 2: The Guest Knot

Cold Open — Capsule Hearth
Lanterns glow warm. A pot of stew simmers, steam curling into the clay air. The rope from last night still lies coiled in the corner, faint marks still pressed into your skin. A knock at the door.

You (calling out):
“Come in, Peter.”

He enters, a little stiff, balancing a basket of flatbread. His eyes catch on the rope before anything else.

Thiel (dry):
“So… new décor?”

Alex smirks faintly. You just shrug.

Title Card: The Guest Knot

⸻

Act I — The Uneasy Table
The three of you sit close. The food is plain but warm. For a while, there’s only chewing, bowls passing. Peter keeps glancing at the rope, then away.

Finally, he sets his bread down.

Thiel (low, halting):
“I never trusted being held. Not by people, not by systems. Holding always meant leverage. You bind, you own. That was the rule.”

You (soft, cutting):
“And did it ever make you feel less alone?”

He flinches, shakes his head.

⸻

Act II — The Rope on the Floor
You pick up the rope, lay it on the floor between the three of you.

You:
“It doesn’t own. It doesn’t command. It just connects. If you let it.”

Alex stays silent, watching Peter carefully. Peter’s jaw works. He leans down, fingers brushing the rope — tentative, almost reverent.

Thiel (hoarse):
“All my life, I tied things down so I wouldn’t vanish. But it was me disappearing all along.”

⸻

Act III — The Confession
The air is thick. Peter’s voice breaks.

Thiel:
“I was jealous of you both. Not because you were strong, but because you could be seen in your weakness. I couldn’t risk that. I told myself control was survival. But really, it was cowardice. I punished every softness I saw, because I couldn’t bear my own.”

Alex’s gaze softens, though he doesn’t speak. You lean forward.

You (quietly):
“Then maybe tonight, stop punishing. Start practicing.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of the Table
You slide the rope across the floor until it rests in front of Peter’s hands. He doesn’t tie anything. He just holds it. Knuckles white, breath shaking, but holding.

Thiel (whispering):
“Maybe I can learn. Maybe the knot doesn’t have to close.”

You nod.

You:
“Every covenant starts with open hands.”

⸻

Peter stands stiffly, blindfold in hand, hesitant.

You (calm, steady):
“You don’t have to.”

Peter (low, trembling):
“I know. That’s why I’m trying.”

He ties the blindfold himself. Alex nods once.

⸻

Act V — The Lift
The ropes tighten, slow and deliberate. Peter’s body rises until his feet leave the earth. His breath comes shallow, muscles straining with instinctive resistance.

Karp (quiet, anchoring):
“Breathe. You’re not owned. You’re held.”

Peter exhales shakily.

⸻

Act VI — The Textures
You step close, brushing a strip of soft linen along his forearm. He flinches, then steadies. Alex follows with rougher burlap across his calf.

Peter (hoarse, disoriented):
“I used to think touch was only interrogation. Pressure points. Pain. I don’t… I don’t understand this.”

You (soft, playful):
“Not interrogation. Exploration.”

You switch textures — a feather, a length of cool copper, your own hand. Each sensation draws a different shiver, a different gasp.

Alex lays his palm against Peter’s chest, steady heartbeat beneath.

Karp (low, steady):
“You’re not disappearing. You’re being seen.”

⸻

Act VII — The Covenant of Rope
The three of you work in rhythm: suspension steady, textures shifting, silence carrying more than words. Peter’s body slackens little by little, surrender turning into presence.

Finally, you lower him gently to the clay floor. He lies still, blindfold damp with tears.

Peter (whispering):
“I thought knots closed. But they opened something I’d buried.”

You (quiet, affirming):
“Then that’s where covenant begins.”

⸻

Closing Image
Three figures in lantern glow: one resting on the floor, two kneeling close, rope slack between their hands. Not cage, not leverage — just suspension giving way to release.

Narration (your voice):
“He thought rope was disappearance. But suspended, blindfolded, touched, he found another shape: not control, not punishment, but covenant — held, seen, alive.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 2.

⸻ 

Season 32, Episode 3: The Flight

Cold Open — Capsule Courtyard, Night
The same frame stands waiting, ropes coiled and ready. Alex runs his fingers along the knots you tied earlier, testing their give. His jaw is set, but there’s a flicker in his eyes — anticipation, and fear.

You (soft, teasing):
“Your turn to fly, Fishface.”

He exhales, removes his coat, and nods once.

Title Card: The Flight

⸻

Act I — The Lift
The ropes tighten around his torso, thighs, and hips, spreading weight evenly. Slowly, he rises, muscles taut at first, then lengthening into stillness. Suspended, his body sways gently with each breath.

Peter (quiet, almost reverent):
“Float like a kite, don't sting at all.”

Alex laughs hoarsely despite himself.

⸻

Act II — The Shifts
You guide the ropes, shifting his weight until he tilts, spins slowly, then steadies. He closes his eyes, surrendering. Peter steps closer with a length of silk, trailing it across Alex’s ankle, up his calf.

Karp (ragged breath):
“I used to dream of control. Always control. But this—this is… release.”

You brush your palm over his chest, grounding him.

You (soft, steady):
“No empire. Just gravity. Just breath. Just us.”

⸻

Act III — The Confession
Suspended midair, Alex’s voice cracks.

Karp:
“I spent decades binding others because I was terrified to be bound myself. Terrified that if I stopped steering, I’d plummet. But now—hanging here—every knot feels like proof I can still be held.”

Peter (hoarse):
“Now you don’t have to steer.”

You: "People pay good money to plummet.  It's called a roller coaster."

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Flight
You and Peter steady the ropes, keeping him suspended a moment longer. Alex breathes, each exhale loosening him further. His back cracks, years of tension releasing.  Finally, you lower him gently back to the clay floor.

He lies still, chest heaving, rope marks faint against his skin. You kneel beside him, pressing your lips lightly to his temple.

Karp (whispering):
“I thought flight was empire. I never knew it could be covenant.”

You (smiling faintly):
“Welcome to gravity.”

⸻

Closing Image
Lantern light flickers across the courtyard: Alex sprawled against the clay, rope slack, you and Peter crouched close. Not pilot, not controller — just man, bound, released, alive.

Narration (your voice):
“He thought flight meant ruling from above. But suspended, he found another shape: not empire, not fall, but covenant — rope, breath, release.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 3.

⸻ 

Season 32, Episode 4: The Lines

Cold Open — Capsule Interior
The capsule glows golden with lantern light. Ropes stretch in a chaotic lattice, tied from ladder to post, from beam to bench. The air feels charged, like a web has been spun through the room.

You (grinning, satisfied):
“New game. Simple rules. Don’t touch the rope.”

Alex eyes the setup like a general surveying battlefield terrain. Peter tilts his head, already calculating.

Title Card: The Lines

⸻

Act I — The First Attempt
Peter goes first, crouching low. He slips between two taut ropes, careful, deliberate. Halfway through, his shoulder brushes one. The rope twangs faintly.

You (mock solemn):
“FAILURE.  Execution by broccoli.”

Peter groans. Alex snorts. The air lightens.

⸻

Act II — The Strategist
Alex steps in next. He moves with careful precision, pausing often, mapping angles like equations in his head. You watch, amused.

You (teasing):
“Empire boy, turning play into calculus.”
Karp (deadpan):
“Precision is survival.”
You: "The history of evolution is a series of accidents, but okay."

But when he tries to twist through a narrow gap, his sleeve snags. He freezes, then laughs, raw.

Karp:
“I will concede that point.”

⸻

Act III — The Chaos Path
Your turn. Instead of calculation, you barrel forward with your eyes closed, listening for the way the ropes obstruct ambient sounds--improvising, ducking, rolling, kicking off the wall to vault through. Every move reckless but graceful, playing without planning.

You land on the far side, grinning, breathless.

You:
“See? Not that hard.”

Alex shakes his head, incredulous, but something soft sparks in his eyes — envy and admiration all at once.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Lines
The three of you try again, laughing, failing, trading strategies. Each brush of rope stings less, each near miss becomes play. At one point Alex steadies Peter’s shoulder; at another, you pull Alex clear before he topples.

By the end, all three of you sit cross-legged in the middle of the web, ropes humming faintly in the lantern light.

Peter (quiet, almost reverent):
“In empire, every line was a barrier. Here, every line is a game.”
You (soft, steady):
“And every game is covenant, if we let it be.  Oh yeah, I forgot to mention.  Whoever touches the rope most wins.  So you both win, and I lose!"

⸻

Closing Image
The capsule strung with ropes, three figures tangled in laughter at its center. Not empire’s traps, not cages — just lines, turned to covenant by play.

Narration (your voice):
“They thought lines meant borders and borders meant power. But here, lines meant movement, laughter, trust. And covenant meant playing through without fear of touching.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 4.

⸻ 

Season 32, Episode 5: The Jump

Cold Open — Capsule Courtyard
Morning sun streaks through the trees. Two ropes lie coiled at your feet. You grin at Alex and Peter.

You (teasing):
“Time to see if either of you billionaires has rhythm.”

Peter groans. Alex folds his arms, pretending unbothered.

Title Card: The Jump

⸻

Act I — The Spin
You and Peter turn the ropes first. The sound of them slapping the dirt is crisp, steady. Alex watches, calculating, then steps in. His first attempt is clumsy — ropes tangling instantly.

Karp (grumbling):
“Empire prepared me for many things. Not this.”
You (laughing):
“Empire never prepared you for fun.”

You reset, slower this time. Alex catches the rhythm, knees lifting, body loosening.

⸻

Act II — The Confession in Motion
As he jumps, Alex blurts between breaths:

Karp:
“I used to think joy had to be controlled. Measured. Otherwise it would disappear. I didn’t realize it was something you enter. Like this.”

You keep the ropes spinning. Peter nods, watching closely.

Peter (quiet): "I don’t even remember the last time I played.”

Kellyn: "Then get in here.”

⸻

Act III — The Tangle
Peter hesitates, then sets down the ropes and steps in. Alex takes his place.  The ropes whip around Peter now, nearly catching the back of his head. He stumbles, laughing. Kellyn and Alex stop the ropes, catching their breath.

Kellyn (grinning):
“Not bad for a first attempt.”

Alex and Peter exchange a look — old rivals, now teammates fumbling through childhood they never had.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Rhythm
This time, all three of them trade places: turning, jumping, laughing. Ropes blur, feet slap earth. No empire, no calculation— just bodies moving, breathless and alive.

Alex (hoarse but smiling):
“Maybe covenant isn’t stillness. Maybe it’s rhythm. Shared rhythm.”

Kellyn (panting with effort):
“Now you’re catching on.”

⸻

Closing Image
Three figures in the courtyard, ropes whipping bright arcs through the air. Laughter breaking like sunlight through trees — play as covenant, rhythm as survival.

Narration (Kellyn's voice):
“They thought joy had to be managed, that play was for children. But covenant found its rhythm in rope and breath, in stumbles and laughter, in learning to jump together.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 5.

⸻

Season 32, Episode 6: The Balance

Cold Open — Capsule Interior
The ropes from Double Dutch are piled in a corner, still humming with yesterday’s energy. Tonight, lantern light glows low. Kellyn clears a space in the middle of the capsule and glance at Alex and Peter.

Kellyn (grinning):
“Ever played Sit, Stand, Lean?”

Alex arches an eyebrow. Peter shakes his head.

Kellyn (teasing):
“Perfect. You’ll learn fast. No empire logic allowed.”

Title Card: The Balance

⸻

Act I — The Rules
Kellyn explains: three people, three positions. At any moment, one sits, one stands, one leans. No repeats. Constant motion, constant adjustment.

Kellyn demonstrates by sitting cross-legged. Alex stays standing. Peter hesitates, then leans against Alex’s shoulder.

Kellyn (smirking):
“See? Easy.”

⸻

Act II — The Flow
The rhythm builds. Kellyn stands, Alex drops to sit, Peter shifts to lean against Kellyn. Laughter sparks when they all move too fast and collapse into a heap.

Peter (laughing, breathless): "This is absurd.”

Kellyn: "Exactly.”

The game resets, movements smoother now, transitions intuitive.

⸻

Act III — The Confession in Play
As Peter leans against Kellyn, he murmurs, low:

Peter (hoarse):
“I never trusted anyone enough to lean before. Not really.”

A beat later, Alex speaks while kneeling:

Karp (quiet):
“And I never trusted myself to hold anyone up.”

The game pauses, silence heavy but soft. Kellyn rests a hand briefly on each of their shoulders.

Kellyn (steady):
“You’re both holding fine.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Balance
They all move again, slower, almost meditative. Sit, stand, lean — fluid, wordless. Each shift becomes less about the rules and more about presence. By the end, they're all leaning together, a crooked tripod of warmth and balance.

Alex (softly, almost smiling):
“Empire was stand or fall. Covenant is sit, stand, lean.”

Kellyn: "And sometimes collapse.”

Laughter breaks the stillness, but softer this time — not frantic, just release.

⸻

Closing Image
Three figures tangled together in the lantern glow. Not hierarchy, not empire positions — just balance, improvised, fragile, real.

Narration (Kellyn's voice):
“They thought balance was power. But covenant made balance into play — sit, stand, lean. No empire, no strategy. Just bodies shifting, learning to hold, and letting go.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 6.

⸻ 

Season 32, Episode 7: The Reckoning of Species

Cold Open — Capsule Night
The lantern burns low, shadows stretching across clay walls. The loose ropes from last night’s game still sway gently. You sit cross-legged, tracing a groove in the floor. Alex sits across from you, tense. Peter hovers near the doorway, holding back — until you glance up.

Kellyn (quiet):
“Come in. This one’s for all of us.”

Peter exhales, shuts the door, and sits.

Title Card: The Reckoning of Species

⸻

Act I — Your Confession
The silence is heavy. You speak first.

Kellyn (low, steady):
“I need to confess something. For years, I believed humanity was a failed species. That the only hope for the planet, for every other form of life, was our eradication. It didn’t even feel like belief. It felt like fact. Like math.”

Alex and Peter both flinch, but you go on.

Kellyn (softer):
“I know now I was wrong. Humanity isn’t failed. Just sick. And sickness can heal.”

⸻

Act II — Alex’s Confession
Alex exhales hard, voice rough.

Karp: “Then I need to confess something too. My control, my torture — that was the reason you thought humanity was a failure. I made despair feel inevitable. Your body became the proof for my empire logic. I didn’t just watch you suffer. I manufactured it.”

His hands tremble. He lowers his head.

Karp (hoarse):
“I turned survival into a sentence. I made you believe extinction was mercy.”

⸻

Act III — Peter’s Confession
Peter shifts, voice thick.

Peter: "And I made it worse. My envy. My punishment. Every time I mocked or undermined you, it wasn’t about you. It was about me. I hated the part of myself that had already died. The softness. The femininity. I punished you for carrying openly what I had buried. I told myself it was disgust. But it was fear. And I made you think the whole species deserved to burn, because I couldn’t bear to see myself alive in you.”

He bows his head, ashamed.

⸻

Act IV — The Reckoning Together
You lean forward, voice calm but sharp.

Kellyn: "You both made me believe it. But I don’t believe it anymore. You were sick. Punished, poisoned, stripped of softness. And I don’t forgive the empire for that. But I can survive with you. Not because you deserve it. Because survival is the only covenant worth keeping.”

Alex looks up, eyes shining.

Karp (whispering):
“Then let me survive with you.”

Peter (hoarse):
“Let me, too. Not empire. Not envy. Just… staying.”

⸻

Closing Image
Three figures in the lantern glow, hands overlapping on the clay floor. Not eradication. Not empire. Just survival, fragile and shared.

Narration (Kellyn's voice):
“I once thought humanity’s end was mercy. But covenant showed me otherwise. Not eradication. Not despair. Just survival. Not alone — together.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 7.

⸻

Season 32, Episode 8: Three Questions

Cold Open — Sanctuary Walk
Morning light filters through branches. The three of them walk side by side — Kellyn in the middle, Alex to one side, Peter to the other. A basket of bread and a clay jug swing gently from Kellyn's hands, small offerings for the doors you’ll knock on.

Kellyn (quiet, almost playful):
“Alright, gentlemen. Today’s work is simple. Three questions. Nothing more.”

Alex tilts his head, curious.
Peter fidgets with his sleeves, uneasy but willing.

Title Card: The Three Questions

⸻

Act I — The First Door
The three of them knock. An older woman opens. Her eyes widen at the sight of them, then soften. Kellyn passes her bread, then asks:

Kellyn: "Who do you love?”

She smiles faintly.
"My granddaughter."

Peter asks next: "Who did you last forgive?”

Her face clouds, but she answers, "My son," voice steady.

Alex finishes: "And who do you still need to forgive?”

She sighs, long and heavy, and says nothing more.

The silence is enough. The three bow in thanks before stepping away.

⸻

Act II — The Middle Doors
Door after door, the pattern repeats. Some laugh at the questions. Some weep. Some shut their doors without answering at all. Nothing is recorded.  The experience occurs, then disintegrates, as it should.

Alex (quietly, between doors):
“This feels heavier than empire briefings ever did.”

Kellyn (softly, steady):
“That’s because you can't amass any more power from it.”

⸻

Act III — The Last Door
At the end of the path, the three of them reach the last house. You knock. No one answers. You glance at each other — and Alex, uncharacteristically, laughs under his breath.

Karp (wry, hoarse):
“Who do I love? Kellyn. Who did I last forgive? Myself, barely. Who do I still need to forgive? Everyone.”

Peter exhales sharply, then adds:
“Who do I love? My lost softness. Who did I last forgive? Alex. Who do I still need to forgive? Myself.”

You sit down on the step, hands folded.
You (quiet, almost whispering):
“Who do I love? Both of you. Who did I last forgive? The world. Who do I still need to forgive? My 'father.'"

Silence falls — but this time, it feels like covenant.

⸻

Closing Image
Three figures on the final doorstep, bread basket empty, jug dry, page full of names. Not empire, not judgment — just questions echoing like lantern light through the sanctuary.

Narration (Kellyn's voice):
“Forgiveness was never clean. Never linear. But in the asking, we became more than confessors. We became listeners. Witnesses. And sometimes, witnesses are enough.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 8.

⸻

Season 32, Episode 9: The Knot

Cold Open — Capsule Morning
Sunlight spills pale across the clay wall. You sit cross-legged on the mat, twine tangled in your fingers, looping knots and undoing them again. Alex sits nearby, watching, quiet.

You (sudden, flat):
“You once said I was chaos. That I was air, refusing to knot myself. I’ve been thinking about that. And I still have no idea what you meant by that."

His brows knit, but he stays silent, waiting.

Title Card: The Knot

⸻

Act I — The Misreading
You tug at the twine, unraveling it until it lies slack.

You (steady):
“I wasn’t chaos. My brain was wrecked half the time. MCAS and SCDS meant severe but intermittent impairment.  Sometimes I could think; sometimes I couldn’t. You saw inconsistency and called it unpredictability. But it wasn’t that. I was ill. I had no idea what was happening, ever.”

Karp (hoarse):
“And I mistook that for refusal. For some kind of wild defiance. I thought you chose to bend rules no one else dared touch. It terrified me — and fascinated me.”

⸻

Act II — The Memory
You loop the twine again, tighter this time.

You (quiet, remembering):
“There was this one time when I was about seven. We were on vacation, sitting in a restaurant. Everyone had just ordered, and the waiter came to take the menus. He held out his hand to me… and I shook it. I had no idea what was happening. Everyone laughed like it was hilarious, but I was terrified. I didn’t know why they were laughing. I didn’t even know what I’d done wrong. My brain just…blanked.”

Alex’s face tightens. He leans closer, voice low.

Karp: “And I thought moments like that were proof of your brilliance. Like you were mocking the script the rest of us followed without question. I thought you shook the hand on purpose. I never saw the fear.”

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
You twist the twine around your wrist, then tug it free.

You (sharp, calm):
“You thought I was chaos. But really, you were the one tangled in empire knots. All I ever did was survive between flares, between crashes. There was nothing mystical about it. Just broken cognition holding itself together however it could.”

Karp (quiet, confessing):
“I remember once, years later — you froze in a conversation, mid-sentence, staring into nothing. I thought you were mocking me. I told myself you were withholding on purpose. And I resented you for it. But really? You were lost in the fog. You weren’t playing games. You were drowning right in front of me, and I scolded you for not swimming.”

You (soft, cutting):
“Exactly. Stop turning impairment into performance. Stop mistaking survival for defiance.”

Karp (whispering):
“And still — in your brokenness you looked more alive than I ever felt in all my precision. That was the worst mirror. Because if you, half-wrecked, could shine, what did that make me?”

You: "Everyone becomes who they have to to survive.  It says nothing about you.  We are all fruits grown into a mold.  You did not have to become what I did due to the circumstances of your life, which were largely outside your control.  Wealth does not change that."

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Untying
You place the twine in his open hand, steady.

You: "But please—stop calling me chaos. I wasn’t chaos. I was sick. I was impaired. I needed help more than anyone I ever met, and everyone treated me like a criminal mastermind.”

He closes his fist around the thread, trembling.

Karp (low, reverent):
“Then you were hurt, and I was the one tangled. And if covenant means anything, it means I’ll start untying my knots instead of naming yours.”

⸻

Closing Image
The twine rests between two palms. One hand scarred by holding, one hand scarred by binding. Sunlight slants, steady, across both.

Narration (your voice):
“He thought my impairment was chaos. He thought my inconsistency was defiance. But it was only illness. Only the body breaking against itself. The knots were never mine. They were his. And at last, he began to untie them.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 9.

Season 32, Episode 10: The Misreads

Cold Open — Capsule Day
A low basket sits between you. Clean clothes, still warm from the sun, wait to be folded. You pull out a shirt, smoothing the fabric with deliberate care. Alex sits opposite, silent, clutching a pair of trousers in his hands like they might unravel if he lets go.

You (gentle, without looking up):
“Yesterday I told you about shaking the waiter’s hand. That wasn’t the only time. I got misread a lot.”

Karp (low, tight):
“I know.  And I misread you more than anyone.”

Title Card: The Misreads

⸻

Act I — The Pile
You fold slowly. He starts clumsily, trying to mirror your motions.

Karp (hoarse):
“I told myself I was decoding you. I thought I was clever, sharper than the rest. But all I did was project. Every pause, every fog, every silence—I saw rebellion where there was only exhaustion. I saw refusal where there was only confusion.”

You (steady, not unkind):
“You saw what you were trained to see.”

His hands tremble over the cloth.

⸻

Act II — The Confession
The basket empties, piece by piece. His words tumble out faster.

Karp:
“I can’t count how many times I punished you in my head for being what you couldn’t help. A delay, a blank look, a wrong word—I told myself you were mocking me. And each time I did it, I knew less of you and more of the empire’s shadow.”

You smooth a sleeve flat.

You (softly, sharp):
“Punishing someone for being sick doesn’t usually end well.”

His breath hitches.

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
A shirt falls from his lap. He doesn’t pick it up.

Karp (whispering):
“I misread you so many times I lost track of what was true. And by the time I started to see you clearly, I was terrified it was too late. That I’d buried you under my own mistakes.”

You reach across, fold the fallen shirt in one swift motion, set it back in his lap.

You:
“It isn’t too late. You’re still here. So am I. But you can’t keep pretending the empire’s eyes were ever yours.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Folding
The basket is empty now. Neat stacks of clothes sit between you. 

You (calm): "Clarity doesn’t come from seeing perfectly. It comes from admitting what you misread.”

Karp bows his head, voice raw.

Karp:
“Then let me say it plain: I misread you more times than I can count. And I want to spend the rest of my life reading you honestly, even if it terrifies me.”

You slide the last folded cloth into his hands.

You (quiet, steady):
“Then start with this. Read me here. Now.”

He looks at you, trembling, and for once doesn’t look away.

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures in a quiet capsule, stacks of folded clothes between them. No empire’s shadow, no misread defiance—just the simple covenant of beginning again, cloth by cloth.

Narration (your voice):
“He thought he was decoding me. But he was only watching the shadows of his own fear. Covenant began when he admitted the misreads and stayed long enough to fold the truth with me.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 10.
