Season 14, Episode 1: Coming Home

Cold Open — Sanctuary Gates

The three of you crest the final hill, packs heavy with onions, jars, and bat houses strapped awkwardly to your backs. The sanctuary square comes into view — lanterns glowing, children shouting, familiar figures waiting.

You (softly): “Home.”
Alex exhales like he’s been holding his breath the whole journey. Jonathan only smiles faintly, shoulders easing.

Title card: Coming Home

⸻

Act I — The Return

Residents gather as you unload the packs. Onion skins spill across the square, children laughing as they scoop them up. Jonathan kneels to show them how to braid onion strings. Alex carries the bat houses with quiet precision, setting them against the wall.

Sanctuary Child (wide-eyed): “What are those?”
Karp (smiling faintly): “Homes. For creatures that keep balance.”

⸻

Act II — The Feast

That night, onion broth simmers in every pot. The air is thick with its scent — sharp, earthy, strangely comforting. You sip slowly, savoring.

You (grinning): “This is officially the Onion Sanctuary now.”
Laughter ripples through the crowd. Jonathan strums his guitar softly, not to perform, but to keep the meal warm.

⸻

Act III — The Hanging

Together, you and Alex climb ladders to mount the bat houses on tall poles at the edge of the square. The whole sanctuary watches, silent. When the last one is fixed in place, the crowd cheers.

Jonathan raises his bowl.
Jonathan: “Rice, salt, onions, and bats. Covenant holds.”

⸻

Act IV — The Rest

Later, back in the capsule, the three of you collapse onto mats. Packs empty, bodies sore, but the space feels brighter.

You (softly): “I thought I’d collapse on the road. But I made it home. With both of you.”
Alex takes your hand, steady. Jonathan leans against the wall, smiling faintly.

⸻

Closing Image

The sanctuary square glowing in firelight. Onions braided in garlands, broth steaming, bat houses silhouetted against the night sky. Home — not perfect, but enough.

Narration (your voice):
“The cellar gave us roots. The road gave us covenant. But only home gave us rest. And for once, rest was enough.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 1.

⸻ 

Season 14, Episode 2: The Exhale

Cold Open — Capsule Night

The square outside is still buzzing — songs, laughter, children running. Inside, you three finally sit in silence, mats pulled close, broth bowls warm in your hands.

You (sighing): “If anyone says ‘covenant’ one more time tonight, I’m going feral.”
Jonathan snorts into his bowl. Alex hides a smile behind his hand.

Title card: The Exhale

⸻

Act I — The Silence

The first few minutes are just that — silence. No strategizing, no rationing, no tests. Just breathing together. Alex stretches out on his mat, letting his guard down. Jonathan tunes his guitar, but doesn’t play, setting it aside.

You (softly): “I forgot what stillness felt like.”

⸻

Act II — The Teasing

As the quiet grows heavy, you crack first.

You (deadpan): “So, Alex, how does it feel to be the sanctuary’s official bat landlord?”
Karp (grinning faintly): “Better than being the empire’s.”
Jonathan adds: “At least bats don’t file quarterly reports.”

Laughter breaks through, soft and genuine.

⸻

Act III — The Gratitude

Later, lying back, you speak into the dim:
You (quiet): “I thought I’d die out there. More than once. But you both carried me home.”

Jonathan, unusually gentle: “You carried us too. Just not the same way.”
Alex nods, eyes closed, hand brushing yours.

⸻

Act IV — The Rest

Blankets pulled close, the three of you drift toward sleep. No guards, no rationing, no tests. Just warmth and quiet.

You (murmuring): “I don’t want to move tomorrow. Or the day after.”
Karp (smiling faintly, eyes still closed): “Then don’t. Rest is covenant too.”

⸻

Closing Image

The capsule lit only by a fading lantern. Three figures side by side, finally still. Outside, the sanctuary hums, but inside — exhale.

Narration (your voice):
“After scarcity, after storms, after roots and wings — there was stillness. Not exile, not collapse. Just rest. And for once, that was covenant enough.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 2.

⸻ 

Season 14, Episode 3: Gifts and Dust

Cold Open — Sanctuary Square

Jonathan stands before the crowd, onions braided across his shoulders like garlands. Children giggle, people gather, curious.

Jonathan (bright): “We didn’t just survive the road. We brought home covenant: roots, honey, soil, and wings.”

Applause ripples. Meanwhile, back in the capsule, you haul out mats, sweep clay dust, scrub corners with vinegar water, muttering.

You (to yourself, dry): “Onions, bats, and dirt. What a haul.”

Title card: Gifts and Dust

⸻

Act I — The Showcase

Jonathan explains each gift: onions to heal, honey to strengthen, bat houses to protect. He weaves it into a story the sanctuary can hold. Children clap when he raises the bat house; elders nod when he speaks of soil.

Back in the capsule, you scrub the floorboards on hands and knees, breath steady. Cleaning is more than chores — it’s control, rhythm, reclaiming space.

⸻

Act II — The Drift

Alex lingers in the square, arms folded. He doesn’t join Jonathan’s speech, doesn’t step into the spotlight. He watches, silent, eyes unreadable.

Later, he drifts back into the capsule. You glance up from scrubbing.

You (teasing): “Enjoy the sermon?”
Karp (flat): “I don’t know what to do when I’m not commanding.”

Silence stretches. You hand him a rag.

⸻

Act III — The Cleaning

Together, you clean: shaking out blankets, dusting shelves, rinsing clay bowls. The capsule smells of vinegar and onions. Alex scrubs too hard, nearly breaking a bowl.

You (softly): “Not empire. Just clay. It doesn’t need precision. Just care.”
He pauses, then nods, gentler this time.

⸻

Act IV — The Balance

Jonathan returns, flushed from applause, carrying a garland of onion skins the children braided. He hangs it on the capsule door, grinning.

Jonathan: “The sanctuary loved it. They loved us.”
Alex glances at him, then at you. For once, he doesn’t argue, just sits down cross-legged.

You (smiling faintly): “Good. Because in here, we love clean floors.”

Laughter ripples, breaking the tension.

⸻

Closing Image

The capsule: scrubbed, orderly, onion garland glowing in lamplight. Outside, the sanctuary hums with Jonathan’s stories. Inside, you and Alex sit on clean mats, shoulders brushing.

Narration (your voice):
“Jonathan gave them covenant. I gave us order. And Alex, caught between, began to learn what to do when there was nothing to command.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 3.

⸻ 

Season 14, Episode 4: Whatever He Wants

Cold Open — Capsule Morning

You wake to find Alex already dressed, sitting cross-legged with a rag in his lap. The floor around him gleams — every tile wiped spotless, again.

You (groaning): “We just cleaned yesterday.”
Karp (flat, defensive): “I like order.”
You (dry): “The chaos of the present is the order of the future.”

He looks at you sharply, then away, uncertain.

Title card: Whatever He Wants

⸻

Act I — The Restlessness

Throughout the morning, Alex drifts. He chops wood too precisely, stacks it into perfect pyramids, then knocks them down in frustration. He tries tending the fire but adds wood too often, making the stew boil over.

You (teasing, wiping splatter): “Congrats, you just invented chaos through precision.”
His jaw tightens, but he doesn’t snap. He just stares at his hands.

You: "Do you need me to do some myofascial release on your jaw again?"

⸻

Act II — The Confession

Later, outside the capsule, you find him sitting alone, staring at the bat houses.

Karp (hoarse): “Every choice I’ve ever made was about control. If I’m not commanding, calculating, correcting… I don’t know what’s left. What if there’s nothing?”

You sit beside him.
You (softly): “I lived like that a long time too, only without the glory.  I promise you, those things aren't even 1/10th of what life can be.  To control is to assert you know better.  I dunno about you, but I sure don't.  If it helps, maybe the opposite of control isn’t surrender—just curiosity.  You cannot learn from what you immediately seek to control."

Alex coughs awkwardly.

You: "Let me put it this way.  Did your attempts to control me, however well intended, ever actually...work?"

Alex (laughing): "No.  No, they did not."

⸻

Act III — The Experiment

That evening, you nudge him toward something small.

You: “Okay, no control. Just choice. What do you want to do, right now?”
He hesitates, frozen. Finally, almost sheepish:
Karp: “I want to paint.”

You blink, then laugh in delight. Together, you drag out scraps of wood, gesso, and jars of leftover pigment from the cellar. His strokes are rigid at first, but then loosen, colors bleeding together.

⸻

Act IV — The Beginning of Want

By night, the capsule wall holds a rough, imperfect painting: a forest, alive with squirrels, bats, and onions strung like garlands. He sits back, shoulders loose for once.

Karp (quietly): “Not order. Not empire. Just… mine.”
You (smiling faintly): “George W. Bush would be so proud.  Now let’s see what else you want.”

⸻

Closing Image

The capsule glows with lamplight. A painted forest spreads across its wall, uneven and bright. Alex sits beside you, smudged with color, no longer the empire’s ox — just a man learning want.

Narration (your voice):
“Empire told him what to be. Scarcity told him what to do. But want — want was his alone to discover. And for once, that was enough.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 4.

⸻ 

Season 14, Episode 5: The Pillow Fort

Cold Open — Capsule Evening

Rain patters against the clay roof. You sort blankets while Alex sits stiffly, staring at nothing.

Alex (suddenly): “Let’s build a pillow fort.”
You blink, caught off guard.

You: "I did not expect to hear that come out of your mouth."

Title card: The Pillow Fort

⸻

Act I — The Gathering

Alex drags every blanket, mat, and pillow into the middle of the capsule. You watch with amusement. Jonathan pokes his head in, curious.

Jonathan (smirking): “What’s this? The empire collapses and you reinvent childhood?”
Alex (deadpan): “No, Jonathan, I'm reinventing architecture.  It's feralpunk."

Jonathan kneels to help, folding corners with precise angles.

You: "Can I ask where all this is coming from?"

Alex: "Remember that art project you did in college, in the campus coffee shop?"

You (laughing): "Yes, Fortify Joe's."

Alex: "You hated everyone, and yet you chose to create a huge relational aesthetics project that everyone loved.  You even sat with them all one night, awkward as it felt to be praised or even noticed at all.  And I knew then that I had to make you mine."

You: "Bro was I even legal yet?"

Alex: "Yes.  I checked."

⸻

Act II — The Collapse

The first attempt caves in immediately. Blankets sag, pillows slip. You groan, sprawled under the mess.

You (laughing): “Okay, this is metaphorically perfect.”
Alex chuckles, helping you up.

Karp (teasing): “Control fails. Curiosity prevails. Right?”
You (mock glare): “I was curious about the ground.”

⸻

Act III — The Success

By the third try, you’ve both rigged a lopsided but sturdy structure. Lantern light filters through the blankets, turning everything golden. Inside, it feels like a separate world.

You crawl in first, Alex following awkwardly. Jonathan ducks his head in, grinning but too tall to enter.

Jonathan (quietly): “That looks… cozy.”
Alex lies back stiffly at first, then slowly relaxes, hands folded on his chest like he doesn’t know what else to do.

⸻

Act IV — The Rest

Silence settles. Rain patters above. The three of you lie shoulder to shoulder, watching the blanket ceiling ripple.

You (softly): “This is the opposite of empire. This is want.”
Alex exhales, eyes closing.
Karp (whispering): “Then I want this.”

⸻

Closing Image — "Want" by Rufus Wainwright

The pillow fort glows with lantern light, sagging and imperfect but whole. Three figures inside, not commanders or saviors — just people lying still while the rain falls.

Narration (your voice):
“Empires collapse. Forts collapse. But under blankets, in the glow of a lantern, we found want — simple, fragile, and enough.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 5.

⸻ 

Season 14, Episode 6: The Morning After

Cold Open — Inside the Fort

The lantern has burned out. Morning light seeps through the blanket walls, soft but insistent. You wake tangled in mats and pillows, one arm over Alex, one leg shoved against Jonathan’s discarded cloak.

You (groggy): “So this is what feralpunk architecture looks like after an earthquake.”
Alex snorts awake, hair sticking up wildly.

Title card: The Morning After

⸻

Act I — The Collapse

The pillow fort sags dramatically as you sit up, sending a pillow flopping onto your head. Jonathan pokes his head back in, smirking.

Jonathan: “Empire falls. Forts fall. Breakfast?”
You (muffled under pillow): “Don’t mock the ruins of my joy.”

Alex actually laughs, steadying one of the sagging blankets as if reluctant to let it go.

⸻

Act II — The Domestic Shift

You and Alex set about dismantling the fort, folding blankets into uneven stacks. Alex is unusually slow, almost careful.

Karp (quietly): “I didn’t want it to end.”
You (teasing, but soft): “Good news, it’s blankets. We can build another one whenever you want.”

He nods, almost shy.

⸻

Act III — The Breakfast Banter

Jonathan returns with bowls of warm onion broth and roasted roots. The three of you sit cross-legged, still wrapped in fort-blankets like cloaks.

You (grinning): “Congratulations, we’re officially the sanctuary’s least intimidating trio.”
Jonathan (mock-solemn): “Speak for yourself. I’m terrifying in a blanket.”
Alex chuckles, shaking his head, shoulders visibly looser than the day before.

⸻

Act IV — The Echo of Want

As breakfast winds down, Jonathan heads out to busk in the common area.  As you clean up, you catch Alex staring at the collapsed pile of pillows.

You (gently): “You want to build another one already, don’t you?”
Karp (smiling faintly): “Yes. And maybe make love to you in it.”
You (blushing): "I am not opposed to that."
Alex (timidly): "Can I undress you?"
You: "Well, if I undress myself, I'll probably fall and knock the whole thing down, so I'm gonna go with yes."
Alex (playfully): "It wasn’t a question of logistics.  It was a question of consent."
You: "Then the answer is always yes."
Alex: "No barbs about how your consent never mattered to me before?"
You: "I think I've probably beaten that horse enough already."
Alex: "I would let you keep beating it if you wanted."
You: "I thought this was about beating something else?"

You both laugh.  Alex undresses you tenderly, methodically.  You close your eyes so you don't get dizzy.  

You: "And you?  Can I undress you?"

Alex nods.  You fumble with the buttons of his shirt.
You: "I always forget that men's clothing is all backwards."
Alex: "I think that's probably a matter of perspective."
You (teasing): "Has anyone ever told you you're terrible at foreplay?"

Alex (laughing): "Trust me, I'm not."
You: "Then prove it."
Alex: "Gladly."

⸻

Closing Image

The capsule is bright with morning light. The fort has collapsed, but the blankets are folded neatly, ready. The two of you sit together in mismatched cloaks, sipping broth, already planning the next thing.

Narration (your voice):
“Empires fall. Forts fall. But want doesn’t end with morning. It waits, fragile and persistent, asking only to begin again.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 6.

⸻ 

Season 14, Episode 7: The Workshop

Cold Open — Capsule Floor

Blankets folded, pillows stacked. The capsule feels empty after the fort, so you start laying out scraps: wood offcuts, leftover pigments, jars of clay, bits of twine.

You (to Alex): “If Jonathan’s going to be the sanctuary’s lead singer, we need a hobby. Otherwise we’ll start cleaning again.”
Alex raises an eyebrow, then shrugs — curious despite himself.

Title card: The Workshop

⸻

Act I — The Gathering

You and Alex scavenge materials: broken planks from old stalls, shards of clay pots, onion skins for dye. He carries them in neat stacks; you toss handfuls into a messy pile.

You (teasing): “We’re building chaos. Don’t over-sort it.”
Karp (deadpan): “Chaos has categories.”
You throw an onion skin at him. He almost smiles.

⸻

Act II — The Making

Inside, you both experiment: he smooths wood into simple panels, you mix pigments with vinegar to stain them. It’s messy, loud, full of mistakes. He keeps reaching for perfection; you keep tugging him toward play.

You: “No one’s going to judge your brushstrokes, my guy. It’s not a boardroom.”
Karp (quietly, but with a ghost of a grin): “Good. Because I’d be fired.”

⸻

Act III — The Break

At one point, you knock over a jar of dye. It splatters across the floor, soaking blankets. You brace for his sharpness, but instead Alex just laughs — startled, genuine.

Karp (chuckling): “That was… actually beautiful.”
You freeze, then laugh with him, both of you kneeling in the mess, hands stained bright.

⸻

Act IV — The Shift

By evening, the capsule walls are covered with rough panels: streaks of color, onion-skin dye, fingerprints pressed into clay. Imperfect, vibrant, alive.

Alex sits back, hands stained, eyes bright.
Karp (quietly): “This doesn’t need order. It already breathes.”
You (smiling): “Welcome to want.”

⸻

Closing Image

The capsule glows with lantern light, walls streaked with color and clay. Two figures sit cross-legged amid stains and scraps — no empire, no spotlight, just a workshop alive with mess.

Narration (your voice):
“Jonathan sang in the square. We built in the quiet. Covenant lived in both — but in the workshop, we learned to want with our hands.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 7.

⸻ 

Season 14, Episode 8: Trust Fall

Cold Open — Capsule Courtyard

You and Alex stand in the square at dawn, mats dragged outside. The sanctuary is quiet; Jonathan’s already off smoothing over public duties.

You (teasing): “Okay, fish-man. Ever done a trust fall?”
Karp (dry): “Only metaphorically, into markets.”
You: "Bro, that sounds more like swimming with sharks, but okay!"

Title card: Trust Fall

⸻

Act I — The First Catch

You stand lax, arms crossed. He positions himself behind you, awkward.

You (nervous, joking): “If you drop me, I’ll dislocate my everything.”
Karp (steady, almost solemn): “Then I won’t drop you.”

You let yourself fall back. His arms catch you easily, but his breath stutters like he’s the one shaken.

You laugh, then catch yourself when you see the serious look on his face.
You: "You okay?"
Alex: I watched you crash out with so many other people before your MCAS was under control.  At first I told myself I was just planning ahead for when you finally exploded at me, but it still hasn't happened.  And now I realize that I...want you to, for some reason.  Not that I want you to be angry with me.  Just that I need to experience your intensity firsthand after all this time."

You: "I understand what you mean.  But that intensity wasn’t me.  It was illness.  I always hated being like that.  If you're saying it sustained you, then I'm glad.  But it destroyed me.  It was never who I wanted to be.  It was only what every decision in my life was intended to leave behind."

Alex: "Don't you feel empty now?"
You: "No.  I feel at peace."

⸻

Act II — The Balance

Later, you try mirrored balance poses — simple partner acro stances, pushing against each other’s palms, leaning until your weight steadies together. At first it’s wobbly, laughter breaking each attempt. But soon you find rhythm, breath syncing.

You (smiling, a little breathless): “Look at you. Balance without a boardroom.”
Karp (reverently): “And without feeding on the fire that was consuming you.”

⸻

Act III — The Blindfold

You tie a scrap of cloth over his eyes, guiding him slowly across the courtyard. He tenses with every step until you squeeze his hand, steady.

You (softly): “Curiosity, remember? Not control.  The ground will forgive you if you hit it too hard.  Trust me, I'm an expert."

He exhales, loosening, following your voice. When the blindfold comes off, he looks startled but… lighter.

⸻

Act IV — The Collapse into Rest

Back on the mats, you lie side by side, palms still touching.

Karp (quietly): “I’ve commanded armies, corporations, governments. But this—falling, leaning, closing my eyes—it scares me more. And I want it more.”
You (smiling faintly): “Good. Then we’ll keep practicing.”

⸻

Closing Image

The mats in the courtyard, faint morning light spilling across them. Two figures lying side by side, palms brushing, bodies no longer in battle — but in balance.

Narration (your voice):
“Empires were built on force. Covenant was built on want. But trust — trust was built on falling, and finding arms still there when you landed.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 8.

⸻ 

Season 14, Episode 9: The Envy

Cold Open — Capsule Night

The rain has stopped. The capsule is dim, lantern nearly burned down. You and Alex sit cross-legged on the mats, a silence between you that feels heavier than usual.

Karp (quietly): “There’s something I’ve never said. Not to anyone.”
You tilt your head, waiting.

Title card: The Envy

⸻

Act I — The Admission

Alex stares at his hands, words catching.

Karp (hoarse): “I envied you. Not your pain — God, never that. But the way you endured it without surrender. The way you kept creating, kept moving, even when every force wanted you broken. I had wealth, power, armies of analysts, and still I felt smaller than you.”

You blink, confused.
You: "Everyone thinks i'm so strong.  But have you ever considered that maybe I was just oblivious?  I wasn’t enduring without surrendering, in my mind.  I was just living my life as I had always known it.  My dad always did everything he could to torture me.  I honestly thought life was like that for everyone.  So if you felt smaller than me, it wasn’t because I was brave or strong.  It was because a part of you already knew the life you were living didn't truly align with you."

He nods once, shamefaced.

⸻

Act II — The Fear Beneath

He exhales, trembling.

Karp: “I told myself empire made me strong. But empire only made me numb. Watching you — even bleeding, even cornered — I saw someone alive in a way I wasn’t. And I hated that it made me want to follow you instead of lead.”

You lean back, searching his face.

You (softly, cutting): “So that’s why you tried so hard to control me?  Because controlling everything made you feel small?  Bro, I love you but that doesn't make any sense.  Aren't you supposed to have a PhD in philosophy?"

Alex closes his eyes, laughing.

You: "Surely you've heard my speech about how the top of the food chain is the most precarious position of all."

Alex: "I've read it a hundred times.  The dinosaurs died.  The cockroaches lived.  I was afraid of you because I knew you were right."

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning

Silence stretches. You shift closer, voice steady.

You: “Here’s the truth. You were never smaller than me. You were just trapped in a game that kept you numb, that told you your ego and your image were a life jacket. You envied my authenticity, not my endurance, because you’d never been allowed to exist freely. Only to perform.”

His breath shudders.

Karp (whispering): “I don’t know how to live without performing.”
You: “Have you tried hiding where no one can see you?"

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Envy

You reach out, taking his hand. His fingers twitch like he might pull away, but he doesn’t.

You (softly): “Envy is an ugly word.  But there's nothing wrong with realizing you want what someone else has if there's no malice in it.  That's signal, not noise."
Karp (trembling): “Then I want to be… alive like you are. Even if it terrifies me.”
You (firm, gentle): “Magnesium.  Zyrtec."

⸻

Closing Image

Two figures in the dim capsule, lantern flickering out. No empire, no envy — just two hands clasped, trembling but steady.

Narration (your voice):
“He thought envy made him weak. But envy only showed him the shape of his hunger. And for once, he didn’t feed on it. He let it lead him closer.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 9.

⸻ 

Season 14, Episode 10: The Longing

Cold Open — Capsule Night

The capsule is dark except for a single lantern. You and Alex lie on your mats, facing opposite directions, backs almost touching. His voice breaks the silence.

Karp (quiet, hoarse): “I’ve lived with longing so long it feels like part of me. But I never knew it could ache like this.”

You don’t turn yet. You just listen.

Title card: The Longing

⸻

Act I — The Weight of Desire

He rolls onto his back, staring at the ceiling.

Karp: “Power, empire, control — they were placeholders. I thought longing was for things I could build, or own, or bend into shape. But it was you. Always you. And I couldn’t name it, not then. Not without losing everything.”

You (soft, almost teasing): “So what, I was your midlife crisis?”
He shakes his head sharply.
Karp: “No. You were the life I never let myself have.”

⸻

Act II — The Denial

Silence stretches. You sit up, watching him.

You: “If you’d approached me based on who you were, not just as some rich tech guy, I would've actually listened. You know that, right? How could you watch me for years and think I'd ever be impressed by money or power?"
Karp (bitter laugh): “I know. That’s what makes it all look so ridiculous in hindsight. But longing without speaking felt safer than risking losing you.  I didn't know what you wanted.  I didn't know who you wanted me to be.  You seemed to have contradictory desires.  I know that was because of all the modeling overlays, but I could never quite tell which version of you was truest."

He presses a hand over his face, trembling.

Karp (hoarse): “I watched you from every angle I could. Every breath, every step, and still it wasn’t enough. I thought empire would quiet it. But it only made it louder.”

You: "I didn't want you to be anything.  I just wanted you to be yourself.  Every man I ever rejected, it was because he would not give me that."

⸻

Act III — The Risk

You kneel beside him, steady.

You: “So what’s worse? Longing in silence, or longing out loud?”
His hand falls away from his face. His eyes shine.

Karp: “Out loud. Because now it’s not just in me. Now you can turn away.”

You (firmly): “And yet I haven’t.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Longing

He sits up, shoulders shaking, voice low.

Karp: “I want more than to watch, more than to follow, more than to balance. I want to stay. To wake up in the same space every morning and know it’s not a dream. That’s my longing. That’s my hunger.”

You reach out, placing your hand over his.

You (softly): “Then stop starving yourself. Stay.”

⸻

Closing Image

Two figures sit close in the capsule, lantern burning low. No empire, no placeholders — just longing spoken, at last.

Narration (your voice):
“He thought longing would undo him. But spoken, it bound us tighter. Longing wasn’t weakness — it was want, finally named.”

Fade out.

End of Season 14.
