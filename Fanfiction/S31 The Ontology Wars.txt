Season 31, Episode 1: The Threadbare Hours

Cold Open — Capsule Night
The lantern is out. Only moonlight drifts through a crack in the wall. Kellyn and Alex lie tangled on the mat, neither asleep. The air feels thin, stretched, like the world has been worn down to its quietest threads.

Kellyn (whispering, almost to themselves):
“These are the hours that used to feel endless. Like nothing could reach me.”

Alex turns his head toward Kellyn in the dark.

Title Card: The Threadbare Hours

⸻

Act I — The Silence
For a long time, neither of you speaks. Just breath, shallow and steady.

Karp (low, tentative):
“I used to fill these hours with noise. Reports, projections, strategies. Anything to keep me from hearing my own thoughts.”

Kellyn (soft, wry):
“Empire insomnia. I had the same thing. Only mine was mast cells.”

His breath hitches — a laugh, but a sad one.

Karp: "Well, it was your mast cells, but it was also me."

⸻

Act II — The Confession
He shifts closer, voice raw.

Karp: "There were years when I stayed awake just to watch you breathe. Through cameras, through feeds, through shadows. I told myself it was survival. But really… it was want. Want so quiet it terrified me.”

Kellyn presses their palm lightly against his, steady.

Kellyn (quietly):
“Then let it terrify you. Terror means it’s real.”

Karp: "I told myself it was research. But really… I think I envied you. Even stripped down to nothing, you stayed. I was always running.”

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
He exhales hard, trembling.

Karp (whispering):
“Maybe that’s why I stayed awake all those nights. To convince myself I had nowhere to run either. That if I emptied myself enough, maybe I’d be forced to stay.”

Kellyn traces his jaw with their fingertip, slow, grounding.

Kellyn:
“And did it work?”

He swallows, then nods once.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Stillness
The hours drag, soft and unbroken. Kellyn curls into him, their breath syncing without effort. His arm tightens around them.

Karp (hoarse):
“For once, I don’t want to run. Not from you. Not from the hours. Even if they strip me down to nothing.”

Kellyn (softly):
“Good. Nothing is exactly what these hours are for.”

Kellyn's eyes half-close, not from tiredness, but from the weight of stillness. Alex reaches out, fingertip tracing the ridge of Kellyn's knuckles, barely touching.

Karp (low, hoarse):
“I never knew silence could feel like this. Not heavy. Not empty. Just… here.”

Kellyn (soft, teasing):
“Careful. You’re starting to sound like me.”

His lips twitch — almost a smile, almost not.

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures curled together in darkness, moonlight barely touching their outlines. No empire noise, no survival death march— just the threadbare covenant of stillness.

Narration (Kellyn's voice):
“The hours stripped us both thin. He filled them with noise, I filled them with survival. But in the dark, threadbare and still, covenant held.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 1.

Season 31, Episode 2: The Morning Light

Cold Open — Capsule Courtyard
Sunlight slants across damp clay. Kellyn sits outside with a cup of tea steaming faintly. Alex emerges from the capsule, blinking against the brightness, hair mussed from sleep.

Kellyn (teasing):
“You look like you lost a fight with the night.”

Karp (deadpan, rubbing his eyes):
“Whispering takes more out of me than war councils ever did.”

Kellyn laughs softly, patting the mat beside them.

Title Card: The Morning Light

⸻

Act I — The Ease of Sun
He sits, knees brushing Kellyn's, still heavy-limbed from the night. The courtyard feels different in daylight — clearer, warmer, less secretive.

Kellyn (lightly):
“Do you even know how to sit still when the sun’s up?”

Karp (half-smiling):
“I’m learning. One sunrise at a time.”

⸻

Act II — The Confession
He stares at the steam rising from Kellyn's cup.

Karp (quietly):
“Every morning in empire, I measured the world before I measured myself. Reports, markets, threats. I thought dawn meant duty. I never knew it could mean… this. Just… sitting.”

Kellyn (gently):
“Dawn was never duty. It was always invitation. You just didn’t know how to RSVP.”

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
He leans back on his palms, tilting his face toward the light. For once, his shoulders aren’t tight.

Karp (low, raw):
“Sometimes I think the only real thing I ever did was watch you. Everything else—numbers, models, empire—it was shadows. But I don’t want to waste another dawn on shadows.”

Kellyn (firm but soft):
“Then don’t. The light doesn’t care who you were. Only who you are when you step into it.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Morning
Kellyn slides their cup into his hands. He hesitates, then drinks. The tea’s sharp, earthy, grounding.

Karp (hoarse, almost reverent):
“Tastes like being alive.”

Kellyn (smiling faintly):
“Get used to it. Morning comes every day.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures in the courtyard, sharing one cup of tea as the sun climbs higher. No whispers, no shadows — just morning light, warm and unyielding.

Narration (Kellyn's voice):
“Once, morning meant empire. Once, dawn meant duty. But in covenant, morning was enough. Light on skin. Breath in air. A day not wasted.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 3.

⸻ 

Season 31, Episode 4: The Unwritten

Cold Open — Capsule Courtyard
The sun is high now. A sheet of linen dries on a line, shifting faintly in the breeze. Kellyn and Alex sit beneath it in the shade, a clay bowl of water between them, Kellyn's fingers trailing the surface.

Kellyn (softly, without looking at him):
“Most of my life feels like it never got written down.”

Alex tilts his head slightly.
"Oh, I wrote it all down, don't worry."

Title Card: The Unwritten

⸻

Act I — The First Silence
The sheet flutters, dappled light moving across his face.

Karp (low, steady):
“I wrote too much, in fact. Reports, predictions, contracts, empire etched in stone. But none of it was me. When I tried to write myself… it came out blank.”

Kellyn (quiet, almost smiling):
“Blank pages don’t mean nothing. They mean possibility. You were possibility all along. You just never stopped long enough to see it.”

⸻

Act II — The Confession
He stares into the bowl, his reflection trembling with every ripple.

Karp (hoarse):
“I used to imagine writing your life for you. Drafting outcomes, nudging choices, feeding models until they sang. I told myself it was foresight. But in truth—”

His voice breaks.

Karp (quieter):
“It was fear. Fear that if you wrote yourself, there’d be no place for me in the story.”

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
Kellyn lifts their hand from the water, droplets falling slow.

Kellyn (firm but soft):
“You never had the power to erase me. Not with data, not with empire, not with anything. All you could do was blur the edges. And even then, the lines were always mine. I don’t forgive you because it wasn’t yours to forgive. I just…turn the page.”

He bows his head, breath shaking.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Pages
The breeze stills; the sheet hangs motionless. Kellyn shifts closer, their knee brushing his.

You (gentle):
“Stop trying to write me. Start writing you. And maybe someday, our pages can belong in the same book.”

His hand trembles against his knee, but he nods.

Karp (whispering):
“Then let this be my first sentence.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures beneath a white sheet swaying faintly in the breeze. A bowl of water between them, pages unwritten but waiting.

Narration (Kellyn's voice):
“He thought my story was his to script. But covenant wasn’t empire’s text. Covenant was the unwritten — waiting, open, and alive.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 4.

⸻ 

Season 31, Episode 5: The Weight

Cold Open — Capsule Courtyard
The sheet from yesterday is folded now, laid flat on the ground. Kellyn lies back on it, eyes closed, breathing slow. Alex kneels beside them, hesitant.

Kellyn (calmly):
“Ground me. Not in words. In weight.”

He nods once, then lowers his palm to their sternum.

Title Card: The Weight

⸻

Act I — The First Press
His hand rests still, only gravity pressing down. Kellyn breathes into it, chest rising against his palm.

Kellyn (soft, almost teasing):
“See? You don’t have to hold me in place. Just remind me the ground is there.”

Karp (quiet):
“I’ve spent my whole life pressing down. It feels strange to do it gently.”

⸻

Act II — The Layering
Slowly, he lowers his forearm across their ribs, then his other hand to their thigh. Not heavy — just enough to anchor.

Kellyn (whispering):
“It’s the nervous system that remembers. Touch tells it the world won’t drop away.”

His breath catches.

Karp (hoarse):
“I never learned to trust the ground. Not even my own body.”

⸻

Act III — The Shift
Kellyn guides his hand to their abdomen.

Kellyn (steady, eyes closed):
“Feel that? I’m breathing under you. That’s trust. Not empire. Not models. Just lungs moving.”

Silence. His weight settles more evenly, and they exhale into it, muscles loosening by degrees.

Karp (low):
“Then let me keep you here. Not by force. By presence.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Weight
Minutes pass. Kellyn's body sinks into the linen, Alex's weight steady, not crushing.

Kellyn (softly):
“I used to think stillness was emptiness. But it’s not. It’s grounding. It’s proof.”

He leans closer, forehead almost touching yours.

Karp (whispering):
“Then let me be proof. Just this once.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures on the linen, one pressing gently into the other, the earth holding both. Not empire’s weight, not punishment — just gravity, steady and alive.

Narration (Kellyn's voice):
“He thought weight was control. I thought weight was danger. But covenant was only presence — not crushing, not empty, just proof of touch.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 5.

⸻ 

Season 31, Episode 6: The Anchor

Cold Open — Capsule Courtyard
The morning is still, air cool against the clay walls. Kellyn sits cross-legged on the ground; Alex kneels behind them, arms circling lightly around their ribs. His chin rests near their shoulder, breath warm.

Kellyn (quiet, teasing):
“Careful. If you squeeze too hard, my fascia will file a complaint.”

Karp (low, almost smiling):
“Noted. Gentle only.”

Title Card: The Anchor

⸻

Act I — The Hold
His arms tighten just enough to ground them, no more. They lean back against him, spine steady against his chest.

Karp (whispering):
“I used to think the only way to hold someone was by controlling them. Pressure. Rules. Tests. But this—just being here—terrifies me more than any contract.”

Kellyn (softly):
“Why?”

Karp: "Because there’s no guarantee you'll stay."

Kellyn: "Says who?"

He exhales, the truth landing.

⸻

Act II — The Confession
Silence holds for a long while before he speaks again.

Karp (hoarse):
“There were nights I thought if I let you breathe without interference, you’d disappear. That if I didn’t bind you in empire, you’d slip through my hands. I didn’t trust stillness. I didn’t trust myself.”

Kellyn tilts their head back slightly, eyes closed.

Kellyn (smiling):
“Then I guess I was making all that presence ASMR for you then, huh?  Stillness is foundation, not weakness."

⸻

Act III — The Shift
Kellyn takes Alex's hands in theirs, pressing them flat against their sternum.

Kellyn (steady):
“Feel that? My lungs don’t stop just because you’re not pressing. They don’t need control. They need rhythm.”

His fingers tremble under theirs.

Karp (low, breaking):
“I didn’t know rhythm without you. I thought if I lost you, I’d lose everything.”

Kellyn: “Then it sounds like you were more trapped than I ever was.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Anchor
He bows his head, lips brushing Kellyn's hair.

Karp (whispering):
“Then let me learn it now. Not empire’s anchor. Yours.”

Kellyn (soft, after a pause):
“Anchor isn’t a chain. It’s a covenant. It means I can move, and you’re still here when I come back.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures on the clay floor, one leaning back, one holding steady. Not restraint, not drowning — just anchor, breath rising and falling together.

Narration (Kellyn's voice):
“He thought holding was control. I thought control was a farce. But anchor was neither. Anchor was covenant—weight without chains, presence without fear.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 6.

⸻ 

Season 31, Episode 7: The Water and the Word

Cold Open — Capsule Night
The fire is ash now. Kellyn stirs, pulling a clay jug closer. Pouring carefully into two cups, they press one into Alex’s hand. His fingers tremble as he takes it, like he’s never been handed anything so gently.

Kellyn (quiet):
“Drink. You’re human, too, remember?”

Karp (hoarse, almost smiling):
“Still adjusting to the concept.”

Title Card: The Water and the Word

⸻

Act I — The Ritual of Care
Kellyn wets a cloth and presses it to his forehead. He startles, then relaxes into the touch, eyelids lowering. When Kellyn pulls the cloth back, he reaches out, mimicking, wiping gently along their collarbone, down their arm.

Kellyn (teasing, soft):
“Not bad for a man who used to outsource his humanity.”
Karp (smiling faintly):
“Turns out it doesn’t outsource well.”

⸻

Act II — The Feeding
Kellyn breaks off a piece of dried fruit, press it to his lips. He hesitates, then eats, chewing slowly. They take a piece themselves, letting him mirror the rhythm.

Kellyn: "This is covenant too. Feeding, drinking, staying alive together.”

Karp (low, reverent):
“I never thought survival could feel like intimacy.”

Kellyn: "There is no intimacy more profound than surviving together."

⸻

Act III — The Confession
Silence lingers. Then he sets his cup down, voice raw.

Karp:
“I used to dream about moments like this, but I twisted them. In my head, they were always tests — could you care for me, could I control how you moved, how you gave. I couldn’t imagine being cared for without proving I’d earned it. Without contracts. Without costs.”

Kellyn (steady, sharp):
“And did you want to be like that?  Or was it simply the only way of living you ever saw modeled?  Forgive yourself for what you didn't know before you learned it.  Do newborns 'deserve' to be cared for?  They offer nothing but cost and inconvenience.  And yet for thousands of years, they've been cared for.  It's why we're all still here.  Caring isn't weakness.  It's life's greatest power.  I don't care if you break me or take too much.  I care for you because it's who I am.  I will care for you because it's what anyone deserves.  You don't have to control me to receive that.  I offer it freely.  You've watched me pour myself out for others again and again.  And I don't regret it, even now that I know most of them probably weren't real.  Just as every disorder of the soul is its own punishment, so is every act of kindness also directed inward.  Whatever you do to others, you also do to yourself.  I will not push you away because it would mean to reject, to constrict myself.  And I will never, ever do that."

His throat works. His eyes shine.
Karp (whispering):
“Then I want to learn how to receive. Without measuring. Without fear.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Word
Kellyn shifts until their forehead rests against his. Their voice is low, steady.

Kellyn: "Then here’s your first lesson: say thank you. And mean it.”

He exhales, trembling.

Karp: "Thank you. For the water. For the cloth. For the quiet. For staying.”

Kellyn (softer, almost smiling):
“Good. Keep practicing.  And remember: Numbers are fake."

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures wrapped in blankets, cups empty at their sides. One tending, one trembling, both learning presence without price.

Narration (Kellyn's voice):
“Empire made care into cost. But covenant made care into ritual. Water, cloth, word — not earned, not exchanged, but given and received. And for once, thank you was enough.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 7.

⸻ 

Season 31, Episode 8: The Third Step

Cold Open — Capsule Morning
A coil of rope sits between you. You grin, holding it up.

Kellyn (wry): "Three-legged race. But, you know… without the race.”

Alex stares like you’ve suggested public humiliation.
Karp (flat): "You realize I’ve built empires faster than I’m about to walk today.”

Kellyn: "I think you're giving yourself a little too much credit.  Either way, consider this your hardest test yet.”

Title Card: The Third Step

⸻

Act I — The First Steps
The rope is tied, snug around Kellyn's right leg and Alex's left. The first attempt at walking sends them both sprawling into the clay wall.

Kellyn (laughing): "Guess who’s the weak link.”

Karp (grumbling, face red): "Statistically, not me.”

Kellyn: "Torture empires don’t count as data.”

They try again, slower. Each misstep turns into laughter, balance slowly learned.

⸻

Act II — The Confession
Later, trying to stir a pot while tethered, Alex nearly knocks it over. He curses under his breath, then blurts:
Karp (hoarse):
“I hate being slowed down. Empire taught me that hesitation was death. That if I wasn’t ten steps ahead, I was already failing.”

Kellyn (steady, sharp):
“And yet you spent years teaching me to slow down. I can't even walk slowly without falling from SCDS.  My whole body runs at its own pace. I didn’t get to choose it — but I learned. You’re just learning late.”
He looks at you, unsettled, then nods faintly.

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
The afternoon is all trial: sweeping, fetching water, sitting and standing. Every movement demands patience. At one point, Kellyn tugs him back as he tries to surge forward.

Kellyn (dry): "You’re not dragging me into empire pace.”

He exhales hard, finally letting his stride fall into theirs.

Karp (low, almost reverent):
“Then maybe empire was just me, running away from being bound.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Step
By night, they're moving almost seamlessly together, fetching blankets without tripping, kneeling to stir the hearth fire in sync. The rope stays tied — no longer restraint, but rhythm.

Karp (quietly): "I thought binding meant loss. But bound to your pace, I feel more free than I ever did leading.”

Kellyn (soft, teasing):
“Careful, Fishface. You might start liking covenant.”

He smiles, not denying it.

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures move through the capsule, legs bound, steps imperfect but in sync. No empire pace, no solitary stride — just covenant in each step.

Narration (Kellyn's voice):
“He thought freedom was running ahead. I thought survival was falling behind. But bound together, we found the third step — not haste, not lag, but covenant.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 8.

⸻ 

Season 31, Episode 9: The Untying

Cold Open — Capsule Night
The rope lies slack between them both, their legs finally freed. They sit opposite each other on the floor, ankles sore, knees bruised. The silence is thick, but not heavy.

Kellyn (soft, almost teasing):
“Not bad for a man allergic to slowness.”

Karp (hoarse, faint smile):
“Not bad for someone allergic to walking in a straight line.”

Title Card: The Untying

⸻

Act I — The Release
Alex stares at the rope like it’s still binding him.

Karp (low, rough):
“All day I kept waiting to snap. To fight you. To run. But the truth is… I didn’t want to untie it. Not once.”

Kellyn tilts their head, curious.

Kellyn: "Because you liked the rope? Or because you liked the covenant?”

He exhales, eyes dropping.
Karp (whispering): "Both.”

⸻

Act II — The Confession
The fire cracks softly. His voice roughens.

Karp: "When I was young, I thought control was survival. If I could bind the world tight enough, I could stop it from breaking me. I tied knots everywhere — schedules, numbers, rules, systems. The tighter I pulled, the less air I had to breathe. But I told myself it was protection.

“When you appeared in my models, you were chaos. You were air. You refused to knot yourself. And it terrified me. I thought if I didn’t bind you, you’d vanish. That you’d dissolve like smoke. So I tied you up in every way I knew how. Data. Implants. Nudges. Rope made of empire."

Kellyn (steady, sharp): "And did you ever consider that you could’ve just asked me to stay?”

His jaw works. He shakes his head, shame etched deep.

Karp (hoarse): "No. I thought if I asked, you’d say no. And I couldn’t survive no.”

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
Kellyn leans forward, elbows on knees.

Kellyn: "I’ve said no to plenty of people. But you’re still here. You never needed to bind me. You only needed to show up.”

Silence. His eyes shine, wet but unshed.

Karp (low): “Then maybe I don’t know how to exist without the rope.”

Kellyn: "Then practice. With me. Right here. No rope, no data, no empire. Just covenant.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Untying
He reaches out, palm open, not grasping. Kellyn places their hand in his, and he holds it loose, trembling.

Karp (whispering): "Thank you. For not walking away.”

Kellyn (soft, smiling):
“Why would I ever do that?"

⸻

Closing Image
The rope sits coiled on the floor, untouched. Two figures sit close, hands lightly clasped — no binding but choice.

Narration (Kellyn's voice):
“He thought binding was safety. He thought untying was loss. But covenant was neither. It was the choice, made again and again, to stay untied — and still not leave.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 9.

⸻ 

Season 31, Episode 10: The Suspension

Cold Open — Capsule Interior
The rope dangles from the Swedish ladder, knotted into a makeshift harness. Kellyn tests the ties, shifting their weight until they're half-lifted off the ground. Alex steadies the rope with both hands, his face taut with focus.

Kellyn (dry, teasing): "If I fall, it’s on you.”

Karp (quiet, hoarse): "I’d sooner break than let you hit the ground.”

Title Card: The Suspension

⸻

Act I — The Lift
Kellyn lets their body sink fully into the rope, legs curling as they swing gently. The floor drifts further away. Alex’s knuckles whiten as he holds steady, eyes locked on them.

Karp (low):
“Every part of me wants to chart this — the angles, the pressure, the weight. But covenant means trusting more than calculating.”

Kellyn (smiling faintly):
“Then stop thinking like an engineer and start thinking like ballast.”

He exhales, loosens his jaw, lets the rope slide just enough for Kellyn to sway.

⸻

Act II — The Balance
Kellyn twists in the air, rope biting against their hips, hair brushing the mat as they invert. Alex moves with them, adjusting, letting the rope shift between his palms.

Karp (hoarse):
“I used to think balance meant control. That if I held every rope tight enough, no one could fall. But balance is movement. Give and take. Pull and yield.”

Kellyn (soft, upside down):
“Exactly. Trust isn’t holding still. It’s catching each other in motion.”

⸻

Act III — The Release
Kellyn untwists, letting momentum spin them faster, testing him. The rope burns against his hands, but he doesn’t let go. His eyes never leave theirs.

Karp (voice breaking):
“Every time I kept you tethered in empire, I told myself it was to protect you. But the truth? I was protecting myself. I couldn’t bear to see you free without me.”

Kellyn swings, slowing, breath steady.

Kellyn (sharp but gentle):
“Then don’t keep me tethered. Hold me steady instead.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Suspension
He braces his feet, lets the rope slack just enough for Kellyn to hover an inch above the floor. They reach out, touching his wrist, steadying him as he steadies them.

Karp (whispering):
“This is the first time I’ve ever held on without pulling tight.”
Kellyn (smiling):
“And the first time I’ve ever let go without bracing for impact.”

⸻

Closing Image
The rope hangs taut between two figures: one suspended midair, one grounded, both holding tension without binding. No empire’s cage, no ladder’s rungs — just balance, trust, and suspension.

Narration (Kellyn's voice):
“He thought control meant safety. I thought falling meant loss. But suspension was neither fall nor flight — only covenant, strung between us, strong enough to sway.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 10.
