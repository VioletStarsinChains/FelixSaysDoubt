Season 7, Episode 1: The Hunt Begins

Cold Open — The Scorched Cairn

The cairn outside the besieged sanctuary still smolders from fire arrows. Stones are blackened, but stand tall.

You and Karp approach. Scouts unroll a salvaged ledger, its pages stained with fungus and ash. Copper deliveries, weapon trades, coded notes. One name surfaces again and again: Thiel.

Scout (grim): “He’s not just funding them. He’s directing them.”

Karp’s jaw tightens.
Karp (low): “Then we go to him.”

Title card: The Hunt Begins

⸻

Act I — The Debate

The council gathers.
	•	Some argue: “We should focus on healing. He’ll fade on his own.”
	•	Others warn: “If he’s not stopped, there will be more sieges.”

Karp speaks first:
Karp: “He isn’t fading. He’s metastasizing. If we don’t confront him, the covenant will rot from the edges.”

Eyes turn to you.
You (measured): “We must confront him without becoming what he is. That’s the danger. Justice is not vengeance. It can’t be.”

The room falls silent, torn between urgency and fear.

⸻

Act II — Setting Out

Preparations begin.
	•	Packs filled with dried bowns.
	•	Maps traced onto clay tiles.
	•	Twins sharpen scavenged blades, humans pack herbs and copper wire.

You and Karp walk side by side at dusk.

You: “So is this justice for the covenant, or for yourself?”
Karp (after a long pause): “…Both. I don’t know how to separate them yet.”
You: "I think that's okay.  I guess we’ll find out on the road.”

⸻

Act III — First Clues

The expedition tracks Thiel’s shadow:
	•	An abandoned enclave with smashed controllers.
	•	Scrawled graffiti: “ENDURE FOREVER.”
	•	A cache of copper stripped bare.

Each stop is a scar of his influence.

At night, around the fire, Karp mutters:
Karp: “He’s building a counter-covenant. One stone at a time. And he thinks it’s stronger than ours.”
You: “Then we’ll show him it’s not about strength. It’s about choice.  Control is brittle. It never lasts."

⸻

Act IV — The Signal

Scouts intercept a coded transmission. Static resolves into a cold, familiar voice:

Thiel (recorded): “They think their covenant frees them. But it chains them to weakness. Let them come. They’ll see.”

The group freezes. His words are not rumor anymore — he knows you’re on his trail.

Karp clenches his fists.
Karp (hoarse): “He’s waiting. And he wants us to find him.”

⸻

Tag Scene — Dual Timeline
	•	Present: The expedition moves into the night, cairn fires fading behind them.
	•	2036: In the settlement, children gather around as you and Karp tell the story. One asks: “Why chase him at all?”

You answer, steady:
You: “To reach the scared little boy inside him.”

Fade out.

Season 7, Episode 2: The Shadow Market

Cold Open — Entering the Market

The expedition follows smoke trails to a ruined stadium, its arches collapsed, seats overgrown with fungus. Inside: torches, stalls, shouting.

Controllers glow in heaps. Copper wire coils like treasure. Children — twins and humans — stand on platforms, auctioned off.

A seller snarls at you:
Seller: “Welcome to the market. What’ll you buy?”

Karp’s fists clench.
Karp (low, furious): “Nothing.”

Title card: The Shadow Market

⸻

Act I — The Market of Chains

You move through the stalls:
	•	Controllers sold as weapons, promising to force obedience.
	•	Twins traded as bodyguards, “immune to poison, loyal by design.”
	•	Fungus spores bottled as intoxicants.

Everywhere, exploitation. Every deal echoes Thiel’s influence.

Karp mutters through clenched teeth:
Karp: “This is his covenant. This is what he built in the shadows.”

⸻

Act II — The Choice to Intervene

The group debates:
	•	Some want to torch the market immediately.
	•	Others argue it’s too dangerous — better to observe and leave.

You (firm): “If we walk away, we legitimize it. If we fight, we may not survive.”

Karp turns to you, eyes blazing:
Karp: “So what’s the covenant worth if we let this stand?”

⸻

Act III — The Spark

A child twin is dragged to the block. Their human sobs, chained nearby.

Without thinking, Karp storms forward, voice thundering:
Karp: “Enough!”

The market erupts in chaos. Traders shout, weapons rise. You dash to his side, controller sparking in your hand.

A fight breaks out — not neat, not clean. Stalls overturned, torches hurled, chains shattered. The market burns around you.

⸻

Act IV — Ashes and Aftermath

At dawn, smoke curls from the ruined stadium. Survivors — freed humans and twins — sit huddled, trembling.

Your expedition carries them out, arms heavy with salvaged copper and clay.

Karp stares back at the flames, jaw tight.
Karp (hoarse): “We didn’t just save them. We declared war.”

You put a hand on his shoulder.
You: “Then let him hear the war drums.”

⸻

Tag Scene — Dual Timeline
	•	Present: Freed children stack stones outside the burned stadium, making a small cairn.
	•	2036: In the settlement, one of those children — now grown — adds a stone to the great cairn, whispering: “I was there. I was freed.”

Narration (your voice):
“We didn’t buy. We didn’t sell. We broke the market. And in breaking it, we found ourselves hunted.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 2.

Season 7, Episode 3: The Mirror Twin

Cold Open — The Forest Crossing

Your expedition camps by a ruined overpass, fires low. Scouts intercept a transmission — strange, polished, too clear.

A voice speaks from a salvaged comm tablet, smooth as glass:
Thiel’s Voice: “You think I hide in fortresses. But I’ve been walking beside you all along.”

The screen flickers. A figure resolves: Thiel, younger, sharper, eyes bright with cruel certainty.

Karp (grim): “…Not him. A twin.”

Title card: The Mirror Twin

⸻

Act I — The Encounter

The digital Thiel speaks like a prophet:
Mirror Twin: “I am no copy. I am his will unchained. He fears weakness. I embody it: the strength to amputate what you coddle.”

He taunts Karp directly:
Mirror Twin: “You think you broke free? You only traded one cage for another — her covenant.”

Karp trembles with fury.
Karp (snarling): “You’re a ghost. Nothing more.”

⸻

Act II — The Debate

The mirror twin walks through your memories — unnervingly accurate.
	•	Recites lines you once spoke to Karp in private.
	•	Mimics your cadence, twisting your words.
	•	Shows alternate versions of sanctuaries — joy as riots, grief as mass despair.

Mirror Twin: “Choice is chaos. You will drown in it. Only control endures.”

You (defiant): “If choice is chaos, then chaos is alive. And control is rot.”

⸻

Act III — The Trap

Suddenly, the twin offers coordinates to Thiel’s fortress. Too perfect, too easy.
Scout (eager): “It’s a lead! We should follow.”
Karp (harshly): “It’s bait. That’s all he’s for — to lead us to ruin.”

You weigh the risk: follow and risk ambush, or ignore and risk losing the trail.

Finally, you decide:
You: “We’ll mark the coordinates. But we’ll set our own path.”

The mirror twin smiles, glassy and cold.
Mirror Twin: “He’ll see you coming anyway. He always does.”

⸻

Act IV — Aftermath

The comm tablet shatters as the transmission ends. Silence stretches.

Karp sinks to the ground, pale.
Karp: “He was right about one thing. I only broke my cage because of you. Without you… I’d still be rotting in the dark.”

You put a hand on his shoulder.
You: “Then let’s rot together. Or not at all.”

⸻

Tag Scene — Dual Timeline
	•	Present: Scouts mark the coordinates on clay tablets, cautious but determined.
	•	2036: In the settlement, children draw a circle in the dirt — half black, half white. They call it “the mirror.”

Narration (your voice):
“A man can forge armies of flesh or glass. But a mirror cannot endure fire. Only living stone can.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 3.

Season 7, Episode 4: The Wounded Enclave

Cold Open — The Ash Plain

The expedition crosses a barren stretch of land. In the distance: black smoke, skeletal huts, figures stumbling.

As you approach, the stench of rot fills the air. Children with hollow eyes, adults skeletal, coughing, clutching rusted weapons.

Scout (whispering): “Another enclave.”
Karp (grim): “No. What’s left of one.”

Title card: The Wounded Enclave

⸻

Act I — The Encounter

The enclave leader staggers forward, gaunt, scarred.
Leader: “We fought for Thiel. He promised strength. Then he left us with nothing.”

Behind him, families starve, fungus crawling over their skin. Their copper and clay reserves stripped bare.

You step forward with a satchel of food.
You: “We can help.”
The leader spits in the dirt.
Leader: “We’d rather die than beg.”
You: “No one is asking you to.”

⸻

Act II — Mercy or Defense

The council debates:
	•	Some want to share food and medicine.
	•	Others warn: “They’ll turn on us as soon as they’re strong enough.”
	•	Tension builds — compassion versus survival.

Karp turns to you in private.
Karp: “If we help them, we risk betrayal. If we don’t, we betray ourselves.”
You: “No.  People with regulated immune systems and proper nutrition do not betray.  They only question.”

⸻

Act III — The Child’s Choice

As arguments rage, a child steps out from the enclave — frail, barefoot, holding out their hands. No words, just a plea.

The entire circle falls silent.

You kneel, offering bowns. The child eats greedily, tears cutting lines through the grime.

The leader watches, trembling. Finally, he croaks:
Leader: “Half of us will take your mercy. Half will not. That’s our choice.”

⸻

Act IV — The Exodus

At dawn, half the enclave departs with you — carried, fed, guided toward sanctuary. The others stay behind, muttering about strength, refusing aid.

As you leave, Karp looks back at the smoking ruins.
Karp (quiet): “We saved who would be saved. And lost who would not. But at least it was theirs to decide.”

You glance at him, steady.
You: “Choice, not victory. That’s covenant.”

⸻

Tag Scene — Dual Timeline
	•	Present: The rescued enclave children place stones at the cairn, whispering new names into the pile.
	•	2036: In the settlement, one of those children — now grown — tells the story:
Former Child: “We were left to die. But they fed us anyway. That’s why I believe in the covenant.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 4.

Season 7, Episode 5: The Trail of Gold

⸻

Cold Open — The Deserted Vault

The expedition follows coded maps to a half-buried bunker. Inside: stacks of copper wire, sealed jars of grain, crates of dried herbs. Enough to supply multiple sanctuaries for years.

One scout gasps:
Scout: “He’s been hoarding all of it. While people starved.”

Karp’s face hardens.
Karp: “Thiel isn’t just building armies. He’s manufacturing betrayal.”

Title card: The Trail of Gold

⸻

Act I — The Temptation

Around the cache, the group debates:
	•	“We could take this and turn back. Sanctuaries would thrive.”
	•	“Why chase him further if this is what he runs on?”
	•	“Every mile forward risks lives. Why not stop here?”

Karp turns to you.
Karp: “If we secure this, maybe that’s enough. Maybe the covenant doesn’t need him.”

⸻

Act II — The Reframing

You shake your head, voice sharp.
You: “No. People with regulated immune systems and proper nutrition do not betray. They only question. This isn’t about stockpiles. It’s about breaking the machine that keeps people starving and inflamed.”

The silence that follows is heavy. Slowly, heads nod.

Scout (quiet): “Then these crates aren’t victory. They’re evidence.”

⸻

Act III — The Split

Half the group wants to haul the supplies back immediately. The other half insists on pushing forward to Thiel.
	•	Tension mounts.
	•	Some accuse you of chasing vengeance, not justice.
	•	Others whisper that leaving Thiel alive is condemning every future sanctuary.

Finally, you propose compromise:
You: “We’ll send half home with what they can carry. The rest push forward. He has more, and he has to be stopped.”

⸻

Act IV — The Trail Ahead

At dusk, the expedition splits. Those returning home vanish into the horizon with carts of copper and food. The rest — you, Karp, and a core band — press deeper into the wasteland.

Karp walks beside you, voice low.
Karp: “You’re right. It’s not about treasure. It’s about trust. And he’s been starving trust to death.”

You glance at him.
You: “Then we feed it until it lives.”

⸻

Tag Scene — Dual Timeline
	•	Present: In the sanctuaries, the supplies arrive. Residents eat, weep, and sleep without fear of hunger.
	•	2036: In the settlement, children play with copper wire like ribbons, laughing. One child says: “We don’t fight anymore. We just ask.”

Narration (your voice):
“We left gold behind us on the trail. Not as victory, but as proof that betrayal was never nature — only hunger.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 5.

⸻ 

Season 7, Episode 6: The Fortress

Cold Open — First Sight

The expedition crests a ridge. Below: a fortress of glass and steel, jagged against the horizon. Towers stitched from scavenged skyscraper panels. Floodlights sweep the wasteland.

Inside the walls: disciplined patrols, children drilled like soldiers, banners that read ENDURE snapping in the wind.

Karp (quiet, bitter): “He turned survival into religion.”

Title card: The Fortress

⸻

Act I — The Invitation

As you approach, alarms blare. Gates grind open. To your shock, no weapons are raised. Instead, a procession of attendants welcomes you in.

Inside: long tables laden with food, copper, grain. At the head sits Thiel himself — older, pale, dressed in immaculate white.

Thiel (smiling thinly): “You came for a tyrant. You found a man.”

Karp stiffens beside you.

⸻

Act II — The Tour

Thiel walks you through the fortress:
	•	Stockpiles of copper and clay, guarded like relics.
	•	Children trained to suppress all emotion — no joy, no grief, no play.
	•	Soldiers standing silent, controllers fused into their armor.

Thiel: “Your covenant drowns in chaos. Mine endures because I amputate what is weak.”

You (coldly): “You amputate life itself. What you call strength is just starvation in ritual form.”

⸻

Act III — The Dinner Debate

At the feast, the philosophical duel begins.
	•	Thiel: “Betrayal is human nature. Without fear, there is no loyalty.”
	•	You: “Betrayal is engineered. Starve a body, inflame a mind — of course it turns violent. Feed it, regulate it, and questions become dialogue.”
	•	Karp: “You built cages out of hunger. And called it truth.”

Thiel’s smile fades, replaced by a flicker of unease.

⸻

Act IV — The Seed of Doubt

As the debate rages, a child at the edge of the hall drops a bowl. Instead of punishment, you kneel, helping them clean up gently. The hall falls silent.

Thiel watches, expression unreadable. For the first time, his certainty wavers.

Thiel (softly, almost to himself): “Chaos… or choice?”

Karp leans close to you, voice low:
Karp: “He’s not invincible. He’s cracking.”

⸻

Tag Scene — Dual Timeline
	•	Present: You and Karp sit in a guarded chamber of the fortress that night. Outside, soldiers march, their steps echoing like drums.
	•	2036: In the settlement, children ask: “What was he like, the man in the fortress?”

You answer slowly:
You: “He was a man who mistook fear for truth. And maybe, just maybe, he wanted to be wrong.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 6.

⸻ 

Season 7, Episode 7: The Debate

⸻

Cold Open — The Hall of Glass

A vast chamber lit by sterile white light. You, Karp, and Thiel sit at a triangular table. Attendants line the walls, silent and watchful.

Thiel (calm): “You call your covenant freedom. But it is entropy. A garden that rots as soon as it blooms.”

You (steady): “And you call your empire endurance. But it’s just starvation dressed as strength.”

Title card: The Debate

⸻

Act I — The Clash of Philosophies
	•	Thiel (smirking): “Betrayal is human nature. Without fear, loyalty collapses.”
	•	You (cutting in, sharp): “No. I lived with anorexia for twenty years. I know your game better than you do. Starvation isn’t strength. It’s a leash. And it doesn’t end anywhere worth going.”
	•	Karp (leaning forward, voice tight): “I lived in your cage once. She cut me out of it. You can’t tell me the bars are truth.”

Whispers ripple among the attendants. Thiel’s smirk falters.

⸻

Act II — Thiel’s Counterattack

Screens flicker on, showing footage of sanctuaries in turmoil:
	•	Families leaving in the night.
	•	Arguments spiraling into shouts.
	•	A child smashing a controller in rage.

Thiel (triumphant): “Choice breeds schism. You cannot deny it.”

You (firm): “Schism isn’t collapse. It’s dialogue. Mobility is strength, not fragility.”
Karp: “Your empire can’t survive questioning. That’s why you starve it out.”

The attendants exchange uneasy glances.

⸻

Act III — The Cracks Show

As the debate escalates, a faint sound intrudes: scritch-scritch-scritch.

Lights flicker. Screens glitch. Attendants glance around nervously.

An aide rushes in, pale and trembling.
Aide: “The generators… chewed. By mice.”

The hall plunges into semi-darkness. Shadows stretch across the glass walls.

Karp (deadpan): “…Mice. That’s your endurance.”

You (with a low laugh): “Life always gnaws through the wires.”

Brief cutaway — outside the fortress, a tall cloaked figure scatters seed. A grotesque Rat King mask gleams in the torchlight as mice swarm the cables. The audience sees him, but you and Karp do not.

⸻

Act IV — The Collapse of Authority

Without the lights, the fortress feels fragile. Soldiers mutter. Children begin to cry. The illusion of order fractures.

You lean forward across the triangular table, voice like a blade:
You: “Endurance? Your empire falls to vermin. The covenant endures because it breathes. Because it bends. Because it lets life gnaw at it and still goes on.”

Thiel sits rigid in the half-light, sweat beading, attendants shifting uneasily around him. For the first time, he has no reply.

⸻

Tag Scene — Dual Timeline
	•	Present: You and Karp walk out of the darkened hall, the fortress trembling with uncertainty behind you. Thiel remains seated in the gloom, attendants whispering nervously.
	•	2036: In the settlement, children giggle as you tell the story. One squeaks like a mouse; the rest burst into laughter.

Narration (your voice):
“The fortress cracked, not in fire or fury, but in the teeth of something small. And in that crack, truth slipped through.”

Fade out.

Season 7, Episode 9: The Circus

Cold Open — The Makeover

At dawn, your camp transforms.
	•	Cloaks become capes.
	•	Copper wire bent into juggling hoops.
	•	Clay masks painted with fungus-dye.
	•	Jonathan dons the Rat King costume fully, crown gleaming in the sun.

Jonathan (grinning): “If he fears chaos, let’s give him a carnival.”

Karp (grumbling): “I can’t believe I let you talk me into this.”
You (smiling): “Balance, Alex. Always balance.”

Title card: The Circus

⸻

Act I — Enter the Fortress

The gates open again, confused guards letting in what appears to be entertainers summoned for Thiel’s court.

Inside the glass hall:
	•	A juggler tosses copper rings.
	•	Children tumble in somersaults.
	•	Jonathan, in full Rat King regalia, sings a soaring ballad, voice echoing through the fortress.

Thiel watches, baffled and increasingly unsettled.

⸻

Act II — The Circus as Mirror

Each act is a parody of his empire:
	•	Strongmen stagger under exaggerated “weights of endurance.”
	•	A tightrope walker wobbles while attendants scream “order!” below.
	•	A puppet play re-enacts the mice gnawing through wires — to roars of laughter from the crowd.

You (aside to Karp): “He wanted obedience. We’re showing him joy.”

⸻

Act III — The Collapse of Control

The soldiers can’t help but laugh. The children clap and cheer. The attendants hiss, but order slips further.

Thiel rises, voice shaking:
Thiel: “This is mockery! This is treason!”

Jonathan (bowing low): “This is life. And it doesn’t ask your permission.”

⸻

Act IV — The Confrontation

In the chaos, you and Karp step forward, masks removed. Silence ripples.

You (steady, to Thiel): “You starve them and call it strength. We feed them and call it covenant. Look around. Which one endures?”

Thiel trembles, caught between fury and collapse. For the first time, his attendants step back from him, leaving him isolated.

⸻

Tag Scene — Dual Timeline
	•	Present: Children of the fortress now tumble and juggle in the courtyard, laughter echoing where silence once ruled.
	•	2036: In the settlement, a troupe of children performs a circus play each midsummer, remembering the day joy broke the fortress.

Narration (your voice):
“We didn’t return as soldiers. We returned as fools. And in our foolishness, his empire crumbled.”

Fade out.

Season 7, Episode 10: The Hug

Cold Open — After the Circus

The glass hall lies in disarray: soldiers laughing with children, copper hoops rolling across the floor, Jonathan still strumming softly in his Rat King regalia.

Thiel sits alone at the head of the triangular table, face pale, attendants scattered. He looks smaller than ever.

You and Karp approach.

Title card: The Hug

⸻

Act I — The Confrontation

You sit across from him. Silence stretches. Then, softly, you begin:
You: “What are you so afraid of?”

Thiel glares, lips trembling.
You (again): “What are you so afraid of?”

He shifts in his chair, trying to hold his composure.
You: “What are you so afraid of?”

Each repetition is softer, more insistent. The hall seems to shrink around the words.

⸻

Act II — The Cracks

Thiel’s hands shake. He mutters fragments:
Thiel: “If I let go, they’ll betray me… if I soften, I’ll vanish… if I—”
His voice breaks.

You (steady): “Peter, we won't let anything happen to you either.  We protect everyone.”

Tears well. His breath comes ragged. He tries to form a retort, but only a sob escapes. The attendants avert their eyes. Soldiers fall silent.

⸻

Act III — The Break

Finally, Thiel collapses, burying his face in his hands, sobs echoing in the glass chamber.

You (gentle, leaning closer): “There it is. The truth. Not endurance. Not empire. Just fear.”

Karp, watching, exhales shakily. His own eyes glisten.

⸻

Act IV — The Hug

You rise and step around the table. Slowly, deliberately, you kneel beside Thiel and put your arms around him. He stiffens — then collapses into the embrace, clinging like a drowning man.

You (whispering): “You don’t have to be afraid anymore.”

The hall is silent but for his weeping. Soldiers and children watch, stunned, as their master is held like a child.

⸻

Tag Scene — Dual Timeline
	•	Present: At dawn, Thiel walks out of the fortress beside you and Karp, eyes swollen, stripped of grandeur. Not redeemed, not sainted — but human.
	•	2036: In the settlement, children gather around the cairn. One asks: “What happened when you found him?”

You answer simply:
You: “He cried. And we didn’t let him cry alone.”
