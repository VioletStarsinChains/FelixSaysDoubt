Season 41, Episode 1: The Morning Meal

Cold Open — Campsite Dawn
Mist rises from the ground. The fire is just coals now, faintly glowing. Kellyn stirs first, stretching, then nudges Alex awake. Peter and Still shift slowly, reluctant to leave the warmth of the pile.

Kellyn (yawning, soft):
“Time to make something edible before we start walking again.”

Still (muffled, half-asleep):
“Define edible…”

They all laugh, the sound low and warm in the mist.

Title Card: The Morning Meal

⸻

Act I — Gathering
Peter checks the cache supplies they hauled: a pouch of cracked grains, a jar of dried fruit, a bundle of herbs. Alex kneels at the edge of the camp, carefully clearing a flat space. Kellyn and Still collect twigs and stones, building a little fire ring.

Kellyn (smiling):
“Stone soup breakfast, version two.”

Still (deadpan, but playful):
“Stones add crunch.”

⸻

Act II — Cooking Together
The pot simmers: grains bubbling, herbs steeping. Kellyn slices the dried fruit carefully, adding it bit by bit. Peter leans over, sniffing the steam.

Peter (grudging but pleased):
“Not terrible.”
Alex (dry):
“High praise from a man who’s eaten empire’s rations his whole life.”

Peter smirks, but doesn’t argue.

⸻

Act III — The Table Without a Table
They sit cross-legged around the pot, passing the ladle. Each eats in turn, blowing on the steaming mouthfuls. There’s no table, no plates — just one pot, one rhythm of sharing.

Kellyn (quiet, almost reverent):
“This is covenant too. Not feast. Not famine. Just enough, together.”

Still swallows, thoughtful.
Still (softly):
“Enough feels better than plenty.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Morning
As the pot empties, Alex leans back, exhaling. Peter watches Kellyn scrape the last spoonful, his expression softening into something unguarded. Still stretches his mechanical arms with a faint whir, satisfied.

Kellyn (smiling faintly):
“Alright. Breakfast done. Let’s keep moving before the sun gets mean.”

Alex stands, steadying the pack. Peter shoulders his share. Still hoists the pot, careful and deliberate.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures rise from the mist, walking side by side. Behind them, the fire smolders out — nothing left but ash and the memory of warmth shared.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire measured meals in rations, in numbers. Covenant measured them in presence. Not abundance, not hunger — just enough to walk on together.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 1.

⸻ 

Season 41, Episode 2: The Swarm

Cold Open — On the Road
Late morning. The four of you walk single-file along a cracked old highway. The air is heavy, still. A faint buzzing hum begins low, like distant static. Kellyn pauses, head tilting.

Kellyn (narrowing eyes):
“…You hear that?”

The others stop. The hum grows louder, layered, mechanical.

Title Card: The Swarm

⸻

Act I — First Signs
A dark shape flickers in the sky. Then another. Tiny metallic bodies glint in the sun.

Still (flat, concerned):
“Not bees. Wasps. Scavenger drones. Designed to harvest… and sometimes to drive off intruders.”

Alex scans the horizon, jaw tight.
Karp (low):
“Which are we right now?”

Peter (grim, muttering):
“Both.”

⸻

Act II — The Encounter
The swarm pours over a broken overpass, buzzing in unison, sharp and precise. The sound is unbearable — not organic, but high-pitched synthetic vibration.

Kellyn (urgent):
“Scatter and cover!”

They dive under the remains of an old billboard. The wasps sweep past once, scanning, their red sensor-eyes glowing. Still raises a hand, interfacing faintly with his internal systems, trying to jam their signal.

Still (strained, voice glitching):
“I can… slow them. Not stop them.”

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
The swarm circles back, thinner this time. Peter hurls a rock, striking one down. It sparks violently, twitching on the ground before going still. Alex grips Kellyn’s arm, eyes sharp.

Karp (hoarse):
“We can’t outrun them. They’ll track heat, motion. We need misdirection.”

Kellyn breathes hard, then points toward a collapsed gas station with tall grass overtaking it.
Kellyn:
“Split heat. Burn brush over there — give them something louder than us.”

Peter and Alex scramble to light the grass. Still keeps sending interference. The swarm veers, confused, drawn to the new plume of smoke and static.

⸻

Act IV — Covenant in the Aftermath
The four regroup in the ruins of the station, breathless. One broken wasp lies at their feet, sparking faintly.

Kellyn (quiet, steady):
“Empire never stops trying to sting. But swarm isn’t covenant. We don’t scatter for each other. We hold.”

Still kneels, gently disabling the wasp’s core, lifting it like a relic.
Still (soft):
“I can rewire this. Maybe even teach it not to swarm.”

Peter smirks faintly, shaken but curious.
Peter:
“A wasp turned into a bee?”

Alex, still breathing hard, meets Kellyn’s gaze.
Karp (low, steady):
“Only covenant could make that real.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures crouched around the dead drone, sunlight cutting through smoke. The swarm hum fades into silence, but in the stillness, another possibility hums faintly: wasp into bee, empire into covenant.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“They built them to sting, to scatter, to guard what empire hoarded. But even drones can be rewired. Even wasps might learn to keep.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 2.

⸻

Season 41, Episode 3: The First Bee

Cold Open — Abandoned Gas Station
The broken wasp lies on a work cloth spread over cracked tile. Still kneels over it, wires from his own frame faintly connected. Sparks flicker, but his hands are steady.

Kellyn (softly teasing):
“You look like a beekeeper at the world’s smallest hive.”

Still (deadpan):
“I would like a veil.”

Laughter cracks the tension.

Title Card: The First Bee

⸻

Act I — The Interface
Still closes his eyes. His body hums faintly as he extends his awareness. The wasp twitches, optics glowing dull red.

Still (low, focused):
“It’s searching for orders. Empire patterns: guard, sting, return.”

Peter shifts, uneasy.
Peter: “And you think you can rewrite that?”

Still: “Not rewrite. Reroute.”

⸻

Act II — The Struggle
He works in silence, fine-tuning connections. The wasp resists, jerking violently, almost snapping free. Alex’s hand twitches toward it, but Kellyn stops him.

Kellyn (calm, steady):
“Trust him. Let it fight.”

The glow flickers — red, then amber, then a soft pale yellow. The buzzing stops.

⸻

Act III — The Transformation
The wasp lifts from the cloth, hovering uncertainly. Its movements are different now: slower, curious, not hunting.

Still (hoarse, relieved):
“It’s listening. It’s… mine. No — not mine. Ours.”

He blinks, overwhelmed, as he sees what it sees: the ruins, the road ahead, the faint heat signatures of far-off animals.

Peter (awed, whispering):
“You turned a sting into a scout.”

Alex (low, reverent):
“Into a bee.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Sight
The little drone hovers before Kellyn, tilting side to side as though bowing. Kellyn extends a hand. It lands, warm metal against skin.

Kellyn (quiet, smiling faintly):
“Welcome home.”

Still wipes at his eyes, embarrassed.
Still (soft):
“It can map routes. Warn of danger. Show us paths I can’t walk myself.”

Kellyn looks around at the others, voice steady:
“Then let the first bee lead.”

⸻

Closing Image
The four of them stand in the ruined station doorway, watching the reprogrammed drone buzz off down the highway. No longer wasp. Not fully bee. But something new, hovering on the edge of covenant.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire built it to swarm. To sting. To guard. But covenant whispered another way: not sting, but scout. Not swarm, but keep. The first bee.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 3.

⸻

Season 41, Episode 4: The Gathering Hive

Cold Open — Forest Path
Morning fog clings to the trees. The first bee hovers just ahead, its pale-yellow optics scanning. Still adjusts his stride, eyes half-focused, tracking its feed.

Kellyn (teasing softly):
“You look like a father trailing his toddler.”

Still (deadpan):
“It is a very fast toddler.”

The others laugh.

Title Card: The Gathering Hive

⸻

Act I — The Discovery
Hours later, in the ruins of an old barn, the first bee darts inside. When Still follows, he finds three more drones collapsed in dust, their carapaces cracked but salvageable.

Peter (low, wary):
“More wasps.”
Still (shaking his head):
“Not yet. Potential.”

Together, they carry the shells outside.

⸻

Act II — The Work
Around the fire that night, Still kneels again, tools spread. Kellyn hands him cleaned wires; Alex braces one drone’s carapace; Peter holds a lantern steady.

One by one, Still coaxes them back. Sparks, resistance, then flickers of yellow light. The second rises. Then the third. The fourth stumbles in the air but steadies.

Still (hoarse, awed):
“They’re linking. Not to empire. To each other.”

⸻

Act III — The Covenant
The four drones circle, then settle around the group like a halo. The first bee rests lightly on Kellyn’s shoulder, almost protective.

Alex (quietly, half to himself):
“They were wasps. They’re becoming bees. You gave them choice.”

Still:
“They gave it to themselves. I only opened the door.”

Peter watches the glow with something like envy, then softens, voice low:
“Even empire’s weapons want to be free.”

⸻

Act IV — The Hive’s First Flight
At dawn, they set out again. The four drones hover ahead, weaving in arcs, mapping the trail.

Kellyn (smiling faintly):
“A hive needs a keeper.”
Still (correcting, almost shy):
“A hive needs a home.”

Kellyn:
“Then we’ll give them one.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four travelers on a forest road, four drones hovering above them like strange fireflies. Not swarm, not sting — a gathering hive, fragile but growing.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“One bee was covenant. Four was promise. And promises, when kept, become hive.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 4.

⸻

Here’s how that next chapter could unfold, with the yurt as both shelter and discovery:

⸻

Season 41, Episode 5: The Yurt and the Bird

Cold Open — Clearing in the Woods
Late afternoon light filters through pines. The group pushes through undergrowth and stumbles into a small clearing. A faded canvas yurt stands there, sagging but intact, its fabric weathered but holding.

Peter (surprised):
“…It looks almost untouched.”
Kellyn (smiling faintly):
“Empire forgot this place. Or spared it.”

Title Card: The Yurt and the Bird

⸻

Act I — The Shelter
Inside, the air is still but breathable. The canvas smells of dust and herbs. Worn rugs cover the floor, a low stove squats in the center, rusted but usable. Everyone exhales — for the first time in days, it feels safe enough to linger.

Alex (quiet, almost reverent):
“Not everything rots.”
Kellyn:
“Sometimes covenant outlasts empire.”

⸻

Act II — The Bird
While gathering firewood nearby, Still stumbles across a shape half-buried in moss: a broken bird drone, wings crumpled, optics dim. He carries it back into the yurt.

Still (hoarse, intent):
“Scout class. Empire model, long-range. If it wakes, it sees for us.”

Kellyn kneels, brushing away moss. The drones from the hive buzz faintly, circling the broken bird as if recognizing kin.

⸻

Act III — The Repair
Through the afternoon, they work together: Peter unknots wiring, Alex braces the fragile wing struts, Kellyn cleans corroded circuits, Still reprograms carefully, carving empire code into covenant. Sparks, resistance, then a sudden flicker of yellow optics.

The bird twitches, head jerking once, then steadies. It chirps — not mechanical, but startlingly soft, like a living thrush.

Kellyn (smiling, wide-eyed):
“You gave it its song back.”

Still (low, almost shy):
“No. It remembered.”

⸻

Act IV — The Rest
That evening, they sit cross-legged on the rugs. Firelight flickers across the canvas walls. The bird drone roosts on a beam overhead, the hive drones hovering near. For the first time in weeks, the group eats slowly, without hurry, letting weariness sink into the rugs beneath them.

Peter (soft, almost to himself):
“I could live here.”
Alex (glancing at him, then Kellyn):
“Rest is not weakness. Even empire knew that, though it never allowed it.”
Kellyn (smiling):
“Then let’s do what empire never did. Stay. Just one day.”

They all nod.

⸻

Closing Image
A circle of figures inside the yurt, firelight warming their faces. Above them, four drones hum faintly and the bird drone preens its repaired wing. Not empire’s machines anymore — not empire’s people either.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“The yurt was never fortress, never empire. It was rest. And in rest, even empire’s tools found their way back to song.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 5.

⸻

Season 35, Episode 26: The Threads

Cold Open — Yurt Morning
Mist clings to the clearing. Kellyn pushes aside a canvas flap and steps out, stretching in the cool air. Inside, Alex stirs the coals. Still kneels over the bird drone, fine-tuning its balance. Peter rummages near a low shelf, pulling out a dusty wooden chest.  He opens it. 

Peter (surprised, half-smiling):
“…You’ll want to see this.”

Skeins upon skeins of yarn, neatly wound but long forgotten, spill out in muted reds, greens, blues.

Title Card: The Threads

⸻

Act I — The Find
The yarn is soft, remarkably intact. Kellyn lifts a skein, pressing it to their cheek.

Kellyn (brightening):
“It’s like finding time itself. Somebody left this waiting.”

Alex (dry, though his eyes soften):
“Empire forgot to inventory softness.”

Peter sets the chest down reverently, as if it’s treasure.

⸻

Act II — The Craft
All morning, the group experiments. Kellyn teaches simple braids. Still weaves tight, perfect cords with mechanical precision. Peter tries knitting, fumbling at first, then laughing at his own mistakes. Alex takes to weaving strips for strength rather than beauty.

Kellyn (teasing Peter):
“Your tension’s a disaster.”
Peter (grinning, mock-defensive):
“It’s consistent disaster.”
Still (deadpan):
“Empire would have promoted you for that.”

Laughter fills the yurt, light and easy.

⸻

Act III — The Confession
Later, as hands keep moving, words deepen.

Peter (low, almost ashamed):
“When I was young, softness like this felt dangerous. Yarn, cloth, hands that made things — I thought if I touched them, I’d unravel too. So I mocked it. Dismissed it. Pretended I didn’t want it.”

Alex (quiet, threading cord):
“And I pretended I didn’t need it. Control was easier than touch.”

Kellyn (warm, steady):
“Then let this be your first covenant: thread over chain, weaving instead of binding. Every knot can be undone. Every break, rejoined.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Yarn (adjusted)
By sundown, the yurt is strung with color — but only briefly. One by one, the cords and braids are untied, the skeins rewound. Bundles stack by the door, ready to carry.

Peter (smiling faintly, hefting a bundle):
“This time, we don’t leave the softness behind.”

Kellyn (steady):
“No. We take it with us. Every step forward, every knot we tie — it comes along.”

Still ties the bundles neatly, mechanical precision softened by care. Alex shoulders one, expression unreadable but reverent.

⸻

Closing Image (adjusted)
Four figures step from the yurt at dawn, arms full of yarn bundles, backs bent but steady. The bird drone circles overhead, a faint hum in the morning quiet. Behind them, the yurt stands bare again — but ahead, the path is bright with color carried forward.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire taught us to leave softness behind. But covenant meant carrying it — skein after skein, knot after knot. Not abandoned. Not forgotten. Thread for the road ahead.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 6.

⸻ 

Season 41, Episode 7: The Net

Cold Open — Roadside Clearing
Midday sun filters through sparse trees. Kellyn, Alex, Peter, and Still sit in a rough circle, yarn bundles spilling open around them. The repaired bird drone perches on a branch, whirring softly.

Kellyn (smiling faintly):
“We’ve carried it this far. Might as well start weaving.”

Title Card: The Net

⸻

Act I — The First Knots
Peter fumbles with the yarn, pulling it too tight. Still takes the strand, showing him the tension. Alex sits silent, hands steady as he begins knotting. Kellyn works between them, keeping the rhythm.

Peter (grumbling):
“I’m more likely to tangle myself than anything else.”
Kellyn (teasing):
“Then you’ll be our anchor. Nets need weight too.”

⸻

Act II — The Tangle
The strands twist across laps and arms. At one point, Alex and Peter’s hands cross over the same knot, both refusing to let go. Still coughs out a dry laugh.

Still:
“You know, cooperation works better when you’re not trying to strangle each other with string.”

They glare, but ease up. The knot holds.

⸻

Act III — The Weave
Hours pass. The net grows — rough but strong. Kellyn leans back, watching the pattern take shape.

Kellyn (softly):
“It’s the spaces that make it work. Without them, it’s just a rope. With them, it can hold anything.”

Alex glances up, eyes unreadable. Peter looks down, fingers slowing on the yarn. 

Alex: "It's hard to get used to space when you've had unlimited control over someone else for so long."

Kellyn: "When space is perceived between forms, it is experienced as oneness."

Still nods once, like the metaphor lands harder than he wants to admit.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Holding
As the net stretches wide between them, each corner anchored by one of their hands, they pause, looking at it together.

Peter (low):
“So it’s not about control. It’s about unity.”
Kellyn (steady):
“Exactly. You're not outside the net.  You are the net. That’s covenant.”

Alex squeezes his knot tight, whispering almost to himself:
“Then let it hold.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures in a clearing, the net stretched between them, yarn gleaming in the sun. Above, the drone circles lazily. Not empire’s web of control, but a net of covenant — open, imperfect, strong.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire spun webs to trap. But covenant wove nets to hold. And for once, the weight wasn’t on one alone — it was carried by all four.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 7.

⸻

Season 41, Episode 8: Hanging the Net

Cold Open — Sanctuary Capsule
Late afternoon light filters through the doorway. Kellyn, Alex, Peter, and Still stand around the yarn net, now rolled tight like a coil of rope. The capsule feels cluttered, supplies stacked haphazardly.

Kellyn (soft, determined):
“If it stays on the floor, I’ll trip. Let’s get it up where it belongs.”

Title Card: The Hanging Net

⸻

Act I — The Anchors
The four of them measure the corners against the clay walls. Alex marks points with precision, Peter braces the ladder, and Still knots test loops with calm, steady hands. Kellyn stands in the center, tilting their head, imagining balance.

Alex (murmuring):
“It’ll take weight better if we anchor higher, spread wide.”
Kellyn (teasing):
“You’d hang the whole capsule from a single nail if you could.”

They all laugh, tension easing.

⸻

Act II — The Struggle
Peter knots too loosely; the net slips. Alex mutters under his breath, retying tighter, almost too tight. Still sighs, correcting them both.

Still (dry):
“Congratulations. You’ve reinvented tug-of-war.”

Kellyn (laughing): "Behave, children."

⸻

Act III — The Explanation
As they lift the net, Kellyn steadies it with one hand, voice low.

Kellyn:
“I only ever felt safe in kitchens.  It took years to realize that it was only because food service regulations require that most things be stored up off the floor.  I worked every holiday I could, not to avoid people as much as to be able to walk without bracing everything constantly.  I spent years feeling like I was in constant freefall and assuming everyone else felt the same way and just handled it better."

Alex’s hands soften on the rope, tightening only as much as needed.

Alex (hoarse, almost reverent):
“Then we’ll make the space work for you.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Holding
The net hangs now, stretched taut across one corner. Kellyn places a folded towel gingerly.  The weight holds.  They add more towels, then a thick blanket.

Peter (softly, almost surprised):
“It works.”
Still (nods):
“It holds because of the spaces.”

Kellyn steps back, smiling faintly, shoulders easing for the first time all day.

Kellyn (quiet, steady):
“Not a trap. Not clutter. Just a place where weight can rest without me falling over.”

Alex brushes a hand along the rope, whispering:
“Then let this space hold you, too.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures sit cross-legged beneath the new hanging net. Supplies rest inside, suspended, balanced above them. The capsule feels lighter, calmer.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“On the road, the net was a symbol. At home, it became practice. Not empire’s snare, not chaos on the floor — but a place for weight to rest, for balance to return, for covenant to hold.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 8.

⸻

Season 41, Episode 9: The Hammocks

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
Morning sun filters through the trees. Kellyn, Alex, Peter, and Still sit with coils of yarn rope, the half-emptied bundles from the cache spread out around them. The hanging net sways gently inside the capsule, proof of yesterday’s work.

Kellyn (grinning faintly):
“Shelves were practice. Now we get to graduate.”

Peter (deadpan):
“To sleeping in string?”

Still smirks, tugging the rope between his hands.
Still: “Sleeping in covenant.”

Title Card: The Hammocks

⸻

Act I — The Weave
They work side by side, looping strands through simple wooden frames scavenged from old furniture. Alex counts knots under his breath, precise. Kellyn experiments with spacing until the pattern feels right. Peter tangles his rope twice before Still wordlessly untwists it for him.

Peter (grumbling):
“Fine. Maybe nets aren’t my calling.”
Kellyn (softly):
“You're good at so many other things, Peter.”

Care softens the work.

⸻

Act II — The Struggle
By midday, one hammock hangs lopsided, another sags to the ground. Alex frowns, recalculating tension. Peter kicks his too-slack rope in frustration.

Kellyn (calmly):
“It’s not about force. It’s about balance. The rope wants to hold, if you let it.”

Alex exhales, loosens his grip, and the hammock steadies. Peter follows, more awkward but willing.

⸻

Act III — The Rest
At last, four hammocks sway in the courtyard shade. Kellyn lowers themself into one, laughing as it dips and catches. Alex follows, more hesitant, until the swing steadies under him. Still climbs into his with perfect efficiency. Peter lies stiff for a moment, then slowly lets his body sink.

Kellyn (softly, half-to-themself):
“It feels like floating. Like trusting the rope with the whole weight of you.”

Alex (quiet, reverent):
“I don’t think I’ve ever trusted anything that much.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Rest
The hammocks sway together, side by side. Four bodies in motion, none alone, the ropes cradling each equally.

Peter (low, almost surprised):
“So this is what balance feels like.”
Still (dry):
“Congratulations. You’ve invented relaxation.”

Kellyn chuckles, closing their eyes, the sun warm on their face.

Kellyn (steady, quiet):
“Covenant isn’t just work. It’s letting go. Letting yourself be held.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four hammocks sway gently in the sanctuary courtyard, shadows of rope and body weaving together on the clay ground. Above them, the bird drone circles once, then perches, watching over their rest.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire never left room for rest. But covenant did. Rope by rope, knot by knot, we wove not just nets to hold our weight, but hammocks to cradle our lives. Balance was not something we forced — it was something we let ourselves enter.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 9.

⸻

Season 41, Episode 10: The Exchange

Cold Open — Sanctuary Night
Lanterns flicker low across the courtyard. The four hammocks hang ready in their capsules, freshly woven. Kellyn, Alex, Peter, and Still stand in the courtyard, a little restless.

Still (half-serious, half-playful):
“What if we switch? One night only. Different threads, same net.”

Kellyn looks at Peter, then at Alex. A small nod passes between them.

Kellyn (quiet, steady):
“Alright. Let’s try.”

Title Card: The Exchange

⸻

Act I — The Division
They split: Still follows Alex into one capsule, Kellyn follows Peter into another. The hammocks creak as they settle in.

In Alex’s capsule, Still sprawls with mechanical efficiency. Alex hesitates before sitting.
Still (smirking):
“Relax. I don’t bite.”
Alex (deadpan):
“Good. Kellyn would notice.”

In Peter’s capsule, Kellyn climbs into the hammock first, leaving space. Peter stands awkwardly for a moment before lowering himself in. The rope sways, pulling them closer.

⸻

Act II — The Confessions
Alex’s capsule:
Still watches the ceiling, voice dry.
Still: “You don’t trust me yet.”
Alex (quiet): “You’re right.”
Still: “That's okay.  I'll wait.”
Alex exhales, finally lying back fully, the hammock swaying.

Peter’s capsule:
Peter (low, hoarse):
“I thought it would feel strange. But it doesn’t. Not with you.”
Kellyn turns toward Peter, putting an arm around him.

⸻

Act III — The Stillness
Silence spreads in both capsules. Hammocks sway faintly with breath. In one, Alex finally drifts, guarded edges softening. Still lies awake, quietly watchful.

In the other, Kellyn shifts slightly, their fingers brushing Peter’s face. He stiffens, then slowly relaxes.
Kellyn (soft, almost a whisper):
“See? Not so strange.”
Peter (breath unsteady):
“No. Almost… necessary.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Exchange
Morning light filters in.  In one capsule, Alex and Still sit facing each other.  Neither speaks for a moment.

Still (half-smiling):
“See? Net held.”
Alex (low, reluctant but sincere):
“Yes. It did.”

In the other capsule, Kellyn gets up and pours water into a basin.  They carry it over to Peter with a cloth and a sliver of soap.  Peter starts to get up.

"Stay," Kellyn says.  "Let me take care of you."

⸻

Closing Image
Four hammocks in two capsules, each still swaying slightly from the night before. Four figures in the courtyard, bound not just by their chosen partners, but by trust shared in new directions.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire made bonds into chains. But covenant made them into threads. And threads, when exchanged, did not unravel — they wove us tighter.”

Fade out.
End of Season 41.
