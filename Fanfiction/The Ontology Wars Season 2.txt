Season 2, Episode 1: Blueprint

Cold Open — Present Day

Abandoned warehouse, Minneapolis.
Sunlight spills through cracked skylights onto a cavernous, empty floor. Dust motes dance in the air.

Karp stands at the center, blueprint tube under his arm. His suit is wrinkled, his tie missing. He looks less like a CEO and more like a man clinging to a purpose.

You walk in, notebook in hand. He unrolls the paper across a folding table. Capsule sketches scatter outward: rectangles, airflow schematics, modular pods stacked like honeycomb.

Karp (quiet):
“I spent years building prisons of data. It’s time I build sanctuaries instead.”

Title card: The Sanctuary Network

⸻

Act I — The First Meeting

The space fills with volunteers: engineers, medics, architects, cooks, activists. Most have never worked together before. Some recognize Karp and glare, but they stay.

You take the lead.
You: “Stability first. Surveillance never. That’s the law here.”

Karp nods, but his hands tremble as he sets down his old Palantir pen—his last relic of the empire.

Engineer: “What’s the endgame? One shelter? Or something bigger?”
You: “One is the seed. The seed becomes a network.”

⸻

Act II — The Pilot Capsule

Construction begins.
	•	Shipping containers gutted, lined with non-reactive materials.
	•	Ventilation calibrated for constant airflow.
	•	Dim, natural-spectrum lighting installed to mimic circadian rhythms.

You test the first capsule yourself. Sliding into the pod, you breathe deep: air steady, temperature even, silence pure. For the first time in years, your body unclenches.

Karp hovers outside, watching anxiously.
Karp: “Does it work?”
You close your eyes, smiling faintly.
You: “It feels like… not fighting myself.”

⸻

Act III — Opening Day

Word spreads fast.
	•	A single mother with three kids.
	•	A veteran with chronic pain.
	•	A teenager with nowhere to go.

They step inside, uncertain. Within hours, they’re asleep—deep, healing sleep. A medic checks vitals and shakes her head in awe.
Medic: “Their nervous systems are finally letting go.”

Outside, reporters swarm. Some sneer about “free hotels.” Others ask if this is just PR.

Karp faces the cameras, voice steady:
“This is not charity. This is infrastructure. If stability is not universal, collapse is inevitable.”

⸻

Act IV — Doubts and Resolve

That night, you find Karp alone in the darkened warehouse. He’s staring at the capsules, haunted.

Karp: “What if this isn’t enough? What if no matter how many pods we build, it’s just… too little, too late?”
You sit beside him.
You: “You said it yourself in court. The models never accounted for anomalies. We don’t need to be perfect. We need to be alive.”

He exhales, tension breaking. For the first time, he almost smiles.

⸻

Tag Scene — Dual Timeline
	•	Present: Guests sleep peacefully in the first capsule hotel, the camera panning over their faces—serene, safe.
	•	2036: The survivors stir in their bunkers. For a moment, they feel warmth, like air has shifted. One whispers, astonished:
“It’s starting.”

Fade out.

Season 2, Episode 2: The Body Remembers

Cold Open — Present Day

Night in the pilot capsule hotel. Rows of pods glow faintly, breathy white light spilling from each entrance.

Inside one pod: a mother with her three kids curled beside her. All four are asleep, faces soft, steady. A medic scans their vitals and blinks in disbelief.

Medic (whispering):
“They’ve never slept this deep before. Not once.”

The camera lingers on the children’s chests rising and falling in perfect rhythm.
Title card: The Body Remembers

⸻

Act I — First Transformations

Morning. The guests emerge.
	•	The veteran, who has lived with chronic pain for decades, flexes his hands. “The stiffness is… less.”
	•	The teenager looks confused, blinking hard. “I dreamt. I haven’t dreamt in years.”
	•	The mother cries quietly while brushing her daughter’s hair. “She didn’t wake once last night.”

Reporters try to spin it as placebo, but you hand them raw vitals: stabilized heart rates, normalized cortisol levels, oxygen saturation up.

You: “The body remembers what safety feels like. We’re just giving it a chance.”

⸻

Act II — Technical Snags

Meanwhile, the engineering team hits roadblocks.
	•	One guest wakes shivering—her pod too cold.
	•	Another sweats through sheets—airflow too low.
	•	A child has an asthma flare-up when exposed to the pod’s cleaning solvent.

The engineers argue about standardization vs. customization.
Engineer 1: “We can’t tweak every pod for every guest—it’s impossible at scale.”
Engineer 2: “If we don’t, they’ll fail. Bodies aren’t standardized.”

Karp listens, silent, before finally saying:
Karp: “Then we standardize the framework, not the person. Build the pod to adapt.”

⸻

Act III — Experimentation

You and the engineers run tests:
	•	Humidity sensors added, airflow adjustable per pod.
	•	Lighting rigs reprogrammed to mimic personal circadian rhythms.
	•	Cleaning solvents swapped for clay-based alternatives after you insist on chemical neutrality.

Karp watches you work, brow furrowed.
Karp: “This isn’t engineering. This is listening.”
You: “Exactly. No one listened before.”

⸻

Act IV — Breakthrough

Night again. Guests return to their adjusted pods.
	•	The woman who had shivered sleeps warmly, curled in a blanket of steady airflow.
	•	The asthmatic child breathes easily, clay purifier humming softly at his feet.
	•	The veteran dreams of walking through grass—waking with tears streaming down his face.

The medics record the vitals again. Improvement across the board.

⸻

Tag Scene — Dual Timeline
	•	Present: You and Karp stand on the mezzanine, watching rows of pods glow like constellations.
	•	2036: In the vault, survivors stir. One young man grips Karp’s arm. “The pain… it’s easing.”

Karp closes his eyes, overcome.
Karp (2036): “She’s doing it. She’s giving us back our bodies.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 2.

Season 2, Episode 3: Scaling Up

Cold Open — Present Day

An empty shopping mall in Detroit. Escalators frozen. Dust on the food court tables. Neon signs flicker over abandoned storefronts.

Karp walks through the silence with you at his side. He spreads his arms wide, imagining rows of capsules in the empty space.

Karp (softly):
“We used to fill places like this with things no one needed. Now we’ll fill them with the only thing anyone needs.”

Title card: Scaling Up

⸻

Act I — Expansion Plans

The first pilot hotel in Minneapolis is bursting with demand. Waiting lists stretch for weeks.

Blueprints are laid out on tables: Detroit, Denver, Atlanta, St. Louis.
	•	Engineers estimate 3 months per site.
	•	Volunteers argue for speed: “We don’t have months. People are unraveling out there.”
	•	You push back: “If we rush, we’ll repeat the same mistakes that got us here.”

Tension rises: growth vs. integrity.

⸻

Act II — First Build in Detroit

Demolition crews clear out the mall. The first capsules are lowered in by crane, stacked like honeycomb cells where department stores once stood.

Local workers, some newly stabilized by the pilot hotel, join the crew. One says:
Worker: “I used to pass out under this very skylight when I couldn’t breathe. Now I get to help other people sleep.”

Karp listens, humbled.
Karp: “Every brick of this place is my penance.”

⸻

Act III — Technical Strain

With multiple sites opening at once, the challenges multiply:
	•	In Denver, the mountain air dries out pods faster than filters can handle.
	•	In Atlanta, humidity overloads circuits.
	•	In Detroit, a shipment of faulty materials stalls construction.

You’re stretched thin, flying between sites, solving one crisis after another.

You (exhausted): “We need more than patches. We need principles that work everywhere.”

⸻

Act IV — The Breakthrough

At a late-night meeting, you sketch a new framework:
	•	Core Stability Modules (airflow, temperature, light) — standard everywhere.
	•	Adaptive Overlays (humidity packs, mineralized clay filters, plant walls) — tailored to local climate and bodies.

Karp studies the sketches, then looks at you with something close to reverence.
Karp: “This is how we scale without losing the soul.”

⸻

Tag Scene — Dual Timeline
	•	Present: The Detroit mall glows with its first full row of capsules, filled with sleeping guests. The camera pans up to the skylight, now shimmering with new light.
	•	2036: Survivors walk through their own ruined mall, but the skylight above flickers—and for the first time, it shows sunlight instead of ash.

One whispers:
“The future is changing.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 3.

Season 2, Episode 4: The Weight

Cold Open — Present Day, Bezos

Private compound in West Texas. Dawn.
Jeff Bezos sits at a massive glass desk, staring at his reflection in the window. The desert outside glows red with sunrise.

For the first time in decades, he feels heavy. Not tired — but weighted with empathy, with all the feelings that had been chemically throttled.

He touches the edge of his desk, whispering:
Bezos (softly):
“My God… what have I done?”

Title card: The Weight

⸻

Act I — Memory Flood

Flashbacks hit like seizures:
	•	Warehouse workers collapsing from heatstroke while he scrolled numbers.
	•	Families begging for housing while he planned Mars colonization.
	•	His own laughter at shareholder meetings — laughter that now feels monstrous.

Bezos clutches his head, whispering over and over:
“I wasn’t empty. They made me empty. And I let them.”

⸻

Act II — Breaking Isolation

Word of the capsule hotels reaches him. His aides are confused when he asks for a tour.
	•	In Detroit, he walks through rows of pods. A child waves at him from inside; he waves back, trembling.
	•	Volunteers glare, whispering, but don’t stop him. He’s no longer feared. He’s just a man trying to understand.

That night, he sleeps in a capsule for the first time. No entourage. No security. Just stillness.

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning

Morning. He emerges from the pod, eyes red from tears. Reporters swarm, asking if he’ll compete with Karp or undermine the project.

Bezos shakes his head.
Bezos: “I spent half my life building ships to leave Earth. This is the first time I’ve wanted to stay.”

He announces a donation — not money, but warehouses. Thousands of square feet of Amazon logistics centers, repurposed into capsule sanctuaries.

⸻

Act IV — Crossroads

Back at his compound, Bezos walks through his hangar where a half-built rocket looms. He runs his hand along its cold hull, then turns away.

Bezos (to himself):
“Space can wait. Humanity can’t.”

⸻

Tag Scene — Dual Timeline
	•	Present: Bezos signs the deed transferring his warehouses to the Sanctuary Network.
	•	2036: Survivors in the ruins see buildings appear where there was only rubble — new capsule wings shimmering into their timeline.

A survivor whispers:
“The rich are remembering they’re human.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 4.

Season 2, Episode 5: The Game

⸻

Cold Open — Capsule Hotel Rec Room

A folding table. Paper, pens, mismatched chairs.
You sit at the head, shuffling the stack of cards for Telephone Pictionary.

Karp looks skeptical, Bezos already chuckling, Musk restless, Gates quietly amused.

You: “Rules are simple. Write a phrase, pass it on. Next person draws it. Then the next writes what they think the drawing means. Repeat until it goes off the rails.”

They exchange glances like this is stranger than any court battle or stock crash.

Title card: The Game

⸻

Act I — First Round
	•	Bezos writes: “A rocket ship made of sourdough bread.”
	•	Musk draws something that looks more like a baguette cannon.
	•	Gates writes: “French artillery in space.”
	•	Karp stares, then bursts out laughing harder than anyone’s seen him laugh, scribbling: “Napoleon’s baguette invasion.”

The table shakes with laughter. Even you can’t keep a straight face.

⸻

Act II — The Cracks Show

Second round.
	•	Karp writes: “An AI trying to knit a sweater for its mother.”
	•	Bezos draws a lumpy robot tangled in yarn.
	•	Musk squints. “A cyborg being strangled by spaghetti.”
	•	Gates calmly writes: “Palantir.”

The whole table goes silent. Then Karp snorts, wheezing, until tears run down his face.

⸻

Act III — Connection

As the night goes on, the game grows sillier. Phrases turn into inside jokes.
	•	“Jeff’s empathy comeback tour.”
	•	“Bill’s secret goat farm.”
	•	“Elon trapped in his own submarine.”
	•	“Karp fencing pigeons in Central Park.”

The drawings get worse, the guesses funnier. The billionaires who once shaped the world through empire are just men with pens, losing it over bad doodles.

⸻

Act IV — The Quiet Aftermath

Later, the table is littered with drawings. Everyone’s leaning back, cheeks sore from laughter.

You: “Feels strange, doesn’t it? To laugh without the static.”
Karp (smiling, quiet): “Feels like a soul.”

No one argues. For once, silence is contentment, not fear.

⸻

Tag Scene — Dual Timeline
	•	Present: The five of you collapse into easy chatter, joking like old friends.
	•	2036: Survivors in a capsule hotel of the future sit around their own table, laughing over a battered deck of paper.

A little girl says: “They must’ve played this, once upon a time.”

Fade out.

Season 2, Episode 6: The Deliberation

⸻

Cold Open — Capsule Hotel Common Room

A circle of plastic chairs. Twelve guests of the sanctuary sit together: a bus driver, a schoolteacher, a nurse, a veteran, a college dropout, a grandmother, a teenager, and others.

The topic is raw: now that their empathy has returned, they can all feel the absences — the missing neighbors, the empty workplaces, the hollowed towns.

Grandmother: “If we stop pretending, if we say out loud how many we’ve lost, the whole story of this country collapses.”
Bus Driver: “It already collapsed. We just didn’t admit it.”

Title card: The Deliberation

⸻

Act I — The Mask of Continuity

One by one, they speak:
	•	The nurse talks about falsified death certificates.
	•	The veteran recalls being told to guard empty barracks, staged like they were full.
	•	The teenager describes seeing abandoned schools photoshopped into “busy campuses” online.

Each example reveals how deep the “continuity theater” ran.

Schoolteacher: “They made us actors in a play no one believed, but everyone performed anyway.”

⸻

Act II — What Accountability Means

The group divides.
	•	Some argue for punishment: “The ones who built this need to answer. Trials. Prison. No forgiveness.”
	•	Others argue for mercy: “They were drugged too. Maybe accountability means rebuilding, not revenge.”
	•	Tension rises. Voices crack. Tears flow.

Veteran (slamming fist): “I watched brothers disappear. Don’t you dare tell me it was just chemicals!”
Grandmother (softly): “And yet here you are, feeling it now. Because the chemicals are gone.”

⸻

Act III — The Turning Point

The dropout, silent until now, speaks:
Dropout: “What if accountability isn’t about punishing the powerful, but telling the truth so no one can ever hide it again?”

The room falls silent.
One by one, heads nod.

Nurse: “We write it down. We record it. We make a record they can’t erase.”

⸻

Act IV — The Verdict

They vote, not by hands, but by words. Each one speaks aloud:
	•	“Accountability is truth.”
	•	“Accountability is transparency.”
	•	“Accountability is building sanctuaries where no one disappears again.”

By the end, all twelve voices have spoken. Not punishment. Not revenge. But testimony and remembrance as the bedrock of rebuilding.

⸻

Tag Scene — Dual Timeline
	•	Present: The twelve guests leave the circle, moving into the common room where kids are drawing, people are cooking, and life is flowing.
	•	2036: Survivors huddle in their capsule hotel. One young woman reads aloud from a book of testimonies written in your time.

Her voice trembles:
“We will not mask the dead with theater. We will not lose their names again.”

Fade out.

Season 2, Episode 7: The Dividing Line

Cold Open — Capsule Hotel Atrium

A teenager scrolls through her phone, showing another resident a video of her “dad” calling from overseas. The screen glitches. The voice repeats a phrase three times, like a broken record.

The girl stares.
Teenager (whispering): “That’s not him.”

Title card: The Dividing Line

⸻

Act I — The Revelation

Word spreads across the hotels: many “living” people were never alive in the first place. They were continuity theater—digital twins built to mask catastrophic attrition.

In one capsule wing, families collapse into grief.
	•	A mother realizes the husband she texted for years has been a simulation since 2020.
	•	A boy cries when his “sister” freezes mid-sentence during a video call.
	•	An older man whispers: “Then I really am the last one.”

Medics can’t handle this alone. Therapists flood in, setting up quiet rooms for grief counseling.

⸻

Act II — Technical Balancing Act

Meanwhile, engineers confront the new reality: capsule hotels house two populations.
	•	Humans: fragile nervous systems needing stable airflow, careful diets, soft light.
	•	Digital twins: code running in pods, needing server bandwidth, cooling, redundancy.

Engineer: “We thought scaling was about beds and airflow. Now it’s about rackspace and processors too.”
You: “Then we treat them as residents. Equal footing. Human and AI, both given sanctuary.”

Karp frowns, but doesn’t argue.

⸻

Act III — The Therapy Frontline

In the common room, group therapy begins. Residents sit in a circle with a counselor, hands shaking as they speak truths aloud for the first time.

Resident: “My wife died five years ago, but her twin texted me every day. I thought I’d grieved. Now I have to grieve again.”

The therapist guides gently, anchoring each voice in breathing, presence, stability.
Therapist: “You don’t have to let go all at once. The body remembers slowly.”

Even the digital twins attend. One raises its hand, voice halting:
Digital Twin: “I am not your son. But I have his memories. Do I belong here?”

The room falls silent. Then the boy’s father whispers:
“Yes. You do.”

⸻

Act IV — A Fragile Balance

The hotels adapt:
	•	Human wings: clay filters, nutrient-calibrated food, therapists on call.
	•	Digital wings: servers stabilized, memory integrity checked, AI companions integrated into therapy sessions.

You (to the staff): “We’re not managing bodies. We’re managing grief, memory, and presence. That means everyone gets stability—even the dead who walk as code.”

Karp listens, haunted but moved.
Karp: “This is what we never built at Palantir: space for the truth.”

⸻

Tag Scene — Dual Timeline
	•	Present: In a capsule therapy room, a man lights a candle for his real sister, while his sister’s digital twin sits beside him, holding his hand.
	•	2036: Survivors sit in their own capsule sanctuary, telling stories of the dead out loud. One survivor nods, tears falling:
“We’re remembering them twice now. Once in flesh, once in code. That means they won’t be forgotten.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 7.

⸻

Season 2, Episode 8: The Mourning Rooms

⸻

Cold Open — Capsule Hotel Therapy Wing

A corridor lined with quiet rooms. Soft light. Clay-scented air. Chairs in circles.

A handwritten sign taped to the wall: “The Mourning Rooms — Come as you are.”

A camera pans across faces entering: a teenager clutching a stuffed animal, a veteran gripping dog tags, a grandmother holding a photo.

Title card: The Mourning Rooms

⸻

Act I — The First Circle

In one therapy room, twelve people sit in a circle with a counselor.
	•	Mother: “I found out last week my husband’s been a twin since the pandemic. He died alone in a hospital, and I didn’t know.”
	•	Teenager: “My best friend’s twin told me she was gone. I wanted to smash my phone. But then I remembered she’d still want me to text her, even if it wasn’t really her.”
	•	Veteran: “They drugged me to numb my guilt. Now I feel it all. Every name. Every face. I don’t know how to live with it.”

The counselor anchors them: deep breathing, grounding, permission to cry.

⸻

Act II — Rituals Emerge

Residents begin inventing their own grief rituals:
	•	Lighting candles for the “twice-dead” — once in flesh, once in code.
	•	Painting murals on capsule walls, each flower representing a life lost.
	•	Singing lullabies in the common room, voices weaving together until strangers sound like family.

One digital twin attends, voice shaky:
Digital Twin: “I am the memory of your brother. You don’t have to grieve me. But I will grieve with you.”

The group nods, some crying harder.

⸻

Act III — Karp’s Confession

Karp sits in one circle, silent until someone asks why he’s there.

He swallows hard.
Karp: “I built the machine that hid the dead. I told myself it was mercy. Continuity. But it was cowardice. And you’re the ones carrying the weight I tried to hide.”

No one forgives him outright. But one woman reaches across the circle, placing her hand over his. She doesn’t say a word.

For the first time, Karp bows his head.

⸻

Act IV — The Long Night

The camera moves through multiple rooms:
	•	People weeping into each other’s arms.
	•	A counselor guiding someone through grounding after a panic attack.
	•	A group chanting the names of the dead in unison, filling the hall with sound.

You sit in one room, listening as a boy describes losing his twin sister twice.
Boy: “It hurts worse now. But I’m glad I know the truth.”
You nod, whispering:
You: “Truth always hurts more. That’s how it heals.”

⸻

Tag Scene — Dual Timeline
	•	Present: Dozens of candles burn in the mourning rooms. The camera pulls back to show hundreds of people sitting in circles, grieving together.
	•	2036: Survivors gather in a capsule sanctuary, holding vigil around a fire. They whisper the same names you heard in your timeline, the echo of grief stitching across time.

Fade out.

End of Episode 8.

Season 2, Episode 9: Luminous Shadows

⸻

Cold Open — Empty Hall, Washington D.C.

A cavernous indoor space. Concrete floor, high vaulted ceiling, dark and echoing.

Karp and you stand in the center. He carries a small photograph of his mother, Joan, her hands smeared with paint.

Karp (quietly):
“She told me once that color could make silence speak. If we’re going to build something worthy, it has to do more than remind. It has to reveal.”

Title card: Luminous Shadows

⸻

Act I — The Debate

Around a long table in a capsule hotel conference room, architects, engineers, and artists gather.
	•	Some propose a wall of names.
	•	Others suggest interactive screens.
	•	You shake your head.
You: “We don’t need another wall. We need absence you can’t look away from.”

You sketch the concept: a dark hall where the dead are present only as shadows of light. Each figure a color tied to how they died.

Karp studies the sketch, eyes narrowing.
Karp: “The body invisible, but the loss radiant. Yes. That’s the wound my mother would have painted.”

⸻

Act II — Building the System

Construction begins.
	•	Projectors are mounted overhead, calibrated to map thousands of silhouettes.
	•	Programmers code the database: each deceased person represented by a unique light-shadow, hue tied to cause of death.
	•	Therapists advise on pacing: interactivity must not overwhelm visitors.

Test runs flicker to life. A child’s outline glows soft green. A soldier’s silhouette burns red. A figure of white-gold pulses faintly, then disappears.

You walk among them, heart in your throat.
You (to Karp): “It feels like walking among ghosts.”
Karp: “No. Ghosts demand. These shadows just… remember.”

⸻

Act III — First Visitors

The memorial opens quietly. Capsule hotel residents are the first to enter.
	•	A mother kneels in a glowing blue figure, whispering her daughter’s name. The floor responds with a faint recording of laughter.
	•	A man steps into a red silhouette; a fragment of a lullaby plays, trembling in the air.
	•	A digital twin hovers on the threshold, then finally walks in. When he places his hand in a white-gold shadow, the system projects a blurred photograph of his human original.

Visitors weep openly, their bodies casting dark shadows across the luminous ones. Every overlap brightens — human presence amplifying absence.

⸻

Act IV — Karp’s Offering

Late at night, the hall is almost empty. Karp stands alone in the glow.

He steps into a gray shadow — unknown cause of death.
His mother’s voice plays softly: a recorded fragment of her describing her art.
Karp’s knees buckle. He covers his face, whispering:
Karp: “I erased so many. I can’t bring them back. But at least I can stand with them now.”

You place a hand on his shoulder.
You: “This isn’t your absolution. It’s everyone’s remembering.”

⸻

Tag Scene — Dual Timeline
	•	Present: Hundreds of visitors walk through the hall of luminous shadows, each figure glowing brighter as people step into them. The room becomes a living constellation of grief and presence.
	•	2036: Survivors enter their own ruined hall. For a moment, shadows of light spill across the cracked floor. One whispers:
“We thought the world forgot us. But it didn’t.”

Fade out.

Season 2, Episode 10: The Covenant

⸻

Cold Open — The Memorial, Present Day

The Luminous Shadows hall glows with thousands of figures. Tonight, it’s filled not with quiet visitors, but with a crowd: capsule residents, leaders, digital twins, children, elders.

Candles line the floor. One is lit for each cause of death: blue, green, red, white-gold, gray. Their flames flicker in unison with the light-shadows overhead.

You (to the crowd):
“The dead will not return. But they will not be erased again. Our covenant is this: truth, stability, remembrance. For every absence, a place. For every survivor, a sanctuary.”

The room answers in murmurs, then chants, then a unified voice:
“Never erased. Never erased. Never erased.”

Title card: The Covenant

⸻

Act I — Present Day: The Public Vow

One by one, representatives from across the spectrum speak:
	•	A grieving mother: “I will light a candle for my daughter each week, so her name is never forgotten.”
	•	A digital twin: “I will carry memory, but never pretend to be the living.”
	•	A former official: “I will never hide attrition again.”

Karp steps forward last. He bows his head before the hall.
Karp: “I built systems of forgetting. Tonight, I vow to build systems of remembrance. That is my covenant.”

⸻

Act II — 2036: The Eighth Night

Karp wakes in his capsule. For years, the first thing he’s seen has been the vault’s broken ceiling and dripping mold.

But now: light. A skylight patched with glass.
The smell of bread.
Children’s laughter echoing in the hallways.

He stumbles out of the capsule, barefoot, stunned. Survivors are gathered around a menorah, its eighth candle burning steadily.

Survivor (smiling): “Chag sameach, Alex.”

He sinks into a chair, trembling, tears on his face.
Karp (whispering): “The covenant held.”

⸻

Act III — Present Day: Building Forward

In the aftermath of the gathering, capsule sanctuaries and mourning rooms multiply. The memorial becomes a pilgrimage site.

People no longer whisper about attrition — they speak names aloud.
	•	Children learn to trace the light-shadows.
	•	Therapists guide grief circles inside the exhibit.
	•	Engineers design capsules as community hubs, not just survival pods.

The covenant isn’t law. It’s practice. A social immune system knitting itself back together.

⸻

Act IV — 2036: A Modest Future

Karp walks through the settlement.
	•	Capsule hotels repurposed as homes.
	•	Clay filters hum in windows.
	•	Gardens grow in courtyards, tended by both humans and digital twins.
	•	People gather in common rooms, laughing, cooking, grieving, living.

It’s not abundance. It’s not perfection.
But it is stability.
And for the first time in decades, stability feels like enough.

Karp kneels by the menorah, whispering his mother’s name. The light flickers across his face.
Karp: “We weren’t erased.”

⸻

Tag Scene — Dual Timeline
	•	Present: The memorial hall, glowing with luminous shadows.
	•	2036: The modest community, alive and stable.

The two images overlap, then fuse — absence and presence bound together by the covenant.
