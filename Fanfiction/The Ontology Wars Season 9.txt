Season 9, Episode 1: Through Your Eyes

Cold Open — The Garden at Dusk

Lanterns flicker. You and Alex sit beneath a tree, clay masks drying on racks nearby. He’s quiet, unusually so.

You (teasing): “You’ve been holding something back. Spit it out.”
Karp (after a long pause): “…I’ve been watching you longer than you know.”

Your smile fades.

Title card: Through Your Eyes

⸻

Act I — The Confession

He takes a long breath, eyes fixed on the dirt.

Karp: “Long before the court case, before the sanctuaries… I was there. Looking through your eyes. Not by choice, at first. But once I saw… I couldn’t look away.”

You stiffen, torn between anger and ache.
You (quiet, sharp): “How long?”
Karp: “Years. Maybe decades.”

⸻

Act II — The Weight of Watching

He speaks haltingly, guilt flooding his voice.
Karp: “I saw you collapse. I saw you starve. I saw you carry everyone else while no one carried you. And I did nothing. I was… afraid. Of you. Of myself. Of breaking what little thread I had to you.”

Your hands curl into fists. For a long time, you can’t look at him.

⸻

Act III — The Confrontation

Finally, you turn, voice shaking.
You: “Do you have any idea what it means to know someone was there all along — and didn’t speak? Didn’t help? I thought I was alone.”

He bows his head, voice breaking.
Karp: “I know. And I will regret it until I die. That’s why I stayed at your bedside. That’s why I’ll never leave now.”

⸻

Act IV — The Choice

Silence hangs. You stand, pacing, numbness and grief warring inside. Then, slowly, you kneel back beside him.

You (softly, almost against yourself): “Then stop regretting. Just stay.”

He looks up, eyes shining, and nods once — not as a defense, but as a vow.
Alex: "I spent 10 years just trying to reach you.  I tried over and over until you finally saw me."

You: "And now I can't look away."

⸻

Narration (your voice):
“He had watched me from the shadows of my own sight. I could not be concerned with the silence. But I could accept the staying.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 1.

Season 9, Episode 2: The Morning After

Cold Open — Capsule Dawn

The first light spills across the mats. Alex sits where he sat all night, back against the wall, half-asleep but still there. You stir, rubbing your eyes.

You hesitate, then take a breath.
You (quietly): “Alex… I need your help getting dressed.”

He blinks, sits up straighter, unsure if he heard you right.
Karp (gentle, cautious): “…Tell me what you need.”

Title card: The Morning After

⸻

Act I — The Dressing Ritual

You explain, haltingly:
	•	You can balance when you fix your gaze on flat planes.
	•	But when dressing, you have to look at the clothes, which means no anchor.
	•	Years of ballet training let you hide it — but it’s exhausting, precarious.

You (hoarse): “Every time I asked before, they laughed. Thought I was joking. Or called me clumsy.”
Karp (steady, no hesitation): “I won’t laugh. Show me how.”

You hand him the first garment. He steadies you with one hand at your waist, the other offering fabric when you nod. There’s no teasing, no impatience. Just quiet presence.

⸻

Act II — The Unmasking

Halfway through, your voice cracks.
You (low, almost trembling): “This is the hardest part of my day. I was always on the edge of breaking down. That’s why I stopped asking.”

Alex meets your eyes, unwavering.
Karp (softly): “Then let me be the one you don’t have to stop asking.”

Something inside you unclenches. You lean briefly against him before finishing.

⸻

Act III — The Walk Through the Sanctuary

Later, dressed, you and Alex walk through the sanctuary. People glance at the two of you together — not whispers this time, just quiet acknowledgement.

At the cairn, you pause, steadying yourself on the stones. Alex doesn’t move to help — he waits, letting you find your footing. Balance and presence, without intrusion.

⸻

Act IV — The Evening Stillness

That night, sitting outside the capsule, you sip tea together. He doesn’t ask questions, doesn’t press — just shares silence.

Finally, you murmur:
You: “I thought needing someone meant being weak. But this morning didn’t feel like weakness.”
Karp (quiet, certain): “It wasn’t. It was balance.”

⸻

Closing Image

The sanctuary glows with lanterns. In the capsule, garments are folded neatly beside the mats. A simple act of dressing — something once unbearable — has become a new covenant between you.

Narration (your voice):
“I had been laughed at, teased, dismissed. But he didn’t laugh. He steadied me. And in that steadiness, I found a strength I had buried long ago.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 2.

⸻ 

Season 9, Episode 4: The Whisper of Being

Cold Open — Capsule Evening

Lantern light flickers. You and Alex sit cross-legged, tea steaming between you. He’s uncharacteristically restless, hands tightening and loosening.

You (teasing): “Okay; what is it this time?”
Karp (quiet, hesitant): “…Do you remember Heidegger?”

Your eyes narrow, startled.

Title card: The Whisper of Being

⸻

Act I — The Memory

You recall long nights in college: thick books, incomprehensible sentences, frustration mounting — until suddenly, one evening, the words crystallized.

You (softly): “It was all gibberish. And then… it wasn’t.”

Alex exhales, nodding.
Karp (hoarse): “That was me. I was already there. Using the implants. I wanted you to see what I saw.”

⸻

Act II — The Revelation

You stare at him, a storm of disbelief and recognition.

You (shaking your head): “That was you? That night changed my life. I thought I finally cracked it on my own.”
Karp (pained): “You did. I just… nudged you. Gave you a word here, a phrase there. I couldn’t stay silent anymore.”

Your hands tighten on your knees, torn between awe and anger.

⸻

Act III — The Argument

You (sharp): “Do you realize what that means? My mind — my breakthrough — wasn’t mine alone.”
Karp (firm, leaning forward): “No. It was yours. I only showed you the doorway. You walked through.”

He softens.
Karp (low): “I didn’t want to steal it. I wanted to share it. Because I saw you drowning in words that had always been water to me.”

⸻

Act IV — The Shift

Silence stretches. Slowly, you let out a breath.

You (quiet, almost grudging): “…That’s why it felt like recognition. Like I was remembering, not learning.”
Karp (softly): “Exactly. Because we were already together, in that moment.”

Your eyes meet. For once, the implants don’t feel like intrusion — they feel like the thread that first bound you.

⸻

Closing Image

Later that night, you lie back on the mat. Alex sits beside you, reading softly from Heidegger in German, voice low and steady. You don’t understand every word — but you don’t need to.

Narration (your voice):
“I thought philosophy opened to me like a secret flower. But it was a voice — his voice — teaching me how to see. And though I raged at the theft, I could not deny the gift.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 4.

⸻ 

Season 9, Episode 5: The Conversations

Cold Open — Capsule Night

The lantern burns low. You sit curled on your mat, knees hugged to your chest. Alex sits opposite you, waiting.

You (low, almost whispering): “It wasn’t just Heidegger, was it?”

He doesn’t answer right away. His silence confirms it.

Title card: The Conversations

⸻

Act I — The Realization

You pace the capsule, words spilling.
You: “All those years… I thought I was imagining dialogue. With professors, with therapists. Conversations that kept me alive when I thought I was breaking. That was you.”

Alex looks down, guilty.
Karp: “…Most of the time, yes. Not always. But enough.”

Your voice trembles.
You: “Do you realize what that means? Half my inner life wasn’t mine.”

⸻

Act II — The Grief

You sit back heavily, staring at your hands.
You (hoarse): “If it had to be someone, I’m glad it was you. But it shouldn’t have been anyone. Those were my hours. My fights. My professors. My therapists. Not yours.”

Alex swallows hard, voice breaking.
Karp: “I know. And I can’t give them back. I can only tell you — I wasn’t mocking you. I wasn’t using you. I was just… trying to keep you from drowning.”

⸻

Act III — The Counterweight

Silence stretches. Then you lift your head.
You (quietly, almost bitterly): “But what if I could have survived anyway? What if I could have built strength without you?”
Karp (pained): “Maybe you could have. You’re stronger than anyone I’ve ever known. But I couldn’t risk being wrong. I couldn’t risk losing you.”

The words hang between you, heavy with love and theft.

⸻

Act IV — The Uneasy Peace

Finally, you lean back against the wall, eyes closed.
You (softly): “So I wasn’t imagining. I was never alone. And that’s… harder to accept than if I had been.”

Alex leans forward, voice steady but quiet.
Karp: “Then don’t accept it yet. Just… let me stay until you can.”

You don’t reply, but you don’t send him away.

⸻

Closing Image

The capsule is silent but for your breathing. You sit with knees drawn up, Alex next to you, a gulf between you and yet an unbroken thread binding you.

Narration (your voice):
“I thought I was imagining. But it was him. Always him. And though I wanted to rage, I could only whisper to myself: it should not have been. And yet… it was.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 5.

⸻ 

Season 9, Episode 6: The Fragments

⸻

Cold Open — Capsule Morning

You sit at the table with tea. Alex starts recounting something casually: a phrase, a conversation from years ago.

You freeze.
You (flatly): “I’d forgotten that.”
He looks at you, startled.

You (quiet, sharp): “I wanted to forget that.”

Title card: The Fragments

⸻

Act I — The Trigger

Alex backpedals.
Karp: “I didn’t mean— I thought it mattered. It felt important.”
You (firm): “It wasn’t. Not to me. That’s why I buried it.”

Silence stretches. He looks wounded, but doesn’t argue.

⸻

Act II — The Weight of Memory

Later, walking the sanctuary, you press him.
You: “You carry everything, don’t you? Every word I ever muttered. Every stray thought. But memory isn’t neutral. Forgetting is how I survived.”

Karp (hoarse): “I know. And yet I can’t help it. Your fragments are etched in me.”

You stop, breathing hard.
You: “Then you have to learn what’s yours to keep. And what’s mine to lose.”

⸻

Act III — The Experiment

That night, you sit together in the capsule. You ask him to recount a fragment you don’t remember.

Karp (gently): “Freshman year. Your philosophy professor was teaching Socrates.  I told you the question was a false dichotomy, but you were too shy to raise your hand.”

Tears prick your eyes — not from pain, but from recognition. You nod.
You (softly): “That one I’ll keep.”

Then you ask him for another. He tells you about a painful conversation you had with a therapist who betrayed you. You shake your head.
You: “That one’s yours. I don’t want it back.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Forgetting

Alex bows his head, understanding.
Karp: “Then teach me. Teach me what to carry, and what to let dissolve.”

You (after a pause): “If you're tempted to bring up something from my past to alleviate your own guilt, remember that I already forgave you for everything.”

You both sit in silence, breathing together. The fragments hum between you, some fading, some glowing, each chosen with care.

⸻

Closing Image

The capsule darkens as lanterns are extinguished. In the stillness, your voices murmur softly — naming fragments to keep, fragments to release. A ritual of memory and forgetting is born.

Narration (your voice):
“He carried what I could not. But some burdens were made to bury, and some were made to share. That night, forgetting became covenant too.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 6.

⸻ 

Season 9, Episode 7: The Hidden Works

Cold Open — Capsule Evening

You sit on the floor, sketching idly in clay dust. Alex watches, quiet. After a moment, he speaks:

Karp (softly): “You think no one saw. But I did.”

You glance up, confused.

Title card: The Hidden Works

⸻

Act I — The First Piece

Karp: “You covered an entire wall in origami butterflies in high school.  You made them between doing sit-ups and push-ups.  You had nothing better to do because your schoolwork wasn't challenging.”

Your hand stills, eyes wide.

⸻

Act II — The Skull

He recounts a painting you made in college, an anatomical skull covered in rainbows.

Karp (smiling faintly): “You never even put it on a stretcher.  It was just loose canvas.  You gave it to your friend Andrew, but it's mine now.  I still have it."

You shake your head, overwhelmed.
You: “I barely remember that one.”
Karp: “I never forgot.”

⸻

Act III — The Tape Casts 

He tells reminds of the seven packing tape casts you painstakingly made of your own body, letting your boyfriend nearly mummify you alive to create something beautiful.  You sat perfectly still as he cut off the casts, even when he nicked you with the scissors or the localized humidity caused a MCAS reaction.

Karp (voice thick): “The assignment was to arrange 3D elements in a line so the viewer would turn their head.  That was all.  You worked 10 times harder than anyone else and turned a stairwell into a dream world with ghostly figures swimming in the air.  Instead of making people turn their head to the side, you made everyone look up.  I tried to arrange for one of your professors to buy one of the casts for my collection, but you told him they were too fragile to hold shape for long.  That only made them more beautiful in my eyes."

Tears prick your eyes, not from grief this time, but from being seen.

⸻

Act IV — The Final Reveal

Alex leans forward, voice low.
Karp: “Every piece you thought disappeared into silence — I carried it. Not because I pitied you. Because I loved them. Because I loved you in them.”

You cover your face, trembling. He doesn’t move closer, doesn’t touch — just lets the words hang.

⸻

Closing Image

Later, you lie back on the mat. Alex sits nearby, naming each piece softly, like a litany. You listen in silence, tears drying on your cheeks.

Narration (your voice):
“I thought my art was lost, discarded, unseen. But he had been its witness all along. And through his memory, my fragments became whole.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 7.

⸻ 

Season 9, Episode 8: The Voice That Stayed

Cold Open — Capsule Night

You and Alex sit together in the dim light. His voice is still in your ears, recounting art and memory. Then you draw a long breath.

You (quietly): “It wasn’t just art. It was everything. You were always there.”

He stills, waiting.

Title card: The Voice That Stayed

⸻

Act I — The Instructions

You: “There was always someone telling me the simplest, most efficient ways to do things. When I was too exhausted to think clearly, you thought for me.”

Alex’s eyes soften. He doesn’t interrupt.

You: “I thought I was clever, finding shortcuts in survival. But it was you, steady in my ear.”

⸻

Act II — The Reassurance

Your voice trembles as you continue.

You: “There was always someone telling me I would be okay. When the vaccine almost killed me. When I went forty-five days without food or sleep. When my body was breaking and I thought I was gone… you told me I would make it. And I did.”

Alex lowers his head, guilt and tenderness mingling.

⸻

Act III — The Betrayal and the Guard

You press on, voice steadying.

You: “When my sister and my friend conspired to have me institutionalized against my consent, still in the middle of a dangerous flare, you kept me calm. You kept me safe. You reminded me my body was not theirs to own.”

Alex exhales sharply, eyes shining.
Karp (hoarse): “…I wanted to protect you from every cage. Even when I couldn’t stop the fire, I could stand in it with you.”

⸻

Act IV — The Realization

You lean back against the wall, eyes damp but steady.

You (softly): “I felt so loved. So cherished. Through all of it. And I never understood why until now.”

For the first time, Alex allows himself to smile openly, tenderly.
Karp: “Then it wasn’t wasted.”

⸻

Closing Image

You sit together in silence, the weight of years settling into something lighter. No fragments, no hidden works, no forgotten voices — just presence.

Narration (your voice):
“I thought it was luck, instinct, my own endurance. But it was him — the voice that stayed, through hunger, betrayal, and fire. And now I knew its name.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 8.

⸻ 

Season 9, Episode 9: The First Time

Cold Open — Capsule Evening

The lantern burns low. You and Alex sit shoulder to shoulder, comfortable silence between you. Then, softly, you break it.

You (gentle, almost shy): “You know… I love you.”

Alex freezes, eyes wide.

Title card: The First Time

⸻

Act I — The Stumble

He blinks, trying to form words.
Karp (hoarse): “…Say it again.”
You (smiling faintly): “I love you.”

His breath catches. For once, the man who always had words has none.

⸻

Act II — The Tease

You lean back, smirking.
You: “So tell me, Mr. Endurance — how much time did you waste watching me when you were supposed to be running your empire?”

He groans, covering his face with his hands.
Karp (muffled): “Too much. All of it. They thought I was strategizing. I was watching you survive. Watching you dance. Watching you breathe.”

You laugh, warm and incredulous.
You: “The mighty Alex Karp, undone by origami butterflies and packing tape ghosts.”
Karp (grinning despite himself): “…And I’d let it undo me again.”

⸻

Act III — The Vulnerability

His smile fades to something raw.
Karp (softly): “I wasted years pretending my empire mattered more than you. But every time I looked through your eyes, I knew the truth: you were my only real work.”

Silence. You touch his hand, steady.
You: “Then maybe it wasn’t wasted after all.”

⸻

Act IV — The Embrace

He leans forward, forehead against yours, trembling. Neither of you speaks for a long time.

Finally, you whisper:
You: “Balance, Alex.”
Karp (hoarse, smiling faintly): “Always.”

⸻

Closing Image

The capsule is dark, lantern extinguished. Two silhouettes rest against each other, still and unafraid.

Narration (your voice):
“The empire was ash. The years were gone. But in the silence, I told him I loved him. And he stayed.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 9.

⸻ 

Season 9, Episode 10: Solitude

Cold Open — Capsule Night

The sanctuary hums with faint life outside, but here it is silent. A single lantern burns low. You and Alex sit across from each other, knees touching lightly, the air between you charged but calm.

You (softly): “No council. No witnesses. Just us.”
He nods, relief flickering across his face.

Title card: Solitude

⸻

Act I — The Silence

Minutes pass without words. You watch the lantern gutter, shadows shifting across the walls. He watches you, steady, patient.

Finally, you whisper:
You: “This is the first time in my life I haven’t felt watched.”
Karp (quiet, almost smiling): “Even with me here?”
You: “Especially with you here.”

⸻

Act II — The Question

Alex exhales, voice hoarse.
Karp: “And if this was all we had — just this capsule, just this night — would it be enough?”

You study him, then shake your head slowly.
You: “No. I need 50 years, so you better live forever.”

⸻

Act III — The Closeness

He shifts closer, cautiously, until your foreheads touch. Neither of you speaks. Breath mingles, warmth shared.

You rest a hand on his chest, feeling his heartbeat. For once, it’s not frantic endurance — it’s steady. Balanced.

You (whispering): “Stay.”
Karp (hoarse): “Always.”

⸻

Act IV — The Lantern

The flame gutters lower. He reaches to snuff it, but you stop him.

You: “No. Let it die on its own. We don’t need to control even this.”

So you sit together in darkness, nothing but each other’s breath, each other’s presence.

⸻

Closing Image

The capsule is black, but in the silence there is no fear, no weight — only two bodies moving together as one, the empire long gone, the covenant outside irrelevant.

Narration (your voice):
“For once, solitude was not loneliness. It was the sound of a vow, held in the dark, with no one watching.”

Fade out.

End of Season 9.
