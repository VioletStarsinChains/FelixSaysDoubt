Season 22, Episode 1: The Loaf

Cold Open — Capsule Hearth
The last zucchinis sit on the table, grated into a bowl. Flour dusts the air. You crack eggs into a clay pot while Alex stirs sugar with a little too much force.

You (teasing):
“Careful. We want bread, not bricks.”
Karp (flat, but distracted):
“I’ve made heavier things.”

You pause, noticing the tension in his shoulders.

Title card: The Loaf

⸻

Act I — The Stirring
You measure cinnamon and nutmeg. He mixes, jaw tight, movements sharp.

Karp (hoarse, almost blurting):
“There’s something I never told you. I don’t know if it’ll sound like love or cruelty.”

You (gentle, steady):
“Say it anyway.”

He keeps stirring, hands trembling.

Karp:
“I kept you from joy. Not just food, not just music. People. Every time you got close to someone, I nudged them away. Friends, lovers, allies. I told myself it was protection — that no one could be trusted. But really… I couldn’t bear to share you.”

⸻

Act II — The Rising
The batter slides into a clay pan, tucked into the hearth’s coals. You sit back on your heels, wiping flour from your hands.

You (quiet, sharp):
“You sound like empire again. Hoarding. Containing. Making me scarce.”

He bows his head.

Karp (whispering):
“I know. And I hate it. But the hunger was so constant I didn’t know how else to live with it.”

You (after a long beat):
“Containment isn’t covenant. You know that now.”

⸻

Act III — The Breaking
The bread rises, golden and fragrant. You break off a piece, steam curling into the air. He watches your hand, afraid to take it.

You (firm, offering):
“This isn’t scarcity. This is sharing. If you want to stay, you have to stop treating me like something to ration.”

He takes the piece, finally biting. Chews slow, eyes wet.

Karp (hoarse):
“Sweet. Dense. Imperfect. Better than anything empire ever fed me.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Bread
You both sit cross-legged, passing torn pieces back and forth until the loaf is gone. No measuring, no withholding, no hoarding.

Karp (softly):
“I don’t want to hoard you anymore. I just want to eat beside you.”
You (quietly):
“Then don’t hoard. Just stay.”

⸻

Closing Image
Empty clay pan, crumbs scattered between two figures in the capsule. No empire, no rationing — just bread broken open, shared until nothing is left but presence.

Narration (your voice):
“He thought keeping me scarce was protection. But scarcity was empire’s lie. Covenant wasn’t containment. Covenant was bread, broken and shared until the hunger eased.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 1.

Season 22, Episode 2: The Jar

Cold Open — Capsule Night
A storm rattles faintly outside. On the mat between you sits a clay jar, lid tight. Inside: pickled onions from the cellar. Alex turns it over in his hands, knuckles white.

You (watching):
“You look like that jar owes you money.”
Karp (hoarse):
“Feels more like it’s me inside.”

Title card: The Jar

⸻

Act I — The Containment
He sets the jar down too hard, brine sloshing.

Karp:
“I contained you. Every joy, every spark, every step outside the cage — I tried to put a lid on it. Friends, lovers, even your art. If it threatened to carry you away, I tightened the seal. I told myself it was safety. But it was jealousy. I couldn’t stand the thought of someone else seeing what I saw.”

You (quiet, steady):
“So you pickled me. Preserved, not free.”

He bows his head.

⸻

Act II — The Jealousy
You pick up the jar, holding it to the light.

You:
“I knew everyone was watching. But I didn’t know it was you. You weren’t just guarding me. You were guarding me from the world.”

He meets your gaze, eyes wet.

Karp (breaking):
“Yes. Because I was afraid the world would taste you and never let me near again.”

Silence stretches. Rain patters harder.

⸻

Act III — The Breaking of the Seal
You twist the lid slowly, the pop echoing sharp in the capsule. Steam of vinegar and onion fills the air.

You:
“Containment isn’t covenant. If you loved me, you should have let me spoil. Rot, risk, change. That’s life.”

He flinches, but doesn’t argue.

Karp (hoarse):
“I know. I just… didn’t know how to live with wanting you and not owning you.”

You (firm, but soft):
“Then learn. Because I won’t be sealed again.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Taste
You spear an onion with your fingers, bite, wince at the sour. Hand him one. He takes it, chewing slow, brine dripping down his wrist.

Karp (quietly):
“Sharp. Sour. Alive. Like you.”
You (half-smiling):
“Better out of the jar than in it.”

⸻

Closing Image
The open jar sits between you, vinegar sharp in the air. Two figures eat from it, no lid, no seal — just taste, bite by bite.

Narration (your voice):
“He thought jealousy was love. He thought containment was care. But covenant wasn’t a sealed jar. It was sharp, sour, alive — and never closed again.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 2.

⸻ 

Season 22, Episode 3: The Question

Cold Open — Capsule Morning
Light spills through a crack in the clay wall. The jar of onions from the night before sits half-empty on the mat. Alex kneels nearby, silent. For once, he doesn’t speak first.

You (wry):
“Surprised you’re not confessing again.”
Karp (hoarse, steady):
“I think I’ve said enough. Now I want to know what you want.”

Title card: The Question

⸻

Act I — The Pause
The words hang heavy. You set aside your weaving, studying him.

You:
“That’s not usually how this goes. You ask, but then you steer the answer. Like you’ve already decided what I should say.”
Karp (nodding):
“Empire logic. Prediction. I thought love meant knowing before you told me. But covenant can’t survive if I’m always two steps ahead.”

He lowers his eyes. Waits.

⸻

Act II — The First Answer
You lean back against the wall, arms crossed.

You (after a beat):
“What I want is so small it feels embarrassing to say out loud.”
Karp (quiet, urging):
“Small things are the ones I never knew how to give. Tell me.”
You (softly):
“I want quiet meals without fear. I want sleep without nightmares. I want you to touch me. I want to feel like the world isn’t going to collapse every time I exhale.”

His shoulders tremble, but he doesn’t interrupt.

⸻

Act III — The Risk
Finally, he whispers:

Karp:
“And if I can’t give you all of that?”
You (sharp, steady):
“Then you don’t promise it. You ask again tomorrow. That’s covenant — not guarantees, not control. Just asking, every day, and not assuming you know.”

He exhales, shaky but lighter, like a new muscle flexing for the first time.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Asking
The two of you sit cross-legged on the mat. The jar of onions between you, brine sharp in the air.

Karp (low, almost reverent):
“Then I’ll ask, again and again. Not to predict. Not to trap. Just to listen.”
You (smiling faintly):
“Good. Because answers change. And I want you to learn to love that.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures in the capsule, one question lingering, one answer spoken. The jar of onions open — no seal, no script, no prediction. Just presence, and the promise to keep asking.

Narration (your voice):
“He thought love was knowing before I spoke. But covenant began when he asked. Not once, but daily. Not to predict, but to hear. And that question was enough.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 3.

⸻ 

Season 22, Episode 4: The Containment

Cold Open — Capsule Evening
Rain patters faintly on the clay roof. You sit cross-legged, winding dyed thread into a ball. Alex paces a few steps, then stops — fists tight, jaw working.

Karp (low, hoarse):
“I kept you contained. Not just with implants. Not just with scarcity. With jealousy.”

You look up, steady.

Title card: The Containment

⸻

Act I — The Admission
He exhales, words dragging out.

Karp:
“Any time you strayed too close to someone else, I sabotaged it. Not because they weren’t worthy. But because I couldn’t bear the thought of someone else holding what I wanted most. I told myself it was safety. But it was greed. My greed.”

You (quiet, sharp):
“You were jealous. And empire gave you the tools to make jealousy law.  But you couldn't have done that without God knows how many others enabling it."

His shoulders sag.

⸻

Act II — The Memory
He kneels, eyes wet.

Karp (whispering):
“I hated it. Every time I pulled you away, I hated myself. But I couldn’t stop. Watching you laugh with someone else felt like watching oxygen leave the room. And I panicked. I chose control over trust.”

You (after a long silence):
“You never trusted that I’d come back.”

He flinches. Doesn’t deny it.

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
You set the ball of thread down, leaning forward.

You:
“Containment isn’t covenant. You already had me. Not through fear, not through sabotage — but because you were the one who stayed. And every time you acted like you didn’t believe that, you hurt us both.”

You pause and take a deep breath.

You: "But here's the thing.  I don't even remember most of those people.  The ones I do remember, I certainly don't miss. People suck.  I don't think you engineered that."

He bows his head, trembling.

Karp (breaking):
“I was terrified of losing what I’d never been allowed to have. You were want, and want felt like fire in my hands. I thought if I loosened my grip, I’d lose you forever.”

You: "And that's perfectly understandable."

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Release
You reach out, touch his hand — not softly, but firm.

You:
“Then let go. If you want covenant, you can’t cage it. Not even me.”
He looks up, eyes raw.
Karp (whispering):
“Then I’ll practice. Even if it kills me.”
You (steady):
“It won’t. It’ll keep you alive.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures by the fire, one hand over the other. No cage, no sabotage — just the trembling start of release.

Narration (your voice):
“He thought jealousy was proof of love. He thought containment was care. But covenant meant loosening his grip, even when it terrified him. And that, too, was survival.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 4.

⸻ 

Season 22, Episode 5: The Dance

Cold Open — Capsule Courtyard
Lanterns sway in the evening breeze. A speaker crackles softly, music spilling out. You stretch your shoulders, shake out your arms. Alex stands a little apart, stiff.

You (teasing):
“Relax. No choreography. Just moving.”

Karp (dry):
“Choreography is all I’ve ever known.”

Title card: The Dance

⸻

Act I — The Poison of Control
You start to sway, small, easy movements. He watches, hesitant.

You (quiet, sharp):
“You know, I learned early that control is poison. I did ballet for years. Ballet isn’t healthy — it wasn’t designed by people who understood anatomy or physiology. It destroys the body even in the best of circumstances. And the culture? Utterly toxic. That’s why dancers all end up with eating disorders. You spend your whole life staring at yourself in a mirror, hating what you see. Ask me how I know.”

He studies you, intent.

Karp (hoarse):
“And yet you kept going.”

You (shrugging):
“I kept going because no one ever asked me what I wanted. Which… sounds a lot like empire to me.  Also, ✨ Vestibular Stimming ✨"

⸻

Act II — The Memory
You circle him slowly as you talk, arms loose, feet bare.

You:
“There was this teacher at camp — he’d use a broom handle to correct form. Never touched us. Which, fine, I get it. He was one of the only men in the room with fourteen-year-old girls. But it was dehumanizing. Everyone either hated him or feared him. I’m sure he was a good guy, but the very structure of it all made us less than human.”

Alex exhales, sharp.

Karp (low):
“That’s Palantir. I thought rules kept people safe. That if I could keep my hands off, let the machine correct them instead, I was doing right. But really, I was turning everyone into outlines on a chart. Less than human.”

⸻

Act III — The Stumble into Rhythm
You reach for his hand, tug him closer. At first his steps are stiff, like he’s afraid of misstepping. You laugh, light, and spin away.

You:
“See? You’re broom-handle dancing. Let go. Stop correcting.”

He tries again. Less control this time. More rhythm. The music carries instead of calculation.

Karp (quiet wonder):
“And you didn’t vanish.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Movement
You both move slower now, almost still, shoulder to shoulder, hands brushing.

You:
“Ballet made me hate my body. Empire made you numb to yours. But this — this isn’t control. This is rhythm. And rhythm doesn’t poison. It frees.”

Karp (hoarse, steady):
“Then let me stay here. Not as choreographer. Just as partner.”

You nod, a faint smile tugging your lips.

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures in the courtyard, lantern light flickering, bodies swaying gently together. Not ballet’s mirrors, not empire’s charts — just rhythm, shared.

Narration (your voice):
“Ballet taught me control was survival. Empire taught him control was strength. But both were poison. Covenant wasn’t in correction — it was in rhythm, moving without fear, without mirrors, without broom handles. Just presence.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 5.

⸻

Season 22, Episode 6: The Build

Cold Open — Capsule Workshop
The floor is scattered with scavenged wood, bundles of fabric, and piles of cork tiles. You crouch over a sketch scrawled in charcoal on clay board: a towering cylinder with a central pillar. Alex stands beside you, skeptical.

Karp (dry):
“You want me to build… a six-foot beverage sleeve?”
You (smirking):
“A giant human koozie. Don’t question the vision.”

Title Card: The Build

⸻

Act I — The Foundation
Alex cuts wood into curved slats, precise as always. You fit them together in a circle, your hands not as steady but quick with improvisation. The base begins to take shape.

You (teasing):
“Look at you, empire man, on your knees making plywood arcs.”
Karp (low, muttering):
“I built empires from blueprints smaller than this.”
You: “Yeah, but those didn’t have to hold me.”

⸻

Act II — The Pillar
You haul a cork-wrapped beam into place, bracing it while Alex secures it. It wobbles, then steadies.

Karp (hoarse):
“Empire logic says center pillars should never sway.”
You (grinning):
“Covenant logic says a little give keeps it standing longer.”

He pauses, then nods — lesson received.

⸻

Act III — The Walls
Together, you stitch panels from scavenged cloth: silk from an old scarf, hemp from rope unravelled, linen from torn garments, cotton from bedding. Alex ties each to the frame in exact alignment; you rearrange them deliberately so every section feels different under the hand.

You:
“Slide, stick, scratch, smooth. That’s the point.”
Karp (quiet, thoughtful):
“Not uniformity. Choice.”

⸻

Act IV — The Floor
At last, you layer the springy base: stacked mats of pressed reed, cork, and fabric scraps. You bounce on it, laughing when it shifts under your weight.

You:
“Perfect. A floor you can fall into and still stand up again.”
Karp (smiling faintly):
“You mean a floor you can trust.”

⸻

Closing Image
The giant koozie stands in the capsule, stitched panels glowing in firelight, cork pillar at its heart. You and Alex sit side by side at its rim, exhausted but satisfied.

Narration (your voice):
“He built for permanence, I built for play. But in the koozie we built together, permanence bent, play held firm — and covenant had walls at last.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 6.

⸻ 

Season 22, Episode 7: The Blindfold

Cold Open — The Capsule Koozie
The fire is low, shadows long. The giant koozie looms, its panels stirring faintly with drafts. You sit on the rim, cloth blindfold in hand. Alex stands opposite, arms folded.

You (dry):
“Peanut butter and jelly. Blindfold and sound.”
Karp (hoarse, almost smiling):
“And terror and delight.”

Title Card: The Blindfold

⸻

Act I — The Covering
You tie the cloth tight over your own eyes, hands steady. The koozie feels larger without sight, each sound amplified: fabric whispering, floor creaking, Alex’s breath shifting.

You (softly):
“Already too loud.”
Karp (low, reassuring):
“Then let’s rewrite loud.”

⸻

Act II — The Mapping
He moves around the inside perimeter, dragging fingers across different fabric panels — rough scrape, soft hiss, sharp snap. You reach out, palms hovering, orienting by sound.

Karp (teasing whisper):
“North is linen. South is hemp. East is silk.”
You (grinning despite yourself):
“West is Fish Man, trying not to laugh.”

You stumble toward the sound, hand brushing his shoulder.

⸻

Act III — The Escalation
Alex hums low, then sharp, then falls silent. He circles you, shifting distance, whispering nonsense words — close one moment, far the next. Your breath catches, body tilting as if sound itself pushes you.

You (half-laugh, half-protest):
“This is cheating.”
Karp (whispering at your ear):
“No rules against escalation.”

He grazes your wrist lightly, retreating before you can catch him.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Sound
Finally, you remove the blindfold. The koozie is quiet, Alex standing still at the center pillar, hands loose at his sides.

Karp (low, steady):
“Not ambush. Not test. Just sound, just touch, just me.”
You (smiling faintly, breath unsteady):
“Then next time — your turn.”

He nods once, solemn and willing.

⸻

Closing Image
Fabric sways, floor springy beneath. Two figures stand inside the koozie: one blinking back into sight, one ready to close his own eyes. Not empire, not torture, but covenant — practiced through sound and silence.

Narration (your voice):
“Once, sound from behind was only threat. Blindfolded, I learned to meet it. And when I opened my eyes, covenant stood waiting — steady, unarmed, still.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 7.

⸻ 

Season 22, Episode 8: The Pillar

Cold Open — The Capsule Koozie
The blindfold is in your hand this time. Alex kneels at the base of the center pillar, waiting. You loop the cloth around his head, tying it firm. He exhales once, steady but taut.

You (teasing):
“Ready for peanut butter and terror?”
Karp (flat, but with a twitch of a smile):
“Only if you’re the jelly.”

Title Card: The Pillar

⸻

Act I — The Covering
You step back, watching him. Blindfolded, he squares his shoulders, listening too intently. Every small creak of fabric makes him flinch.

Karp (hoarse):
“I already hate this.”
You (soft, amused):
“Good. Then it’s working.”

⸻

Act II — The Climb
Silently, you slip onto the pillar, hauling yourself upward hand over hand. At the top, you shift your weight deliberately. The koozie tilts, fabric swaying, floor bending with each move.

Alex stumbles, hands out.
Karp (snapping, unsteady):
“You’re moving the world!”
You (grinning, steady):
“Exactly. Now you know what it felt like to be me.”

⸻

Act III — The Descent into Play
You sway the pillar again, harder this time. He steadies himself against a wall, blindfold still on, laughing despite himself.

Karp (breathless):
“This is chaos!”
You: “Measured chaos. Your favorite.”

You slide down the pillar and land lightly. He senses the impact, body jerking toward the sound. You catch his hand, grounding him.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Instability
You pull off the blindfold. His eyes shine, still raw with adrenaline.

Karp (hoarse, almost reverent):
“So this is what it feels like — no stable floor, no fixed sound. Trusting only that you’ll catch me.”
You (softly):
“Exactly. Now we’re even.”

⸻

Closing Image
The koozie sways gently around you both — no empire, no steady ground, no fixed map. Just two figures holding on inside instability, covenant learned through imbalance.

Narration (your voice):
“Once, he moved the world to test me. Now I moved the world to meet him. Blindfolded, unsteady, he chose trust. And that choice was covenant.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 8.

⸻ 

Season 22, Episode 9: The Dark

Cold Open — Capsule Koozie
The pillar looms. Two blindfolds lie folded on the mat. You tie his first, then your own, knotting it tight until the world disappears. The capsule hums with silence, broken only by the rustle of fabric.

You (quietly, wry):
“Congratulations. Now neither of us knows where the floor is.”
Karp (hoarse):
“Story of my life.”

Title Card: The Dark

⸻

Act I — The First Steps
You both stand, tentative. Every creak of fiber feels magnified. Your hand brushes the pillar; his palm grazes your shoulder. You flinch, then exhale, leaning into the contact.

Karp (whispering):
“Tell me where you are.”
You (softly):
“Right here. Always right here.”

⸻

Act II — The Sound
You clap once. The koozie reverberates. He laughs, startled, and claps back — the echo bouncing. Soon it’s a rhythm: clap, pause, shuffle, laugh. A conversation in percussion.

You (smiling):
“This is better than words.”
Karp (low, reverent):
“It’s covenant in vibration.”

⸻

Act III — The Imbalance
You both climb the pillar by feel. Blind, awkward, slipping — until you’re halfway up together. The koozie tilts wildly, throwing balance off.

You (shouting, laughing):
“Now we’re flying blind!”
Karp (breathless, grinning):
“Then let’s crash together.”

You both let go at once, falling into the soft base with a thud.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Dark
Lying tangled, blindfolds still on, you reach out until your hands find each other. Fingers curl, steady. The silence is whole now, not threatening — just present.

Karp (hoarse):
“I thought darkness meant losing control. But with you, it feels like… home.”
You (softly):
“Darkness never scared me. Loneliness did. And this isn’t lonely.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures in the blindfolded dark, tangled but steady. No sight, no empire, no need for control — only covenant built on sound, touch, and presence.

Narration (your voice):
“Blindfolded, we found the dark wasn’t absence. It was possibility. Not fear, not loneliness — covenant.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 9.

⸻ 

Season 22, Episode 10: The Reach

Cold Open — Capsule Koozie
The blindfolds rest on the mat again. This time, Alex ties yours first, his hands careful, deliberate. Then he pulls his own into place. Darkness settles.

You (teasing):
“Alright, Fish-man. No falling off the pillar this time.”
Karp (dry, smiling):
“I make no promises.”

Title Card: The Reach

⸻

Act I — The Rope Game
You wrap a length of soft twine around the pillar, leaving both ends loose. Each of you takes one. Blind, you circle in opposite directions, tugging gently, testing weight and distance.

You (laughing):
“Feels like tetherball for the apocalypse.”
Karp (grinning):
“Better odds of survival.”

The rope pulls tight, then slackens. You tug once, sharply. He answers with two quick pulls — a code forming between you.

⸻

Act II — The Touch Game
You drop the rope, grope for him in the dark. He brushes your fingertips, then pulls away. Again. Again. Until finally your palms press together, steady, holding.

Karp (whispering):
“Even blind, I’ll find you.”
You (softly):
“Then stop letting go.”

He doesn’t let go.

⸻

Act III — The Balance Game
You guide him to the pillar. Both climb by touch, side by side, knees braced. The koozie sways under your weight, fibers groaning.

You (breathless):
“Lean left.”
Him: "How do you even know that?  You're blindfolded."
You: "✨ Echolocation ✨"
He follows, perfectly matched. The structure tilts, rights itself. You laugh, exhilarated.

Karp (hoarse, grinning):
“Feels like flying blind.”
You (smirking):
“Feels like trust.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Touch
You slide down together, landing in a heap. Still blindfolded, you curl against him, one hand resting over his chest. His breath slows under your palm.

Karp (quietly):
“Every game was empire to me before. Win, lose, dominate. But this—”
You (softly):
“Not a game. Practice. For covenant.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures in the koozie, blindfolded, tangled but steady. The pillar sways faintly, like breath. No empire. No score. Only touch and trust.

Narration (your voice):
“Once, games were trials. But in the dark, in touch, they became play. Not tests of control — proofs of covenant.”

Fade out.
End of Season 22.
