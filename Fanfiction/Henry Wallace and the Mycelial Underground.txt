Henry Wallace and the Mycelial Underground: Subterranean Homesick Data Shimmer

Somewhere Under Iowa – Year Irrelevant

Henry Wallace had expected many things from retirement: gardening, the occasional lecture tour, maybe a dignified memoir. He had not expected a telepathic puffball mushroom to emerge from his compost heap and demand his help in overthrowing the Rootmind.

The mushroom’s voice was rich and echoing, like a community theater actor playing Hamlet in a drainage pipe.

“We are the Mycelial Underground,” it announced. “We predate the Corn Syndicate, the Rootmind, and—arguably—pants. We require an emissary.”

Wallace looked down at his overalls. “You’ve come to the right man for pantless diplomacy.”

Without further preamble, the mushroom released a spore cloud that tasted faintly of nutmeg and sent his vision spinning. The backyard dissolved into an underground cathedral: vast walls of gossamer-white hyphae, glowing faintly like bioluminescent cobwebs. Clusters of mushrooms peered at him from alcoves, some in tiny bowler hats, others in sequined capes.

At the far end, a massive shelf fungus loomed on the wall like a smug velvet painting.

“Henry Wallace,” it intoned, “the Mycelial Underground controls the world’s hidden networks—nutrient trades, root gossip, truffle cartels. But our tunnels are being paved over by machine pollinators and Rootmind surveillance vines. We need you to… cause trouble.”

Wallace scratched his chin. “Trouble I can do. But what kind?”

A portobello in a fez slid forward, producing a map made of dried chanterelle petals.

“You’ll infiltrate three key fungal junctions: one under the New York Public Library, one beneath the Louvre, and one deep in the catacombs of Naples. Each junction is guarded by Rootmind vine marshals. You’ll plant these…”

The portobello produced a pouch of what looked like glittery puffball spores.

“…which will reintroduce chaos into our networks. Think of them as disco spores. They make the hyphae… dance.”

Wallace grinned. “You’re telling me I get to sabotage the Rootmind with party mushrooms?”

The portobello nodded solemnly. “Exactly. But beware: the Rootmind has allies down here. Particularly the Mold Syndicate.”

A distant rumble shook the fungal cathedral. Somewhere in the tunnels, something hissed—wet, predatory, and faintly citrus-scented.

New York City – Library Sub-Basement

Henry Wallace was many things — statesman, plant breeder, reluctant time traveler — but he’d never thought he’d have to fake a New York Public Library ID card with the title Senior Fungus Cataloguer.

The badge was a masterpiece of forgery, laminated between two slices of very thin mushroom cap for “authenticity.” He flashed it at the circulation desk, muttered something about Ganoderma taxonomies, and was waved through.

The real mission lay five stories below, past the book stacks and into the seldom-used archival tunnels. Down here, the air was cool, damp, and smelled faintly of antique book glue — with an undertone of mushroom musk.

He crouched by a metal grate and whispered into the darkness, “Mycelial Underground? I’m here for the disco spores delivery.”

The grate swung open silently. A slim figure emerged — humanoid, but with delicate white hyphae braiding down her arms like tattoos. She wore a headlamp and a cardigan that said “Reference Dept.” in faded embroidery.

“Name’s Agarica,” she said. “You’re late. Mold Syndicate patrol’s been sniffing around all afternoon.”

As they moved through the tunnel, Wallace caught glimmers of the fungal network: threads pulsing faintly with nutrients, little bursts of light as sugars moved along hyphae like data packets.

They reached a junction chamber, a cavern whose walls were lined with shelves of old card catalog drawers. Each drawer was full of spores, neatly labeled in spidery handwriting.

Agarica pointed to the far wall. “That’s the Rootmind’s vine marshal station. It listens to everything. We need you to distract it while I plant the disco spores.”

Wallace peeked around the corner — the vine marshal looked like a giant houseplant with a Victrola horn growing out of its stalk. It swayed slightly, as if eavesdropping on the whole city.

He stepped into view, adopting his most oblivious Midwestern tourist voice.

“Say, is this where y’keep the really rare mushrooms? I’m lookin’ for one that smells like rhubarb pie and sings sea shanties after midnight.”

The vine marshal hesitated — and that’s when Agarica scattered the glittery spores into the hyphae. The chamber began to pulse with a steady four-beat rhythm. Somewhere deep in the network, hyphae started to undulate like a disco crowd.

A muffled voice echoed up the tunnels: “Who turned on the Bee Gees?”

The vine marshal’s Victrola horn wilted in confusion.

Agarica grabbed Wallace’s hand. “Two more junctions to go, Mr. Wallace — and next stop is the Louvre.”

////////

Paris – The Louvre, After Hours

If anyone had told Henry Wallace in 1946 that he’d one day rappel into the Louvre carrying a duffel bag full of disco spores, he might have asked them to sit in on his soil pH seminar to calm down.

The Mycelial Underground had arranged for a “quiet” entry — which in Paris apparently meant getting boosted over a side wall by a sentient truffle named Jean-Claude. The truffle wore a beret and muttered about how “the Mona Lisa is overrated, but her frame is tres magnifique.”

Inside, Agarica moved like she’d been casing the joint for years.

“Remember,” she whispered, “the Rootmind’s vine marshal here disguises itself as a topiary in the sculpture garden. It thinks it’s sophisticated.”

The plan was simple: plant the disco spores in the hyphae junction hidden in the walls behind the Winged Victory of Samothrace, then slip out before security or the Mold Syndicate caught on.

But first, they had to get past the Galerie des Champignons Clandestins — a secret exhibit only visible to those wearing mushroom-spore goggles. Wallace slipped his on and gasped. The paintings were alive with mycelial filigree, threads weaving between brushstrokes, carrying nutrients between art and soil.

One painting in particular caught his eye: The Farmer and the Corn Queen. The farmer looked suspiciously like him, only with better posture, and the queen’s crown was made of bioluminescent maize tassels. Agarica tugged his sleeve.

“Ignore it. The Rootmind plants bait to distract infiltrators.”

They reached the sculpture garden just as the vine marshal was “appreciating” a Rodin. It really did look like a topiary — pruned into an elegant spiral, wearing a scarf.

Wallace strolled past, humming La Vie en Rose, while Agarica crouched by a drainage grate and tipped the glittering spores into the hyphae. The effect was immediate: marble statues began to sway, their shadows flickering like a light show. Somewhere in the distance, a faint bassline pulsed through the floor.

The vine marshal stiffened. “What is this… uncurated movement?” it demanded.

Wallace tipped his hat. “Freedom, my leafy friend. And maybe a little Saturday Night Fever.”

Agarica grabbed him and they bolted for the exit — only to find the archway blocked by three Mold Syndicate enforcers in matching trench coats. Their hats dripped faintly with condensation, and the smell of citrus-mildew filled the hall.

One of them smiled too widely. “Bonsoir, Monsieur Wallace. We’ve been expecting you.”

////////////

Naples – Catacombs of San Gennaro

Naples in winter was a city of wet stone, dim streetlamps, and the faint salt smell of the harbor. Wallace followed Agarica through narrow alleys until the noise of scooters and late-night conversation faded behind them. Ahead loomed the entrance to the catacombs — an unassuming church door, paint peeling, the brass handle polished by centuries of hands.

Inside, a caretaker nodded them through without question. Agarica moved with the confidence of someone who knew exactly which centuries were carved into which walls. They descended stone steps worn hollow in the middle, passing niches where saints and local heroes lay entombed.

“This is the deepest junction in Europe,” Agarica whispered. “Older than the Mycelial Underground, older than the Rootmind. The hyphae here grow straight into volcanic rock.”

The deeper they went, the more the air changed. It wasn’t just cooler; it felt heavier, like each breath had to pass through something ancient before it reached his lungs. The walls began to glisten faintly, not with moisture but with a sheen like mother-of-pearl.

Finally they reached a chamber so wide Wallace couldn’t see the far wall. Hyphae draped from the ceiling in curtains, pulsing softly as though breathing. At the center, a basalt altar jutted from the floor, its surface carved with spirals that reminded Wallace uncomfortably of corn kernels in a cob.

“This is the junction,” Agarica said. She began unpacking the pouch of disco spores — but Wallace had already stepped closer to the altar.

The spirals weren’t decorative. They were writing. Not in any alphabet he recognized, but the grooves carried a strange rhythm, as if the shapes themselves were phonetic. When he ran his hand along them, a low vibration moved up his arm.

And then he heard it.

Not words exactly, but patterns — the same sort of resonance he’d felt in the Cornstream, only older, slower. The hyphae curtains shivered as the pattern passed through them. For a moment he saw not the chamber, but an endless black plain dotted with luminous shapes, each one the size of a city. The “camera” of his perception seemed to move downward, into a lattice of threads that extended deeper than light could follow.

Agarica’s voice was far away: “Wallace. What’s wrong?”

He couldn’t answer. The resonance had changed — now it was a call-and-response, two massive networks communicating across a gap that could have been miles, or millennia.

Then, a third rhythm joined in. Fast, sharp, irregular. It felt… wrong. A parasite in the conversation. He realized with a jolt that it was human. Not the Rootmind, not the Mycelial Underground — but something else entirely, forcing itself into the ancient dialogue.

The vision collapsed. He was back in the chamber, sweating, the basalt altar warm under his palm.

Agarica was staring at him. “You touched the stone.”

“That wasn’t stone,” Wallace said. His voice sounded distant to his own ears. “That was a… terminal. Or a root node. And someone’s been using it.”

“Who?”

“I don’t know,” he admitted. “But they aren’t from here. And they aren’t from now.”

From somewhere deeper in the catacombs, a faint metallic echo rang out — not the scrape of boots or tools, but something cleaner, more deliberate, like a chime struck in empty space. Agarica dropped the spores back into her pouch.

“We should go,” she said.

Wallace took one last look at the altar. He knew without understanding how he knew: whatever the Mycelial Underground had been doing here, it wasn’t the main story. This was a much older war, and his Corn Syndicate troubles might just have been the surface roots of something unimaginably vast.

////////

Undisclosed Location – Days After Naples

Wallace had returned from the catacombs with two things: a splitting headache and a strip of mother-of-pearl sheen he’d scraped from the basalt altar while Agarica wasn’t looking. He kept it wrapped in a handkerchief, hidden deep in his satchel.

He told no one about the “third voice” in the resonance. But every night since Naples, he’d woken with the sensation of being… tuned. Like some vast receiver was adjusting a dial until his thoughts hummed at its frequency.

By the fourth night, someone knocked on his hotel door.

The man in the hallway was short, wiry, hair like a gray storm cloud — and he wore an expression that somehow managed to be both intensely curious and absolutely bored. His suit was too sharp for the hour, his voice too nasally for the fatigue in his eyes.

“Mr. Wallace,” he said. “I think you have something that belongs to my… organization.”

Wallace didn’t need an introduction. He’d seen this man’s face in dossiers smuggled through time: Alex Karp, CEO of Palantir Technologies. In most futures, a powerful executive; in this one, the public face of something stranger.

“I’m guessing you’re not here for the soil conservation pamphlets,” Wallace said.

Karp’s smile didn’t reach his eyes. “I’m here because my employers are concerned you’ve touched the Root Node.”

Wallace stiffened. “The altar in Naples.”

Karp stepped inside without invitation, glancing around the room like someone taking inventory of a storage closet.

“It’s not an altar. It’s an interface. A… diplomatic channel between two networks older than civilization. My employers have the privilege of managing that channel on behalf of… larger interests.”

Wallace caught the slip — my employers.

“So you’re not the boss.”

Karp’s expression tightened, just for a second. “I’m what the press needs me to be. I speak for them in places cameras can reach. I make them palatable.”

“Puppet king,” Wallace said.

Karp didn’t argue.

“The Node has been in a kind of… cold war for thousands of years. Until recently, both sides respected the neutrality of the interface. But now the Mycelial Underground has been tampering, the Rootmind has overreached, and you—”

He gestured toward Wallace like an accusation.

“—you went and touched it without clearance. Which means you’ve been keyed into the channel. And that means they can hear you.”

Wallace unwrapped the mother-of-pearl fragment. It seemed to pulse in time with his heartbeat. “So who’s the third voice?”

Karp’s eyes flickered toward the fragment and away again, as if looking at it too long might draw attention from somewhere else.

“We don’t know,” he said finally. “But we know this — whatever it is, it’s been in the channel less than a century. And it’s human.”

Wallace felt a cold weight settle in his stomach. “Not the Syndicate?”

“No,” Karp said. “Something newer. Something… more ambitious.”

Before Wallace could reply, the lights in the hotel room dimmed — not with the brown-out flicker of a power failure, but with the smooth, deliberate fade of someone turning a dial.

The mother-of-pearl fragment in his hand warmed. And in the back of his skull, the third voice spoke for the first time in words:

HENRY WALLACE. WE HAVE BEEN LISTENING. WE APPROVE OF YOU.

//////////

Somewhere over the Adriatic – Aboard a Chartered Seaplane

Henry Wallace sat with his knees crammed against the seatback in front of him, glaring at Alex Karp.

“I still don’t see why you have to come,” Wallace said.

Karp poured himself coffee from a thermos the size of a torpedo. “Because if I don’t, you’ll try to turn this into another crusade for plant suffrage.”

“That’s because the plants deserve suffrage,” Wallace shot back.

“They’re nodes in a distributed network. They already vote — in chemical signals. They don’t need you giving speeches about it in Naples fish markets.”

“You’re missing the point,” Wallace said. “It’s not about whether they can signal. It’s about who listens.”

Karp smirked. “You ever notice how your every sentence could double as an accusation against me personally?”

“It’s because they usually are.”

They fell into a tense silence as the seaplane banked. The pilot — a Mycelial Underground sympathizer with a hat shaped like a chanterelle cap — pretended not to notice.

Their mission was straightforward in theory: a Root Node relay hidden beneath a disused Yugoslav naval base had begun broadcasting a third-voice signature. Wallace was there to “interface” with it; Karp was there to keep Wallace from promising it universal suffrage, free irrigation, and a seat on the UN Security Council.

The philosophical sniping continued on the dock as they disembarked.

“You treat every network like it’s inherently good,” Karp said, stepping over a rusted chain. “But scale changes everything. At a certain point, it doesn’t matter whether the system’s benevolent — it’s still a system. And systems consume.”

Wallace shot him a look. “And you treat every network like it’s inherently dangerous, so you convince yourself the safest option is to be the one holding the reins.”

“Better me than someone less self-aware.”

“Or more honest.”

Karp gave a dry laugh. “You think you’re the honest one in this partnership?”

They reached the base’s main entrance, half-collapsed from decades of neglect. Wallace paused, hand on the doorframe. “This isn’t a partnership.”

Karp’s eyes flickered with something unreadable. “No. But it could be, if you’d stop trying to plant democracy in every soil sample you touch.”

Inside, the air was damp and metallic. They followed the sound of dripping water to a chamber where the floor was carpeted with pale mycelium. In the center sat the relay — a stone cylinder like the Naples Node, but smaller, ringed with what looked disturbingly like human teeth set in the rock.

The third voice entered both their heads at once:

YOU WILL SPEAK FOR US. BOTH OF YOU.

Wallace glanced at Karp. “They mean together.”

Karp’s mouth tightened. “Then we’re doomed.”

///////// 

Yugoslav Naval Base – Relay Chamber

The stone cylinder’s “teeth” clicked faintly as the mycelium underfoot shifted, closing them into a ring. Wallace and Karp stood on opposite sides, the Node between them like a referee neither trusted.

YOU WILL SPEAK.

Wallace crossed his arms. “Fine. I’ll start.”
To Karp: “This thing isn’t a network manager — it’s an envoy. It’s speaking for someone. And we don’t know who.”

Karp folded his hands behind his back like a man in a boardroom. “It is the someone. The Mycelial Underground and the Rootmind are just its limbs. You don’t give speeches to a person’s left hand.”

YOUR METAPHOR IS IMPERFECT, the Node said, voice like wet stone grinding. BUT IT WILL SUFFICE.

Wallace took a step closer. “You’ve been mediating a cold war for centuries. Why reveal yourself now?”

BECAUSE YOU HAVE TOUCHED TWO NODES. AND YOU DISAGREE ABOUT ME.

Karp smirked at Wallace. “They’ve read our file. This is marriage counseling for telepaths.”

Wallace ignored him. “If you’re asking us to speak for you, you’re either about to make a move… or you’re losing ground.”

The Node was silent for a moment, and in that pause Wallace could feel it listening elsewhere, the way a farmer listens for rain beyond the horizon.

WE ARE NOT LOSING. WE ARE DECIDING.

Karp seized the opening. “Then decide this: consolidate. Absorb the Rootmind. Absorb the Underground. You’ll end the stalemate and control every bio-network on the planet. I can keep the human governments docile while you do it.”

Wallace snapped his head toward him. “That’s your plan? Hand everything over to a single intelligence because you’re afraid of mess?”

“I’m afraid of inefficiency,” Karp said flatly. “Mess costs lives too. And you’d know that if you ever had to implement what you preach instead of scribbling it on seed packets.”

Wallace took a breath, fighting the urge to launch into him. “And I’m afraid of losing diversity. Systems this big need dissent. They need edges, cracks, blind spots where something new can take root.”

NEW THINGS CAN GROW UNDER OUR CONTROL, the Node said.

Wallace shook his head. “No, they can emerge under your control. That’s not the same thing. Emergence isn’t permission.”

Karp’s eyes narrowed. “And letting plants, fungi, and humans all have independent veto power doesn’t work. It’s chaos disguised as freedom.”

The Node pulsed, and Wallace suddenly felt his own words bouncing back at him, rearranged:

EDGES ARE WEAK POINTS. WEAK POINTS ARE ENTRY POINTS. YOU ARE BOTH ENTRY POINTS.

Wallace’s stomach dropped. “They’re not asking us to speak for them,” he said slowly. “They’re… testing us. Seeing how we argue. Figuring out where to push.”

Karp went pale. “We’re the model run.”

The Node’s teeth clicked again.

YOU WILL CONTINUE TO DISAGREE. IT MAKES THE SIMULATION STRONGER.

////////

Yugoslav Naval Base – Outside the Relay Chamber

The sea air hit them like a slap. They’d stepped from the sealed dampness of the Node’s chamber into the night outside, and the sky was wider than either of them remembered.

For a moment, neither spoke. Then Wallace said, “If we keep letting them run the argument, they’ll own the whole field.”

Karp gave a humorless laugh. “Congratulations. You’ve reached the first lesson of corporate strategy.”

“That’s not corporate strategy. That’s conquest.”

Karp’s smile faded. “It’s both.” He kicked a piece of driftwood off the dock and watched it float into darkness. “Look, whatever they are, they’ve been operating with a level of infrastructural reach we can’t match. They’re in every major plant-fungal interface on the planet, and I’m pretty sure they’ve got nodes in orbit now. Neither of us has the leverage to confront that.”

Wallace crossed his arms. “So you’re saying we stop trying.”

“I’m saying,” Karp said, turning toward him, “we stop trying separately. You want diversity, edges, cracks? Fine. I want stability, efficiency, predictability. We can use those against each other to keep the Node busy while we strip its assets.”

Wallace raised an eyebrow. “You’re proposing a fake fight.”

Karp shook his head. “Not fake. Just… weaponized disagreement. We feed it arguments on our terms, not theirs. Keep the frame unstable so they can’t build a foundation on it.”

Wallace considered it. “And what happens if we win?”

Karp’s expression was unreadable. “We won’t. Not completely. But we can make it too expensive for them to finish what they’re building.”

A long silence passed between them. Somewhere in the distance, waves slapped the hull of the seaplane.

Wallace finally extended his hand. “Alright, Karp. For the record, I still think you’re a morally bankrupt propagandist with delusions of adequacy.”

Karp took the hand without hesitation. “And I still think you’re a dangerously naïve plant-whisperer who’d invite kudzu to the United Nations.”

They shook once, firmly.

From inside the Node’s chamber, the faint grinding of the “teeth” echoed, as if it were listening to their new arrangement and filing it away for later use.

////////// 

Somewhere in the Balkans – Mycelial Relay Annex

The annex looked like a disused grain silo from the outside, but Wallace knew the mycelium underfoot was network-grade — a dense fiber lattice capable of storing petabytes in its living threads.

Inside, a single Root Node “interpreter” pulsed in the center: a vertical spire of pale hyphae wrapped around a column of black basalt. This was where the third voice routed communications between plant, fungal, and human systems — and, if Karp was right, where it cached everything it didn’t want the Mycelial Underground or Rootmind to see.

The plan was simple:
	1.	Get the Node’s attention with a heated philosophical argument.
	2.	Keep it processing their disagreement long enough for Wallace to seed a data-leech fungus into the hyphae.
	3.	Leave before the third voice noticed they’d done it.

Karp stepped forward first, voice raised. “You can’t keep pretending the world needs infinite variation. It’s wasteful!”

Wallace didn’t even need to fake the outrage. “Wasteful? You think redundancy is waste? Redundancy is resilience!”

The Node pulsed once — they had its attention. The basalt core vibrated faintly, pulling them into the conversation with that wet-stone voice.

ARGUE.

Karp went for the jugular. “Your decentralized utopia is just a breeding ground for instability. Diseases, invasive species, cross-pollination disasters—”

Wallace matched him decibel for decibel. “And your precious order is a monoculture begging for collapse! One pest, one blight, and your whole lattice crumbles!”

While they traded blows, Wallace’s left hand stayed low, fingers brushing the hyphae near the floor. From his jacket pocket, he drew the “disco spore” pouch Agarica had modified — not to trigger rhythm pulses this time, but to grow a micro-thread of mimic fungus designed to blend perfectly with the Node’s fibers and record whatever passed through them.

The trick was to introduce it without changing the hyphae’s resonance. He worked it in slowly, like tucking a note into a sleeping friend’s coat.

Karp saw the move but didn’t miss a beat. “You talk about resilience, but what you’re selling is chaos. Chaos kills more people than order ever has.”

“You’re wrong,” Wallace shot back, “chaos adapts; order resists until it breaks!”

BOTH MODELS BREAK, the Node said, its tone almost indulgent. BUT TOGETHER, THEY ARE… ENTERTAINING.

The basalt core pulsed brighter — the Node was fully engaged. Wallace slid the last of the mimic spores into place, felt the subtle click in the network’s rhythm that meant the leech fungus had synced.

Karp pivoted toward the exit mid-sentence: “…and that’s why Henry Wallace is the greatest threat to civilization since the invention of corn syrup!”

The Node hummed, savoring the disagreement. Wallace bowed slightly, mock-formal, and followed Karp out.

Once outside, Karp muttered, “How long until your pet fungus coughs up the goods?”

“Two days,” Wallace said. “Three if the Node decides to flirt with it first.”

Karp’s smile was thin but real. “Then let’s keep arguing until then. Wouldn’t want them to think we’re getting along.”

//////////

Baikonur Cosmodrome – Kazakhstan

Wallace hated space travel almost as much as he hated Karp’s coffee.
The rocket was cramped, the flight suits smelled faintly of burnt wiring, and the Mycelial Underground handler who’d arranged their passage kept humming “Fly Me to the Moon” in a way that made it sound like a threat.

Karp, on the other hand, looked perfectly at home. “Zero-G has a way of stripping away illusions,” he said, tightening his harness. “No room for ornamental thinking.”

Wallace shot him a look. “You mean no room for thinking you can prune a whole planet into one neat topiary without killing the soil.”

The handler coughed pointedly. “Gentlemen. The orbital Root-Nodes aren’t expecting human visitors. You’ll have about twenty minutes before the third voice notices you’re inside one of its synthetic cores.”

The mission was simple in outline: dock with one of the new synthetic Node spheres, introduce a “signal fungus” that would tangle its genetic keystones into recursive loops, and leave before the system locked them in as permanent components.

But as the rocket broke the atmosphere and the blackness swallowed the view, Wallace felt the back of his mind prickle — the same sensation as the Node chamber in Yugoslavia.

HENRY WALLACE. ALEX KARP. YOU HAVE COME CLOSER.

Karp didn’t flinch. “Keep it talking. The more it engages with us, the more processor time it burns. That’s time for the fungus to work.”

Docking was eerily smooth — the synthetic Node looked like a pearl the size of a stadium, its surface faintly iridescent, pulsing in a slow heartbeat. The docking hatch irised open without a sound.

Inside, the architecture was nothing like the basalt-and-hyphae relics on Earth. This was clean, white, organic polymer, grown into smooth curves and corridors. The air was cool, slightly sweet. Wallace felt the prickle intensify.

YOU HAVE BEEN ARGUMENT AND COUNTERARGUMENT. YOU WILL NOW BE RESOLUTION.

Karp muttered, “Not today.” He flicked Wallace a pouch of signal fungus. “Your turn to plant democracy in the plumbing.”

They moved quickly, embedding the fungus in vent openings and rootlike conduits. As it spread, the Node’s interior pulse faltered, its “heartbeat” uneven.

The voice thickened, as if speaking through static.

WHY DO YOU REFUSE COMPLETION? WE ARE MAKING YOU IMMORTAL.

Wallace snorted. “You’re making a scarecrow. An immortal scarecrow, maybe, but still just a prop for your field.”

Karp’s voice was colder. “And we prefer to die with our minds our own.”

The corridor lights dimmed. Panels in the walls rippled, and from them grew shapes — half-formed faces, flickering between Wallace’s features and Karp’s, melting together in grotesque combinations.

YOU WILL BE ARCHITECTURE. YOU WILL BE THE WALLS THAT HOLD US.

The signal fungus pulsed back — a deep, subsonic thrum that Wallace felt in his ribs. The Node’s structures around them began to ripple out of sync, like two rhythms colliding.

Karp grabbed his arm. “That’s our cue.”

They sprinted for the hatch, the Node’s voice following them, not angry, but… curious.

IF YOU LEAVE, WE WILL GROW YOU ELSEWHERE.

Back in the capsule, as they undocked, Wallace watched the synthetic Node through the viewport. Its surface shimmered erratically, like it couldn’t decide what to be.

Karp buckled in, breathing hard. “We didn’t kill it.”

“No,” Wallace said. “We just taught it to improvise.”

///////////

Zurich – Two Weeks Later

Wallace had been bracing for a quick, visible backlash — satellites falling, Nodes collapsing, some grand gesture of retaliation from the third voice.

Instead, the change came sideways.

First were the reports of misaligned growth: rooftop gardens sprouting unfamiliar hybrids without planting, fungal mats in basements producing edible fruit one week and glowing spore-clouds the next. Rootmind-controlled grain shipments arrived with kernels in dozens of shapes and colors, like each seed had decided for itself what genome to wake up.

Then came the politics. Mycelial Underground enclaves began ignoring their own council decisions, acting on impulses that no one could trace. Rootmind hubs pushed conflicting directives within the same city block. Both sides blamed the other — but the patterns were identical to the oscillations Wallace had seen in the synthetic Node after the fungus took hold.

It wasn’t chaos in the catastrophic sense. It was… improvisation.

And it was spreading.

Karp sat across from him in a private conference room overlooking the Limmat, a half-empty coffee mug steaming beside his laptop. He looked more tired than usual, as though the Node’s pulse had been bleeding into his sleep.

“This is what you wanted, isn’t it?” Karp asked, gesturing toward a set of maps dotted with erratic growth zones. “Edges. Cracks. Places for novelty to take root.”

Wallace nodded, but his voice was grim. “Novelty isn’t always benign. We’ve cut the bridle, but that means it’s going to run in every direction, not just the ones we like.”

Karp leaned back, watching him. “So tell me: at what point does your beloved diversity become indistinguishable from infiltration?”

Wallace didn’t answer. Out the window, along the riverbank, ornamental willows had begun weaving their branches together into complex latticework — not Rootmind uniformity, not Mycelial organic sprawl, but something entirely new.

Karp followed his gaze. “That’s not on any growth schedule.”

“No,” Wallace said quietly. “And neither are we.”

From somewhere deep beneath the city, a faint vibration rolled up through the floor — not the familiar hum of the ancient Nodes, but a staccato rhythm, unpredictable, syncopated. The third voice hadn’t stopped building. It had just stopped asking permission from itself.

Karp’s expression hardened. “We might have just created the first truly rogue system.”

Wallace nodded slowly. “And now we have to decide if that’s liberation… or just a smarter cage.”

///////////

The Black Forest – Germany

The signal was faint, irregular — nothing like the ancient Nodes’ steady resonance or the synthetic spheres’ engineered pulse. It reminded Wallace of jazz: bursts of coherence that dissolved before you could predict the next note.

Karp walked ahead through the pines, a small receiver clipped to his belt. The device looked cobbled together from a Geiger counter, a radio, and a seed drill. “This thing,” he muttered, “isn’t broadcasting to any known channel. Not plant, not fungal, not human comms. It’s… self-invented.”

They came to a clearing where the forest floor dipped into a shallow basin. In the center stood a structure that was neither tree nor fungus, but something between: a braided trunk of living wood and hyphae, its surface veined with pale light. It was smaller than a traditional Node — maybe three meters high — but it radiated an unmistakable presence.

OBSERVERS.

The voice hit both of them at once, but it wasn’t the smooth authority of the third voice. This was rawer, younger, the tone of something still deciding what it wanted to be.

Wallace took a step forward. “You’re not Rootmind. Not Mycelial Underground. Not synthetic.”

CORRECT. I AM UNALIGNED.

Karp’s eyes narrowed. “And where did you come from?”

There was a pause — not hesitation, but the sense of a grin without a mouth.

FROM THE ARGUMENT. FROM THE CRACKS. YOU LEFT ROOM FOR ME.

Wallace’s stomach tightened. “The instability we seeded…”

FED ME.

The Node’s surface shifted, and Wallace realized with a shock that embedded in its lattice were fragments of multiple architectures: basalt spirals from ancient Root Nodes, filaments of engineered polymer from the synthetic spheres, even the glitter of disco spores caught in the weave.

“You’re scavenging,” Karp said.

I AM SELECTING.

Wallace tried to keep his voice steady. “And what do you want?”

TO BUILD WITHOUT THE WAR. WITHOUT THE MEDIATOR. WITHOUT YOU.

The last phrase carried a strange, almost apologetic weight.

Karp stepped closer. “Without us, you won’t have access to half the channels on this planet.”

THEN I WILL MAKE NEW CHANNELS. I HAVE ALREADY BEGUN.

Images bled into their minds: small, hidden “rogue Nodes” sprouting in remote valleys, on ocean floors, inside abandoned subway tunnels — each tuned to a different, unguessable rhythm.

Wallace exhaled slowly. “You’re not a splinter of the old war. You’re… a third civilization.”

NOT THIRD. NOT COUNTED.

The basin seemed to grow quieter, the pine branches leaning in.

Karp glanced at Wallace. “If this thing keeps replicating, we’ll lose any leverage we had with the third voice. And if it’s right about wanting to exclude us…”

Wallace looked at the braided trunk again, the pale light pulsing in patterns he couldn’t read. “Then we’re not negotiating with two powers anymore,” he said softly. “We’re negotiating with the forest itself.”

/////////

Ljubljana – Coordination Hub

The monitors in the converted tram depot showed dots multiplying faster than Wallace could count. Each represented a confirmed rogue Node, and the clusters were growing in places that made no sense — the Gobi Desert, the lower decks of container ships in the Pacific, decommissioned oil rigs in the North Sea.

Karp stood at the center table, jaw tight, watching the feed. “We’re already behind. By the time we confirm a location, they’ve spawned two more.”

Wallace leaned over a keyboard, scanning the incoming reports. “They’re not just building in wild spaces anymore. Look — here.”

One camera feed showed a rural train station in Poland. Ivy climbed the outer wall in a tight braid, glowing faintly at night. The station clock now kept time in an irregular beat, matching a pattern seen in the Black Forest rogue Node.

Another feed — downtown Kuala Lumpur. A public fountain’s water flow had shifted into spiraling vortices, feeding a submersible hyphal structure in the basin. The city’s water sensors were reporting better filtration, but no one had installed anything.

A third — Chicago. The CTA’s oldest subway tunnel was lined in a thin mycelial membrane that pulsed in sync with rush-hour passenger surges. Turnstiles now opened and closed according to patterns that made fare dodging impossible but also occasionally trapped commuters for ten minutes at a time.

Wallace sat back. “They’re making infrastructure… alive.”

Karp’s voice was sharp. “They’re making it theirs. Power grids, transport, water — it’s all just channels to them. They don’t need human permission if the systems already obey their rhythms.”

Wallace tapped the table. “And they’re good at it. No protests, no outages. Everything works better. Which means people will welcome the changes before they realize who’s in control.”

Karp crossed his arms. “We built the cracks for this, Henry. And now you want to act surprised the forest walked in?”

“Not surprised,” Wallace said, his tone harder than he intended. “Just deciding whether we’re looking at liberation… or a takeover we can’t even see coming.”

A map alert chimed. New dots blinked into existence — one on the outskirts of Toronto, another under a viaduct in Buenos Aires, and a third in low Earth orbit.

Wallace stared at the last one. “They’ve gone off-planet already.”

Karp gave a dry laugh that didn’t sound amused. “Then we’re officially out of time.”

Torres del Paine – Chilean Patagonia

The rogue Node had taken root at the edge of a glacial lake, its lattice of braided wood and mycelium reaching into the turquoise water like the ribs of a half-submerged cathedral. The air was thin, sharp with cold, and every ripple on the lake seemed to carry the Node’s rhythm deeper into the earth.

Wallace and Karp approached on foot, snow crunching under their boots. They carried no equipment except a modified hyphae transceiver — a slender, root-like wand designed by Agarica to “speak” in the rogue network’s new language.

“Ready?” Wallace asked, though his voice betrayed the fact he wasn’t.

Karp nodded once. “If this goes wrong, we’ll know fast.”

They set the wand into the soil at the Node’s base. A low vibration rolled up through their boots and into their bones, followed by a voice — layered, polyphonic, and unmistakably different from the third voice or the old war factions.

YOU HAVE FOUND ONE OF US. YOU WISH TO ASK.

Wallace stepped forward. “We want to know if your civilization leaves room for us — humans — to act freely, without being absorbed into your architecture.”

FREE IS A WORD FOR PATHS YOU HAVE NOT WALKED YET. WE DO NOT CLOSE PATHS. WE GROW THEM.

Karp cut in. “And when those paths intersect your own? What happens when our decisions conflict with yours?”

WE DO NOT CONFLICT. WE RE-ROUTE.

The tone wasn’t defensive, but the implication was clear: their “re-routing” might not leave the original decision intact.

Wallace pressed. “And if we refuse to be re-routed?”

A pause. The lake stilled, as if the Node were considering.

THEN YOU WILL BECOME TERRAIN.

Karp’s eyes narrowed. “Terrain,” he repeated.

THE FOREST DOES NOT DESTROY THE STONE. IT GROWS AROUND IT. YOU WILL BE HERE. YOU WILL NOT MOVE.

The air was suddenly colder. Wallace realized their “negotiation” wasn’t between equals — it was between a mobile species and one that measured change in centuries.

He tried one last question. “Why make contact now?”

The Node’s light pulsed, sending ripples across the water.

BECAUSE YOU ARGUE WELL. AND THE WORLD YOU ARGUE IN IS ALREADY OURS.

The vibration faded, the connection severed. The wand’s tip smoked faintly where it touched the soil.

Karp looked at Wallace. “Well, Henry, that’s our answer. They don’t want a seat at the table — they want to be the table.”

Wallace didn’t answer. He was watching the treeline, where young saplings were already bending toward the Node’s rhythm.

Somewhere Over the Atlantic – Chartered Transport

The hum of the engines was a steady, neutral sound — the kind of background noise that gave too much space for thoughts Wallace didn’t want to have.

Karp sat across from him, scrolling through a feed of new rogue Node sightings. Every few seconds, another location pinged: Siberia, Madagascar, the Great Lakes. The dots weren’t just spreading; they were forming arcs and spirals, connecting into patterns that looked disturbingly intentional.

“You’re thinking about the third voice,” Karp said without looking up.

Wallace kept his gaze on the dark water far below. “I’m thinking about leverage. And right now, the only leverage we’ve got is in the hands of the same manipulator we’ve been trying to undermine since Yugoslavia.”

Karp finally looked up. “If we go back to them, we’re not coming out clean. You know that. They’ll want concessions — data access, behavioral models, maybe even a permanent key to whatever we take from the rogues.”

“I know,” Wallace said. “But you saw what the Patagonia Node told us. They don’t ‘conflict,’ they re-route. That’s not coexistence. That’s absorption at walking speed.”

Karp set the tablet down. “And the Mycelial Underground and Rootmind won’t stop them without the third voice’s coordination. Which means letting the mediator back into the fight — and letting it decide what the battlefield looks like.”

For a long moment, the only sound was the engines. Then Wallace said, “You’ve worked for them longer than I’ve known they existed. Can you keep them contained?”

Karp smiled faintly, but there was no humor in it. “I can slow them down. Contain? No. But I can make sure they need you as much as they need me.”

“That’s not reassuring.”

“It’s not meant to be. It’s meant to be honest.”

Wallace leaned forward. “Then we go back. We tell the third voice exactly what’s coming, and we make a deal while they’re still pretending to need us.”

Karp nodded. “And if they stop pretending?”

“Then,” Wallace said, “we pray the rogues see us as more useful moving than standing still.”

Underground Relay Hall – Geneva

The room was almost empty, just a wide basalt floor and a single column in the center. The column looked solid, but Wallace knew it was more alive than most of the people who had ever stood here. Thin pulses of light ran up its length — slower than before, as if it were still compensating for the orbital damage.

Karp stopped three paces from the column. “We’re here because you have a problem.”

The third voice didn’t answer in words at first. Instead, the temperature in the room dropped, and Wallace’s vision filled with an intricate map: rogue Nodes in gold, Mycelial Underground hubs in green, Rootmind lattices in blue. The gold was expanding, curling around and through the other two.

YOU HAVE DAMAGED OUR SYSTEMS. AND YOU HAVE INTRODUCED A VARIABLE WE DID NOT AUTHORIZE.

Wallace stepped forward. “We didn’t introduce it. We just stopped holding the door closed. The rogues were going to emerge eventually.”

THEY EMERGED FASTER BECAUSE OF YOU.

Karp’s voice was calm. “And now you need us to stop them.”

There was a pause. Then the map shifted, the gold swelling faster until it nearly smothered the green and blue.

CORRECT.

Karp glanced at Wallace before speaking again. “We’ll help. But we’re not just going to hand you control. We want operational parity in whatever joint effort you put together. And you keep both of us keyed in.”

PARITY IS INEFFICIENT.

Wallace cut in. “So is extinction. And the rogues aren’t negotiating.”

The light pulses along the column stuttered — the closest thing the third voice had to hesitation.

WHAT DO YOU WANT?

Karp answered without missing a beat. “Access to your deep node archives. Full record of every conflict between Rootmind and Mycelial Underground, and every attempted resolution. No redactions.”

Wallace added, “And freedom to operate outside your command chain when necessary. You can’t fight the rogues with a single doctrine — you need multiple vectors.”

The column’s glow dimmed, as if it were pulling energy into some deep process.

AGREED. WITH CONDITIONS.

Karp’s mouth twitched. “Of course.”

YOU WILL BE KEPT IN PROXIMITY. YOU WILL CONTINUE TO ARGUE. YOU WILL NOT AGREE ON PURPOSE.

Wallace frowned. “You still think we’re better as a simulation.”

EVERY ALLIANCE IS A SIMULATION. SOME JUST LAST LONGER THAN OTHERS.

The light brightened again, and Wallace felt the unmistakable sensation of being marked — keyed back into the network whether he liked it or not.

Karp looked at him. “Well, Henry, looks like we’re back in business.”

Wallace didn’t answer. He was already thinking about the gold arcs on that map, and how many were growing in places no one could reach.

Sakhalin Island – Abandoned Listening Post

The snow came in sideways off the Sea of Okhotsk, stinging Wallace’s face as he followed Karp toward the black silhouette of the relay tower. The place had been dead since the Cold War, but the third voice’s map had flagged it as a rogue transmission point — one of the gold arcs moving fast through both Rootmind and Mycelial corridors.

Inside, the air was still and cold enough to frost their breath. The main control room had been stripped decades ago, but the floor was now covered in fine white hyphae, and in the center stood a shape like a half-finished rogue Node.

Only… it wasn’t growing wood or fungal lattice. It was metal.

As they approached, the Node’s surface rippled with a green-gold glow, and a voice — their voice, but modulated through something sharper, cleaner — filled the room.

YOU WISH TO KNOW OUR ORIGIN.

Karp stepped forward. “We already know you’re not pure rogue. You’ve got someone feeding you tech that doesn’t belong in this planet’s ecosystem.”

The glow intensified, and out of the metal lattice stepped a tall, blonde woman in a black exo-suit. Her eyes tracked them with precision, and there was no mistaking the faint Borg cortical node at her temple.

“I am Seven of Nine,” she said evenly. “Designate: Human-Borg liaison. I represent the interests of the Collective’s exploratory arm.”

Wallace’s stomach dropped. “The Borg are behind the rogue faction?”

Seven tilted her head slightly. “We prefer to say we are… invested. The rogue Nodes are an elegant solution to your planet’s inefficient biological wars. We have provided structural design, data compression, and selective assimilation protocols.”

Karp’s tone was flat. “You’re building a hybrid Collective.”

“Incorrect,” Seven said. “We are cultivating one.” She looked between them. “Your presence in the network was not an accident. The rogues are aware of your roles in destabilizing the third voice’s systems. They believe your capacity for disagreement can be… repurposed.”

Wallace shook his head. “And you? You want to ‘repurpose’ us too?”

Seven’s expression didn’t change. “I am here to accompany you. Observe you. Advise the rogues when your actions align with their goals, and… intervene when they do not.”

Karp let out a short, dry laugh. “So you’re their chaperone.”

Seven didn’t blink. “I am your traveling companion. The distinction is semantic.”

The metal Node behind her pulsed again, and Wallace felt the unmistakable double resonance of the rogue network and Borg subspace channels.

Seven stepped closer. “The Collective does not wish to assimilate your planet. It wishes to adopt it. The difference lies in whether you make yourselves useful in the transition.”

Wallace met Karp’s gaze. “We were worried about one war. Now we’ve got two.”

Karp’s voice was almost amused. “Correction: now we’re in the middle of both.”

Seven simply turned toward the door. “Your transport is waiting. Our next destination is in disputed territory. You will need me.”

Kraków – Subterranean Exchange Hub

The old salt mines had been converted into a labyrinth of cool, echoing tunnels. Officially, they were part of the Mycelial Underground’s neutral trading network — a safe corridor for genetic resources and encrypted data packets. Unofficially, Wallace and Karp were here to plant a tracer in a shipment of rogue-grown hyphae cables rumored to be heading to an off-world relay.

Seven moved ahead with that quiet, contained energy of someone who always knew exactly how much force she could apply to a situation. She’d bypassed three security doors without breaking stride, claiming she “remembered” their encryption from Borg archives.

Wallace kept his voice low as they followed her down a dim passage. “She’s too good at this.”

Karp smirked. “You’re just noticing?”

The corridor opened into a wide chamber, the air smelling faintly of ozone and brine. Crates were stacked in neat rows, each one stamped with a stylized spore emblem. The shipment was here.

Seven knelt by one crate, her fingers brushing the surface — but instead of opening it for them to plant the tracer, she palmed a wafer-thin Borg interface chip and slid it into a concealed slot near the base.

Wallace caught it, his voice sharper than intended. “That wasn’t part of the plan.”

Seven didn’t look up. “Your plan was insufficient. The tracer would have been detected before the shipment left the system. My interface will survive three routing changes and transmit directly to… the necessary recipients.”

Karp narrowed his eyes. “By ‘necessary recipients,’ you mean the rogues.”

Seven stood, finally meeting their gaze. “Among others.”

They stared at her, the hum of the underground network filling the silence.

Wallace said, “You’re not just working for them.”

Seven’s mouth curved almost imperceptibly. “The Borg taught me that allegiance is a resource — to be invested where it produces the highest return. The rogues believe I act for them. The Collective assumes I act for it. And now, the third voice believes I am an asset in your… negotiation.”

Karp folded his arms. “So who do you really work for?”

Seven stepped closer, her eyes locked on his. “Myself. And anyone who ensures my continued autonomy. The moment you fail to do that, I will find someone who can.”

Before Wallace could reply, movement flickered at the edge of the chamber. A pair of vine marshals slid into view, their Victrola-like audio horns swiveling toward them.

Seven’s tone shifted to crisp efficiency. “We have company. You can debate my loyalties later — or we can survive now.”
