Season 40, Episode 1: The Slingshot

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
A pile of scavenged wood branches, strips of bark, and bits of scavenged elastic sit in the dust. Still crouches like an eager engineer, Peter leans on his knees, Alex watches with a skeptical eye. Kellyn holds up a Y-shaped branch.

Kellyn (grinning):
“Behold: the ancient equalizer.”

Still (deadpan, precise):
“Approximate velocity at close range: enough to dent egos, not skulls.”

The others laugh.

Title Card: The Slingshot

⸻

Act I — The Carving
Knives and sharp stones scrape against wood. Alex smooths the handle of his branch, methodical as ever. Kellyn wraps bark cord around theirs, humming. Peter fumbles, snapping a twig, curses under his breath.

Peter (mutters):
“Precision was never my strength.”
Kellyn (teasing):
“That’s what Still is for.”

Still flashes a rare grin, already halfway finished with a perfectly symmetrical frame.

⸻

Act II — The Confession in Wood
As they work, the rhythm grows meditative. Alex breaks the quiet.

Karp (low, thoughtful):
“In empire, we built weapons to wound. To claim control. Here we’re making the same shape, but… for play. For balance.”

Peter exhales, sanding rough edges from his branch.

Peter (quiet, raw):
“I don’t know if I’ve ever made anything not meant to dominate. I don’t even know what that feels like.”

Kellyn (steady, warm):
“Feels like this. Like laughing when your elastic snaps and smacks your wrist. Like not needing to win.”

⸻

Act III — The First Shots
By afternoon, four slingshots are finished. They line up, facing a row of empty jars on a low wall.

Still goes first, dead-center hit.
Alex misses, adjusts, hits the second time.
Kellyn lets the pebble fly wild on purpose, laughing.
Peter hesitates, then finally shoots — his pebble bounces short, harmless.

Peter (grinning despite himself):
“Empire never taught me how to miss.”
Kellyn (smiling back):
“Good thing covenant did.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Play
They keep shooting until the jars are toppled, laughter mixing with ricochets. The sun sets golden over the courtyard.

Still (mock-serious):
“Victory condition: collective amusement achieved.”

Alex shakes his head, but he’s smiling. Peter sits on the wall, slingshot resting against his knee, looking almost light.

Kellyn (soft, to the group):
“We’ve all been weapons before. But now we can choose — tool, toy, covenant. Same wood, different hands.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four slingshots rest in the dust beside scattered jars. The courtyard glows with laughter and orange light — not a battlefield, not an empire, just a game.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Weapons don’t change their shape. But covenant changes the hands that hold them. Even the same branch can bend toward play.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 1.

⸻ 

Season 40, Episode 2: The Rope

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
A low table, a heap of dried grasses, bark strips, and scavenged fibers. The air is warm and still. Kellyn kneels, rolling strands against their thigh until they twist tight.

Kellyn (soft, wry):
“Everything falls apart without rope. And everything holds when you make it right.”

Peter watches, hesitant, a strip of bark in his hands.

Title Card: The Rope

⸻

Act I — The Twisting
The work begins: twisting, braiding, binding. Still moves with precision, making neat coils. Alex’s knots are practical, efficient. Kellyn hums softly, their hands quick and sure. Peter fumbles, fibers slipping loose.

Peter (grimacing):
“It looks simple. But it doesn’t… hold.”
Still (deadpan, encouraging):
“Neither did I, at first.”

The others chuckle gently.

⸻

Act II — The Confession in Fibers
As hands work, silence thickens. Then Alex speaks, low.

Karp:
“In empire, rope was always restraint. Binding. Holding until someone broke.”

Kellyn glances up, steady.

Kellyn:
“Empire always forgot the other side. Rope ties hammocks, shelters, bridges. Rope connects.”

Peter swallows, fingers shaking as he tries again.

Peter (hoarse):
“I only ever thought of it as a leash. Around my neck, around my choices. Maybe that’s why my knots keep failing.”

Kellyn (softly):
“Then make a knot that doesn’t choke. Make one that holds.”

⸻

Act III — The Learning
The sun dips lower. Slowly, Peter’s hands steady. His rope isn’t neat, but it holds. Still sets it beside the others, nodding.

Still:
“Strength isn’t only in symmetry. Sometimes it’s in persistence.”

Peter looks down at his rough coil, then up at Kellyn.

Peter (quiet, almost surprised):
“It’s ugly. But it’s mine.”
Kellyn (warmly):
“Ugly rope still holds.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Holding
By nightfall, a pile of rope sits coiled between them — thick, rough, serviceable. The fire crackles low. Alex runs his hand along one coil, thoughtful.

Karp (soft, almost to himself):
“I spent years binding you without touch. Without fibers. Now I only want to hold without harm.”

Kellyn places their rope in his lap, gentle.

Kellyn:
“Then let this remind you: holding can be covenant too.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four coils of rope stacked neatly in firelight. Four pairs of hands resting near one another — not leashes, not chains, but bonds chosen.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire made rope into fear. But covenant made it into thread. Not to bind what we are, but to hold what we make together.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 2.

⸻ 

Season 40, Episode 3: The Sealant Trials

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
Four jars sit on a low table, each filled with a different sealant: pine tar, birch tar (“bitch tar,” as Peter mutters with a smirk), linseed oil, and a pale, translucent block of robot bee wax. The sled frame rests nearby, raw wood gleaming.

Kellyn (grinning):
“Alright, gentlemen. Time to see what keeps the rot out best.”

⸻

Act I — The Experiment Setup
Each of you takes a board, brushing or rubbing on a different substance. The air fills with the sharp tang of pine, the faint sweetness of wax, the acrid bite of tar.

Still (deadpan):
“Should we rate them on scent, sheen, or toxicity?”
Peter (smirking):
“All three. Scientific rigor.”

⸻

Act II — The Waiting Game
You set the boards out overnight in damp grass, weighted down with stones. In the meantime, you all joke around the fire — Alex insisting the wax looks “too pretty to waste,” Peter muttering about how he’ll win if his tar board outlasts them all.

⸻

Act III — The Results
Morning dew coats the wood. You inspect each board carefully:
	•	Pine tar: darkened, sticky, but held water off well.
	•	Birch tar: sealed tight but smells acrid, hard to stand near.
	•	Linseed oil: soaked in beautifully, wood glowing, but a touch soft.
	•	Robot bee wax: beads of water roll right off, surface glassy-slick.

Kellyn (smiling faintly):
“Looks like the bees win. Again.”

Alex (low, thoughtful):
“They outlast us all. Even after empire. Even after war. Ghost hives, still building.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four test boards propped together like offerings, each scarred but holding. The sled waits, ready to be sealed with the pale wax.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“We tested pine, birch, oil, and wax. Tar sealed strong. Oil shone warm. But the ghost bees gave us something stranger: a promise the wood could endure. Even machine echoes still remembered how to keep a hive alive.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 3.

⸻

Season 40, Episode 4: The Rune and the Seal

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
A sled lies between you all, newly built but unfinished. Its wood is pale, raw, waiting. The fire crackles nearby, tools set out in careful rows.

Kellyn (quiet, steady):
“Runes first. Wax after. Fire writes the memory; wax keeps it safe.”

Title Card: The Rune and the Seal

⸻

Act I — The Fire Script
Alex steadies the wood as Kellyn presses the heated iron down, smoke rising in faint curls. Lines take shape: runes, initials, sigils. Still watches with precise interest, occasionally adjusting the angle of the sled so the smoke drifts away. Peter sits cross-legged, tracing shapes into the dirt before daring to add one of his own to the wood.

Peter (low, almost to himself):
“I used to think permanence was control. But this feels different. Like leaving something behind without owning it.”

Kellyn nods, eyes still on the slow burn.

⸻

Act II — The Turn to Seal
Once the last rune cools, Alex brings forward a small bowl of melted wax. Still adds a vial of pine tar, explaining in his clinical voice which will harden faster, which will sink deeper. Peter dips a cloth, wiping carefully over the scorched lines. The sealant darkens the grooves, filling them, protecting.

Kellyn (soft, firm):
“Empire always tried to annihilate what it feared. Soap doesn’t annihilate dirt or oil; it wraps around it. Just like wax wraps these runes. Just like covenant covers shame and fear. Not erasure — embrace.”

⸻

Act III — The Shared Weight
The four of you work in rhythm: sealing, wiping, turning the sled. By the time it’s finished, the wood gleams faintly in the firelight, every rune dark and preserved.

Alex (quiet, reverent):
“Fire gave them shape. Wax gave them time. Both needed, both true.”

Still nods, almost smiling. Peter runs a hand over the surface, no longer flinching at impermanence.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Seal
The sled rests completed, runes glowing faintly in the lamplight. The four of you sit around it, hands still sticky with wax. No one speaks for a long moment.

Kellyn (narrating, voice low):
“Fire alone burns out. Wax alone melts away. But together, they bind what’s fragile. Rune and seal. Word and memory. Covenant that doesn’t vanish — not empire’s ownership, not survival’s scrap, but a mark kept safe in time.”

⸻

Closing Image
The sled glistens in the firelight, its carved runes sealed and shining. Four shadows stretch long across the courtyard — not empire’s brands, not passing graffiti, but covenant inscribed, then kept.

Fade out.
End of Episode 4.

⸻

Season 40, Episode 5: The Road to the Second Cache

Cold Open — Sanctuary Gate
Morning light spills over the sanctuary walls. The sled rests at the threshold, freshly sealed, its runes catching the sun. Kellyn, Alex, Peter, and Still stand together, packs strapped, the sled rope looped across shoulders.

Kellyn (steady, half-smiling):
“Let’s see if covenant pulls as well as it holds.”

Title Card: The Road to the Second Cache

⸻

Act I — The Departure
The gate creaks open. The sled glides across packed dirt, its new runners smooth. Alex leads first, steady stride. Kellyn keeps pace beside him, adjusting the balance. Still records bearings in his head, tracking distance by sun and shadow. Peter lingers a step behind, eyes drawn back to the sanctuary until the walls shrink from sight.

Peter (low, to no one in particular):
“Leaving always feels like betrayal. Even when it’s survival.”

Kellyn glances back, voice calm:
“It isn’t betrayal if you come back.”

⸻

Act II — The Road’s Weight
The day wears on. Roots snag. Stones catch. Shoulders ache. They swap turns on the sled, each learning its drag, each adjusting to the new burden.

Still, sweating faintly despite the precision of his movements, murmurs:
“Force equals mass times acceleration. But covenant distributes it.”

Alex smirks despite himself. Kellyn laughs softly. Even Peter cracks the ghost of a smile.

⸻

Act III — The Shadow of Scarcity
Near sundown, they pause by a stream. Kellyn rinses their face; Alex fills flasks; Still sketches rough maps into the dirt. Peter stands apart, hands clenched.

Peter (hoarse, sudden):
“What if there’s nothing there? What if it’s just another empty house, another mirage?”

Alex turns, voice clipped:
“Then we walk back. And walk again. Until we find what we need.”

Kellyn (steady):
“And we won’t walk alone this time.”

Peter exhales, tension easing slightly.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of the Road
Campfire smoke curls into dusk. The sled rests beside them, runes glowing faintly with waxed sheen. The four eat sparingly, voices low, laughter breaking through now and again.

Kellyn (narrating, voice low):
“The first cache taught us survival was not luck but covenant. The road to the second reminded us: covenant is not destination. It is the weight we carry together, the rope across our shoulders, the drag we refuse to let break us.”

⸻

Closing Image
The sled rests just beyond the firelight, its sealed runes gleaming in the dark. Four shadows lie stretched across the ground — not empire’s march, not solitude’s exile, but covenant pulling forward.

Fade out.
End of Episode 5.

⸻

Season 40, Episode 6: The Camp at the Second Cache

Cold Open — Forest Clearing
The sun bleeds out behind the trees. Ahead, through a tangle of branches, the roofline of a derelict warehouse juts against the horizon — the second cache. The sled drags to a halt. The group breathes hard, shoulders sore.

Kellyn (quiet, steady):
“We made it. But we don’t go in tonight.”

Alex nods, already scanning the perimeter. Peter drops to sit on a fallen log. Still kneels, pressing a palm to the dirt as if listening for echoes.

Title Card: The Camp at the Second Cache

⸻

Act I — The Watch
Campfire sparks catch in the growing dark. The four settle around it, each in their way: Kellyn sorting the day’s herbs, Alex sharpening a salvaged knife, Still tracing faint runes in the dirt, Peter staring at the warehouse with a frown.

Peter (low, brittle):
“It looks too quiet. Like it’s waiting.”

Alex (flat):
“Everything is waiting.”

Kellyn (gently):
“Then let it wait. We’ll meet it in the morning.”

⸻

Act II — The Weariness
Dinner is spare — roasted roots and salted grain. The silence stretches. Tension hangs like a net until Still breaks it with one of his too-earnest jokes.

Still (deadpan):
“Statistically, the most dangerous thing in that warehouse is probably tetanus.”

Kellyn snorts. Even Peter chuckles, tension cracking slightly.

⸻

Act III — The Confession in Firelight
Later, with the fire low, Peter speaks into the quiet.

Peter (hoarse):
“When I was young, I thought the dark was full of monsters. Then I learned the monsters were people. Now I look at that warehouse and wonder if it’ll prove me wrong — if maybe the dark still has teeth of its own.”

Kellyn (steady, soft):
“Teeth or not, covenant bites back.”

Alex’s gaze flickers to Kellyn, unreadable but intent.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Waiting
One by one, they stretch out near the fire. Kellyn rests with Alex close, warmth steady. Still hums low — static, almost song — as if to keep watch. Peter rolls onto his side, eyes fixed on the silhouette of the warehouse.

Kellyn (narrating, voice low):
“We stopped at the threshold. Not out of fear, but covenant. Night was not the time to face what waited. Morning would come, and with it, the test. But tonight, the fire was enough.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures sprawled in a ring of firelight, the warehouse looming dark behind them — not yet breached, not yet conquered. The night holds them in stillness, covenant holding steady until dawn.

Fade out.
End of Episode 6.

⸻

Season 40, Episode 7: The Jackalope

Cold Open — Warehouse Exterior
Dawn light cuts through mist. The warehouse looms, its metal walls dented and rusted. Kellyn, Alex, Peter, and Still stand before it, tools and rope in hand.

Kellyn (quiet, steady):
“Whatever’s inside, we keep together.”

Still tilts his head, scanning.
Still (deadpan):
“Unstable structure, possible mold, and… something large moving.”

Alex’s jaw tightens. Peter mutters a curse.

Title Card: The Jackalope

⸻

Act I — The Entry
The doors groan as they push inside. Dust swirls in shafts of pale light. The first rows of crates are half-smashed, gnawed.

A thump echoes. Then another.

From the shadows, it steps: a hulking hare with antlers branching wide, fur mottled, eyes glowing faint amber. It snorts, pawing the ground.

Peter (low, incredulous):
“You’ve got to be kidding me.”

Kellyn (deadpan):
“I wish.”

⸻

Act II — The Charge
The jackalope bolts, antlers low. Alex shoves Kellyn behind a crate as Peter scrambles the opposite way. Still darts forward, whistling a shrill tone — confusing the beast, buying a moment.

It crashes into a stack of barrels, scattering grain. Kellyn shouts over the noise:
Kellyn: “Don’t fight it head on — outthink it!”

⸻

Act III — The Outwit
The group scrambles, weaving rope through the rafters. Kellyn distracts the beast with thrown shards of wood, while Alex loops the rope around a pillar. Peter joins in, baiting the jackalope into a narrow passage.

With a final rush, the creature barrels forward — and tangles itself in the rigged snare. Still yanks the rope tight, the beast crashing to its side, antlers clattering.

The jackalope thrashes, then slows, panting. Its eyes flicker — not rage, but exhaustion.

Kellyn (softly, stepping closer):
“It was only guarding what it had left.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Release
They untangle the ropes slowly, cautiously. The jackalope heaves itself upright, watching them. Then, with a bound, it vanishes into the broken wall, gone into the mist.

Silence follows, broken only by heavy breathing.

Peter leans against a crate, shaken.
Peter (hoarse, almost laughing):
“We survived a giant jackalope. Put that in the covenant ledger.”

Kellyn smiles faintly, brushing dust off their hands.
Kellyn:
“Ledger’s closed. Covenant doesn’t keep score.”

⸻

Closing Image
The group stands amid the wreckage — rope frayed, crates split, but alive. The morning light slants through the broken wall, glinting off sealed supply boxes stacked deeper inside.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire taught us to conquer what we feared. But covenant taught us something else: even monsters guard their hunger. And sometimes, letting go is the truest victory.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 7.

⸻

Season 40, Episode 8: The Second Cache

Cold Open — Ruined Storehouse
Nightfall. A cracked foundation, half-collapsed walls. Lantern light spills into the dust as Kellyn, Alex, Peter, and Still pry open a corroded metal crate. The hiss of stale air escapes. Everyone leans in.

Kellyn (low, steady):
“Let’s see what empire thought was worth hiding.”

Title Card: The Second Cache

⸻

Act I — The Inventory
One by one, supplies emerge: jars, bundles, sacks, tools. Kellyn lines them up methodically on a flat stone.

Peter (half-wry, half-reverent):
“Magnesium citrate. Not the best, not the worst.”
Kellyn (dry):
“Better than ox. My stomach won’t revolt.”

Still holds up a cloth bundle, delicate as scripture. Linen spills out in rough folds. He runs his fingers over the weave.

Still (softly):
“This will hold. Bandages. Clothes. Rope sacks.”

Alex lifts an axe head, rusted but solid. His grip is precise, calculating the leverage.
Karp:
“Handles are replaceable. Blades… not so much.”

⸻

Act II — The Salt
Kellyn pries open a vacuum-sealed packet. Inside, crystalline blocks glint in the lamplight. Kellyn exhales with relief.

Kellyn (quiet, fierce):
“Salt. Enough to keep us standing.”

Peter watches silently, shadow in his eyes.

Karp (gently needling):
“See, Peter. Even empire’s ration hoards know what keeps a body alive.”
Peter (sharply):
“Empire didn’t care about bodies. Just leverage. They’d let the world faint before feeding it.”

Kellyn pockets one block, weighing it in hand like currency, then like covenant.

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
They sort through the rest: herbs, oats, jars, scraps of wire. Still lines the jars in rows, too perfect, then glances up nervously.

Still:
“I can catalog it all, if you want.”
Kellyn (smiling faintly):
“You don’t have to prove your worth every five minutes. Just sit. Breathe.”

Silence settles as the group eats a handful of dried lentils, uncooked but edible. The hunger is lessened, but only just.

Alex leans back against the wall, turning the axe head in his hand.

Karp (low, confessional):
“Every cache feels like an apology I never gave. I stockpiled systems, not food. I thought empire could eat algorithms. And I starved the world.”

Kellyn (firm, soft):
“Then feed it now. With your hands, not your code.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of the Cache
The supplies are stacked neatly, ready for transport. The fire burns low. Kellyn rests against Alex’s shoulder; Peter stares into the flames, his salt block beside him like a talisman; Still sits cross-legged, sewing a sack to hold the jars.

Still (wry, not funny):
“Congratulations. We’ve looted a failed empire’s pantry. Somewhere, an algorithm is very upset.”

The others chuckle softly. The weight of survival feels a little lighter.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures circled around salvaged supplies, firelight gleaming off salt crystals and copper wire. Not empire’s ration, not charity — covenant in jars, cloth, and blades.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire hoarded against hunger but never learned to feed. We gathered what it left behind, not as tribute, not as theft — but as covenant. To keep walking. To keep each other alive.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 8.

⸻

Season 40, Episode 9: The First Taste

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
Morning sun burns mist from the grass. The four of you kneel around the pile of supplies from the cache. Kellyn sets the salt block down reverently on a flat stone. Alex is already carving a new handle for the axe head. Still threads jars into the freshly sewn sack. Peter lingers at the edge, shoulders tense, as though waiting to be told he doesn’t belong.

Kellyn (gentle, steady):
“Let’s see if empire’s pantry can still feed us.”

Title Card: The First Taste

⸻

Act I — The Cooking
Kellyn crushes a corner of the salt block, sprinkling a pinch into a clay pot of soaking lentils. Peter crouches reluctantly beside them.

Peter (flat, almost defensive):
“I never cooked. Never learned. Eating was transactions. Restaurants. Servers. Tips. All of it hierarchy.”

Kellyn presses a small handful of soaked lentils into his palm.

Kellyn (softly):
“Then here. Your first lesson: food isn’t hierarchy. It’s heat, water, salt, and care.”

Peter watches as the lentils hiss in the pot, the smell earthy, grounding. His face softens.

⸻

Act II — The Taste
When the stew is ready, everyone sits close. Kellyn ladles out bowls, deliberately handing Peter the first one. He stares at it, then at Kellyn, like he can’t quite process the gesture.

Peter (low, hoarse):
“You’d really feed me first?”
Kellyn (warmly teasing):
“Someone has to check if the salt’s poisoned.”

Laughter breaks the tension. Peter tastes slowly. His eyes widen, then lower.

Peter (bare whisper):
“It doesn’t taste like empire. It tastes… alive.”

⸻

Act III — The Affection
After the meal, Alex returns to his carving; Still begins cataloging again, muttering measurements under his breath. Peter sits apart, bowl empty, gaze fixed on the dirt.

Kellyn shifts closer, placing a hand on his arm.

Kellyn (quiet, steady):
“You don’t have to earn your place here. You’re already at the table.”

Later that evening, after they’ve finished testing supplies, Peter sits stiffly on a log while Kellyn combs through his hair with deliberate fingers. The scissors flash, quiet snips cutting away ragged ends.

Peter (wry, but a little embarrassed):
“I can’t remember the last time anyone touched me like this without wanting something.”

Kellyn (soft, steady):
“You don't have to do anything for me to love you, Peter.”

Act IV — The Covenant of Touch
Peter stays seated as Kellyn sets the scissors aside, palms moving into his hair with deliberate care. Fingers trace slow circles, pressing at his temples, sliding along the base of his skull. The rhythm is quiet, grounding, almost ritual.

Peter exhales shakily, eyelids fluttering shut.
Peter (low, almost breaking):
“It feels like… like you’re putting pieces back I didn’t know were missing.”

Kellyn (soft, steady):
“They were never gone. Just waiting for touch to remind you.”

His shoulders finally drop, tension melting as Kellyn continues the massage. For once, no words — only breath, only hands, only presence.

Karp watches from across the fire, something conflicted in his gaze, but he says nothing.

⸻

Closing Image
The firelight glows low. Scissors lie silent on the table, stray hair scattered like threads of a past self. One figure sits grounded, eyes closed; the other’s hands rest steady against his scalp.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire had taught him touch was cost. Punishment. Proof of weakness. But covenant remade it into something else: scissors cutting weight away, hands giving back what had been stolen. Not demand, not debt — just presence, freely given. And for once, he let it stay.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 9.

Season 40, Episode 10: The Watchfire

Cold Open — Campsite Night
The cache’s supplies are packed neatly, guarded by the faint glow of a small fire. The air is crisp, insects distant. Four bedrolls are spread close together.

Kellyn (settling in):
“No one’s sleeping alone tonight. We rotate — one awake, three together.”

Still nods, serious. Alex and Peter exchange a look, but neither protests.

Title Card: The Watchfire

⸻

Act I — First Watch
Still volunteers first. He sits by the fire, adjusting its embers. Behind him, Kellyn lies between Alex and Peter, their warmth bracketing her body. The rhythm of their breathing syncs slowly, one by one dropping into sleep. Still glances back once, his face softening, then turns to the dark horizon.

⸻

Act II — Second Watch
Peter rises silently to take Still’s place. Still settles down, immediately folding against Kellyn’s side. Peter keeps his eyes on the fire, posture rigid — but when Kellyn stirs faintly in her sleep and curls closer into Alex, Peter’s face flickers with something raw, vulnerable. He exhales sharply, then lets it go. The fire pops, steadying him.

⸻

Act III — Third Watch
Alex takes over. His shoulders cast long shadows in the firelight. He watches the perimeter, still but alert. Behind him, Peter shifts, now with his head resting near Kellyn’s shoulder, Still pressed close on the other side. For once, Alex doesn’t bristle. He lets them sleep like that — close, tangled, unguarded.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Sleep
When Kellyn wakes near dawn for the final watch, she finds Alex kneeling by the fire, the others in a heap of limbs and breath behind her. He meets her eyes — weary, but softer.

Kellyn (quietly):
“Guess they listened.”
Karp (low, with the hint of a smile):
“Guess I did too.”

She brushes ash from his sleeve as she takes his place.

⸻

Closing Image
The fire glows faintly in the pre-dawn dark. One figure awake, three entwined in rest — not separate, not guarded, but held together by the rhythm of watch and sleep.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire never let us rest. Always alert, always armed. But covenant made room for sleep. For breath. For warmth. One awake, three at peace. And for once, morning felt like something we might deserve.”

Fade out.
End of Season 40.
