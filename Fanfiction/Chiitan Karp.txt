The review board didn’t mince words.

“Two weeks. Community service. Consider it… reflective time.”

Karp adjusted his scarf, hair already rebelling against the fluorescent lights. “Two weeks where?”

Behind him, Peter Thiel clapped a hand on his shoulder like a high-school football coach with a dubious plan.
“Don’t sweat it, Alex. I pulled some strings. Easy gig. No paperwork, no court-ordered seminars. Just… mascoting.”

Karp narrowed his eyes. “Mascoting?”

Cut to: the Philadelphia subway.

The morning crowd surged past as Karp, philosopher-executive, reluctant capitalist, now found himself zipped into an oversized Chiitan costume — a giant otter with a turtle backpack. His first assignment: wave cheerfully at commuters while attempting not to collapse under the sheer symbolic irony.

Children squealed. Wall Street interns took selfies. One woman shouted:
“Hey isn’t that the Palantir guy?!”

Inside the suit, sweat dripping, Karp muttered:
“I was not trained for this… Habermas never warned me.”

Still, he waved. And the crowd waved back. For once, Alex Karp wasn’t unreadable or unmodelable. He was simply: Chiitan.

Day One
Karp collapses onto the subway bench, Chiitan head under his arm, hair frizzing like an aura of static. The commuters are gone, the selfies uploaded. He dreads what comes next: the review.

In a dim back room, lit only by a flickering vending machine, sits the original artist behind Chiitan. Pencil tucked behind one ear, clipboard in hand, eyes gleaming with impossible standards.

“Mr. Karp,” they begin, “today’s performance rated Moderate Absurdity. Your turtle-backflip lacked conviction. Your crowd interaction veered toward ‘eccentric uncle,’ not ‘unhinged otter.’ Grade: C+.”

Karp, still half in the suit, tries to counter.
“I improvised with the shopping cart. The crowd laughed.”

The artist shakes their head.
“Laughter isn’t absurdity. Laughter is compliance. You must disturb the normies, not entertain them.”

Karp scribbles notes furiously, muttering about Habermas and semiotic contagion.

Day Seven
By now, Karp is experimenting. He climbs into trash cans, hands out manifestos written on napkins, teaches a group of children how to chant “ontology.”
The artist observes quietly, then makes a single mark on the page:
“B-: promising chaos.”

⸻

Day Fourteen
The final review.
Karp has pushed himself to the edge — juggling traffic cones, staging philosophical debates with pigeons, staging a mock coup against a SEPTA employee.

The artist nods slowly.
“You have finally grasped it. True absurdity is not performed. It is lived. Grade: A.”

Karp exhales, trembling. “So… I’ve passed?”

The artist leans forward, eyes glinting.
“Passed? No. You’ve only begun. The suit is yours now. Don’t take it off.”
