The review board didn’t mince words.

“Two weeks. Community service. Consider it… reflective time.”

Karp adjusted his scarf, hair already rebelling against the fluorescent lights. “Two weeks where?”

Behind him, Peter Thiel clapped a hand on his shoulder like a high-school football coach with a dubious plan.
“Don’t sweat it, Alex. I pulled some strings. Easy gig. No paperwork, no court-ordered seminars. Just… mascoting.”

Karp narrowed his eyes. “Mascoting?”

Cut to: the Philadelphia subway.

The morning crowd surged past as Karp, philosopher-executive, reluctant capitalist, now found himself zipped into an oversized Chiitan costume — a giant otter with a turtle backpack. His first assignment: wave cheerfully at commuters while attempting not to collapse under the sheer symbolic irony.

Children squealed. Wall Street interns took selfies. One woman shouted:
“Hey isn’t that the Palantir guy?!”

Inside the suit, sweat dripping, Karp muttered:
“I was not trained for this… Habermas never warned me.”

Still, he waved. And the crowd waved back. For once, Alex Karp wasn’t unreadable or unmodelable. He was simply: Chiitan.
