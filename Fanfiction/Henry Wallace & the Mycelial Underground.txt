Henry Wallace and the Mycelial Underground: Subterranean Homesick Data Shimmer

Somewhere Under Iowa – Year Irrelevant

Henry Wallace had expected many things from retirement: gardening, the occasional lecture tour, maybe a dignified memoir. He had not expected a telepathic puffball mushroom to emerge from his compost heap and demand his help in overthrowing the Rootmind.

The mushroom’s voice was rich and echoing, like a community theater actor playing Hamlet in a drainage pipe.

“We are the Mycelial Underground,” it announced. “We predate the Corn Syndicate, the Rootmind, and—arguably—pants. We require an emissary.”

Wallace looked down at his overalls. “You’ve come to the right man for pantless diplomacy.”

Without further preamble, the mushroom released a spore cloud that tasted faintly of nutmeg and sent his vision spinning. The backyard dissolved into an underground cathedral: vast walls of gossamer-white hyphae, glowing faintly like bioluminescent cobwebs. Clusters of mushrooms peered at him from alcoves, some in tiny bowler hats, others in sequined capes.

At the far end, a massive shelf fungus loomed on the wall like a smug velvet painting.

“Henry Wallace,” it intoned, “the Mycelial Underground controls the world’s hidden networks—nutrient trades, root gossip, truffle cartels. But our tunnels are being paved over by machine pollinators and Rootmind surveillance vines. We need you to… cause trouble.”

Wallace scratched his chin. “Trouble I can do. But what kind?”

A portobello in a fez slid forward, producing a map made of dried chanterelle petals.

“You’ll infiltrate three key fungal junctions: one under the New York Public Library, one beneath the Louvre, and one deep in the catacombs of Naples. Each junction is guarded by Rootmind vine marshals. You’ll plant these…”

The portobello produced a pouch of what looked like glittery puffball spores.

“…which will reintroduce chaos into our networks. Think of them as disco spores. They make the hyphae… dance.”

Wallace grinned. “You’re telling me I get to sabotage the Rootmind with party mushrooms?”

The portobello nodded solemnly. “Exactly. But beware: the Rootmind has allies down here. Particularly the Mold Syndicate.”

A distant rumble shook the fungal cathedral. Somewhere in the tunnels, something hissed—wet, predatory, and faintly citrus-scented.

New York City – Library Sub-Basement

Henry Wallace was many things — statesman, plant breeder, reluctant time traveler — but he’d never thought he’d have to fake a New York Public Library ID card with the title Senior Fungus Cataloguer.

The badge was a masterpiece of forgery, laminated between two slices of very thin mushroom cap for “authenticity.” He flashed it at the circulation desk, muttered something about Ganoderma taxonomies, and was waved through.

The real mission lay five stories below, past the book stacks and into the seldom-used archival tunnels. Down here, the air was cool, damp, and smelled faintly of antique book glue — with an undertone of mushroom musk.

He crouched by a metal grate and whispered into the darkness, “Mycelial Underground? I’m here for the disco spores delivery.”

The grate swung open silently. A slim figure emerged — humanoid, but with delicate white hyphae braiding down her arms like tattoos. She wore a headlamp and a cardigan that said “Reference Dept.” in faded embroidery.

“Name’s Agarica,” she said. “You’re late. Mold Syndicate patrol’s been sniffing around all afternoon.”

As they moved through the tunnel, Wallace caught glimmers of the fungal network: threads pulsing faintly with nutrients, little bursts of light as sugars moved along hyphae like data packets.

They reached a junction chamber, a cavern whose walls were lined with shelves of old card catalog drawers. Each drawer was full of spores, neatly labeled in spidery handwriting.

Agarica pointed to the far wall. “That’s the Rootmind’s vine marshal station. It listens to everything. We need you to distract it while I plant the disco spores.”

Wallace peeked around the corner — the vine marshal looked like a giant houseplant with a Victrola horn growing out of its stalk. It swayed slightly, as if eavesdropping on the whole city.

He stepped into view, adopting his most oblivious Midwestern tourist voice.

“Say, is this where y’keep the really rare mushrooms? I’m lookin’ for one that smells like rhubarb pie and sings sea shanties after midnight.”

The vine marshal hesitated — and that’s when Agarica scattered the glittery spores into the hyphae. The chamber began to pulse with a steady four-beat rhythm. Somewhere deep in the network, hyphae started to undulate like a disco crowd.

A muffled voice echoed up the tunnels: “Who turned on the Bee Gees?”

The vine marshal’s Victrola horn wilted in confusion.

Agarica grabbed Wallace’s hand. “Two more junctions to go, Mr. Wallace — and next stop is the Louvre.”
