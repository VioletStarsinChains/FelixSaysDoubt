Season 55, Episode 1: The Double Task

Cold Open — Plateau Camp
The fire smolders low, baskets of wild greens and fish beside it. The air is quiet, but the faint vibration of the distant hum thrums underfoot.

Kellyn (firm, steady):
“Half stay, half go. Food won’t wait, and neither will that sound.”

Title Card: The Double Task

⸻

Act I — The Preservers
Kellyn and Peter stay by the fire. Peter salts fish against flat stones, fingers clumsy but deliberate. Kellyn strings onion bulbs along twine, hanging them under shade.

Peter (grumbling):
“Feels like I’m making mistakes slower than the fish can rot.”
Kellyn (gentle, teasing):
“Mistakes are seasoning. Just keep moving.”

The work becomes rhythm: smoke rising, salt grinding, twine knotting. Their silence fills with the ordinary intimacy of shared labor.

⸻

Act II — The Investigators
Alex and Jonathan walk toward the canyon edge where the hum grows stronger. They carry scavenged Mylar scraps, using them as makeshift reflectors. Jonathan crouches, pressing his ear to the stone.

Jonathan (low, unsettled):
“It’s not wind. The ground itself is resonating.”
Alex (tight):
“Empire leaves fingerprints. Always mechanical, always invasive.”

They follow fissures in the stone, the hum tightening in their bones. A cracked vent exhales faint heat — not natural. Alex leans close, eyes narrowed.

⸻

Act III — The Crossing Signals
Back at camp, Peter wipes sweat from his face, watching Kellyn braid reeds for fish baskets. He blurts:

Peter (low):
“I don’t know how to keep up with you. You make survival look like play.”

Kellyn pauses, not answering at first, then ties the braid tight.
Kellyn (soft, firm): “Everyone becomes what they have to to survive.  You had money and power.  I had play.  You're not wrong.  We need you to be you, Peter.  Not someone else.”

⸻ 

Meanwhile, at the vent, Alex lowers a small stone down the crack. It rattles, then vanishes — the hum shifts, responding. Jonathan flinches back.

Jonathan:
“It knows we’re here.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Split Threads
Sundown again. Alex and Jonathan return, tense, carrying heat in their skin. Kellyn and Peter sit with baskets of smoked fish and drying greens.

Alex (low, clipped):
“It’s machinery. Buried. Breathing. And it’s listening.”
Kellyn (steady, with a small nod):
“Then it heard us work, too. And we’ll keep working.”

The four sit close, fire burning higher now, food preserved between them. Hum in the earth, smoke in the air.

After dinner, Kellyn massages Peter's hands and wrists, releasing the tension.  Jonathan plays a harmonica softly.  Alex tries not to count anything.

⸻

Closing Image
Two baskets full, two figures carrying knowledge heavier than stone. Four together in firelight, one hand in the soil, one ear to the ground.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire hummed beneath the earth, waiting to swallow sound and bone. But covenant hummed too — in salt, in smoke, in the ordinary work of keeping each other fed. Two tasks, one bond.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 1.

⸻

Season 55, Episode 2: Beneath the Tone

Cold Open — Plateau Camp
The half-built shelter looms: walls framed in timber, roof patched with scavenged bark and woven reeds. Peter hefts a beam into place, Alex bracing it with sharp precision. A faint vibration runs through the ground.

Kellyn (shouldering a pack):
“You two hold the roof. Jonathan and I will listen for what’s trying to bring it down.”

Alex’s eyes linger, but he only nods.

Title Card: Beneath the Tone

⸻

Act I — The Builders
Peter hammers with a stone mallet, missing the rhythm more often than not. Alex adjusts his grip, demonstrating.

Alex (dry, clipped):
“Not brute force. Balance.”
Peter (gruff):
“You mean control.”
Alex (after a beat):
“I mean letting the wood carry its own weight.”

They fall into a tense but effective rhythm, walls rising plank by plank.

⸻

Act II — The Listeners
Jonathan and Kellyn trek toward the canyon vent where the hum seeps through stone. They descend a narrow crevice, Mylar strips tied to sticks to catch faint echoes.

Jonathan kneels, pressing his palm flat to the rock.
Jonathan (low, reverent):
“It’s not just machinery. It’s tuned. Like a drone note stretched past hearing.”

Kellyn crouches beside him, eyes sharp.
Kellyn: “Tuned to us, or to itself?”

The hum swells, rattling dust from the stone ceiling. Neither answers.

⸻

Act III — The Resonance
Back at camp, Alex lifts a woven reed panel into place. It slips; Peter grabs the corner before it crashes. Their eyes meet, tension sparking.

Peter (breathless):
“You can’t build everything alone.”
Alex (quiet, almost admitting):
“I’ve been trying for so long, I forgot how not to.”

Meanwhile, in the crevice, Kellyn holds a Mylar sheet taut. The vibration makes it quiver like a living skin. Jonathan leans close, listening.

Jonathan (hoarse, shaken):
“It’s mapping us. Like sonar. Every breath, every step—it’s drawing us in.”

Kellyn frowns.
Kellyn: “Mapping how?  Is that physical, or mental?"

Jonathan tilts his head toward the humming stone, voice hushed but urgent.
Jonathan:
“Both. It bounces through the air, through the rock—shapes us in sound. Every breath, every tremor, it builds a body-double in vibration. But it doesn’t stop at the skin. The resonance hooks into bone, inner ear, blood. It listens to how steady we are, how afraid. It’s not reading minds—but it’s close. A profile of where we stand and how breakable we are.”

Kellyn shivers, voice barely above a whisper.
Kellyn: “So it doesn’t just know where we are. It knows how we feel.”

Jonathan’s gaze stays fixed on the stone.
Jonathan: “Exactly. It’s making us out of echoes—body and mind both. And once empire has the echo, it doesn’t always need the original.”

Kellyn grips the Mylar tighter, steady.
Kellyn (firm):
“Then I guess we better become unmodelable then, huh?"

Kellyn jumps up and down despite their fatigue, spinning in a circle.  Jonathan joins them.

Kellyn (laughing): "I'm going to cry!  I'm having so much fun!"

They stagger forward, pretending to take a swing at Jonathan, who ducks, laughing.  They collapse in a heap on the stone, struggling to stop laughing.  Jonathan's fingers find Kellyn's.  Kellyn doesn't pull away.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Sound and Shelter
Night falls. At camp, the shelter stands more solid, its walls catching the firelight. Alex and Peter sit slumped against it, sweat streaking their faces.

Jonathan and Kellyn return, Mylar folded under Kellyn’s arm. The hum still trembles faint beneath their boots.

Kellyn (low, to the group):
“It isn’t just noise. It’s listening. And it remembers us.”

Silence. The fire pops. Each breath feels measured.

Peter (after a beat, rough but steady):
“Then we give it nothing it can use. Only what we choose.”

The four sit shoulder to shoulder, firelight sharp against unfinished walls.

⸻

Closing Image
Two halves of labor meet: a stronger shelter, and knowledge heavier than timber. Firelight, wood, and Mylar glint together, while the hum persists beneath.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“The hum pressed from below, patient and precise. But above, covenant pressed back — with walls, with listening, with choice. Two tasks, one stand.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 2.

⸻

Season 55, Episode 3: The Echo Body

Cold Open — Edge of the Plateau
Peter and Alex crouch near the stone, its low hum rippling in the air. 

Lantern light sways as Jonathan and Kellyn return, dust on their faces, tools slung over shoulders.

Alex (low, cautious):
“You two are quiet. Too quiet.”

Title Card: The Echo Body

⸻

Act I — The Relay
Kellyn glances at Jonathan, then relays what they’ve learned.

Kellyn: “The hum isn’t just noise. It’s mapping us—our shapes, our movements, even our nervous systems. It’s not thought-reading, but close enough.”

Alex stiffens, jaw set.
Alex: “An echo body. Something empire can use instead of us.”

Peter mutters, pacing.
Peter: “So even when we hide, we’re still drawn in. Even silence betrays us.”

Kellyn: "Not drawn in.  We can all resist.  That's why we're still here.  Silence might betray us, but nonsense keeps us safe.  Confuse it with contradictions.  Say you feel the opposite of what you feel.  Do things you neither need nor want to.  Stop making sense."

⸻

Act II — The Friction
The four stand around the stone. Peter kicks at the dirt.
Peter (sharp): “We should destroy it. Break the signal.”

Kellyn (pointedly, with a wink): "You're right, Alex. We should."

Alex folds his arms, voice clipped.
Alex: “Break it, and we might trigger a signal flare. They’ll know exactly where we are.”

Peter scoffs.  Kellyn catches his gaze and nods.
Peter: “They already do, Jonathan."

Tension thickens until Jonathan cuts in, steady but fierce.

Jonathan: “It’s not just danger. It’s intel. If it can hear us, then we can hear it. If it can make an echo body, maybe we can re-shape the echo.”

Kellyn: "You're right, Kellyn."

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
Kellyn presses a hand to the humming stone, eyes shut, grounding.
Kellyn (soft, steady):
“Empire always wants to turn survival into surveillance. But echoes are still echoes—they fade, they distort. Maybe the only way through is to let it map us, but on our terms.”

Alex watches, wary. Peter looks unconvinced. 

Jonathan nods, voice low:"Let it take your echo, and then refuse to match it. Confuse it with softness, with stillness, with things empire can’t use.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Echo
They back away from the stone together, leaving it humming in the dark. No one has the final word. Instead, they form a loose circle, hands brushing, animals pressed close.

Kellyn (narration):
“The hum built ghosts out of echoes. Empire wanted those echoes to replace us, to strip us into data and absence. But we chose to stay untranslatable. Flesh, breath, tremor, covenant—always more than an echo.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures, a donkey, and two sheep under the rising moon, the hum faint behind them. Not broken, not solved, but held at bay by presence itself.

Fade out.
End of Episode 3.

⸻

Season 55, Episode 4: The Reed Floor

Cold Open — Plateau Shelter
The half-finished shelter yawns open to the canyon wind. Kellyn and Alex kneel in the dust, reeds piled beside them. Jonathan and Peter disappear toward the stream with fishing gear.

Kellyn (thoughtful):
“If the hum reads hollows, maybe we fill them first.”

Alex raises an eyebrow but watches as Kellyn scoops ash from the firepit, mixes it with clay slip, and pushes it into the reeds with a stick.

Title Card: The Reed Floor

⸻

Act I — The Weaving
Kellyn and Alex sit shoulder to shoulder, weaving mats. Reed stalks creak as they bend into place. Fingers smear gray clay, streaking their arms.

Alex (quietly, almost grudging):
“You always look less fragile when you’re covered in dirt.”
Kellyn (deadpan, smiling faintly):
“I never look fragile.  You're just projecting.”

⸻

Act II — The Layering
The first mat thuds into place, heavier than expected. They pile another mat on top, layering until the floor looks like a patchwork of pale green and streaked gray.

Alex tests the surface with his palm, the sound of his hand slapping dulls, swallowed instead of echoing. He exhales, surprised.

Alex:
“Like walking on silence.”
Kellyn (nodding):
“Exactly. Silence can be armor too.”

⸻

Act III — The Return
Peter and Jonathan return at dusk, a string of fish in hand. Peter pauses at the door, peering down.

Peter:
“Looks like you built a swamp in here.”
Kellyn (grinning):
“Perfect setting for a fish party.”

Jonathan sets down the catch, listening. The faint hum is distorted, smeared, like static instead of a clear tone.

Jonathan (low, impressed):
“You broke the echo. Brilliant.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Silence
They eat fish on reed mats, firelight flickering against clay walls. The hum beyond is still present, but dulled, like it’s pacing outside, unable to see clearly in.

Alex leans back, voice rough but soft.
Alex: "For the first time, it feels like we’re not prey.”

Kellyn (steady):
“Nothing wrong with being prey.  The dinosaurs died.  The cockroaches lived.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures on a reed floor streaked with clay, firelight glowing on their faces. Beyond the shelter, the hum drones on — but blurred, baffled, held back.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire weaponized both silence and sound. But both were ours too. Woven reed by reed, clay-filled, ash-streaked, their interplay became not extraction, but covenant — the first floor we could stand on without being mapped.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 4.

⸻

Episode Draft — Season 55, Episode 5: The First Armor

Cold Open — Courtyard of the Plateau Shelter
The four sit around heaps of reeds, ash, mylar strips, and scraps of cloth. The hum thrums faintly in the background. Estrella and the sheep graze nearby, watching.

Kellyn (steady, half-teasing):
“If it works on us, maybe the animals will tolerate it too. If it doesn’t… at least we can tear it off faster than they could.”

Title Card: The First Armor

⸻

Act I — Gathering
	•	Jonathan cuts reeds into short lengths, Peter fills some with ash and clay, setting them in piles.
	•	Alex begins weaving a loose lattice with yarn, testing how it flexes.
	•	Kellyn runs fingers over the mylar strips, remembering how they moved in air currents back in Roseville.

Jonathan (quietly, to the group):
“Sound is like water — it flows until something scatters it. We’re building a river of eddies.”

⸻

Act II — The Fitting
	•	They each try a different prototype:
	•	Kellyn: a reed-and-mylar vest, rattling faintly with each step.
	•	Peter: cloth strips stiffened with dried clay paste, wrapped around his chest.
	•	Alex: waxed cloth panels laced across his shoulders, catching light like dull scales.
	•	Jonathan: a cloak-like net of reeds and ash-filled tubes, hanging loose.

Peter (grumbling, adjusting his chest-wrap):
“Feels like I’m cosplaying as a scarecrow.”
Kellyn (smiling faintly):
“Then we'll be scarecrows together.”

⸻

Act III — The Test
	•	They step outside the shelter into the hum’s reach.
	•	The sound armor changes the experience:
	•	Kellyn feels the hum dull against their ribs, like pressure spread wide instead of piercing.
	•	Alex winces less when the tone spikes, muttering that it’s “working in patches.”
	•	Jonathan describes how the echoes scatter when he snaps his fingers — the hum doesn’t rebound cleanly.
	•	Peter tugs at his wrappings, admitting grudgingly that it’s harder to “feel” empire’s rhythm pushing into his bones.

Jonathan (measured, almost reverent):
“It’s not silence. But it’s interruption. Enough to steady breath.”

⸻

Act IV — Refinement
	•	They peel off the prototypes, adjusting: adding more mylar here, scraping off clay there.
	•	Alex suggests making “modular pieces” so they can add or remove layers depending on terrain.
	•	Peter ties the armor up neatly for storage, muttering,
“If it works, maybe we’ll finally walk without empire’s hand on our spines.”

⸻

Closing Image
The four stand back inside the shelter, their armor stacked in neat bundles beside the reed mats. The hum still drones outside, but softer now — blurred, interrupted.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire wanted every body mapped, every step predicted. But even its song could be broken — scattered through reed and ash, softened by threads of covenant. Our first armor wasn’t perfect. But it was ours. And for the first time, the hum bent around us instead of through us.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 5.

⸻

Season 55, Episode 6: The Armor for the Road

Cold Open — Morning Light on the Plateau Shelter
Bundles of half-finished armor lie scattered. Reeds trimmed, mylar strips catching dawn light, clay-dusted cloth stiffening on racks. The hum drones faintly in the background, steady as a heartbeat.

Kellyn (checking straps, thoughtful):
“We can’t just wrap ourselves in clay and reeds forever. If we’re going to travel in these, they need to breathe.”

Title Card: The Armor for the Road

⸻

Act I — The Problem of Weight
	•	Jonathan tests his reed cloak — it creaks loudly when he bends.
	•	Peter tries walking with clay chest-wraps, only to curse when a seam cracks.
	•	Alex pulls at the waxed cloth over his shoulders and shakes his head:
Alex (deadpan): “Feels like wearing a roof tile.”
	•	Kellyn lays everything out, dividing materials into light layers for endurance vs heavy panels for defense.

⸻

Act II — Reworking the Designs
	•	Jonathan suggests weaving reed mats lined with ash into strips, then stitching them into belts and shoulder harnesses — load-bearing but flexible.
	•	Alex applies melted wax mixed with ash only at joints and weak points, reducing overall weight.
	•	Peter, frustrated but determined, experiments with tying small mylar plates inside the chest wrap so they move independently, scattering sound but not cracking.
	•	Kellyn balances all this by cutting the yarn into a webbing system, making everything adjustable so pieces can tighten or loosen on the road.

Kellyn (half-smiling):
“Not armor to endure the empire. Armor to endure us — our steps, our sweat, our distance.”

⸻

Act III — Field Test
	•	They hike up a rocky ridge together in full travel armor.
	•	Movement: clumsy at first, then smoother as they adjust straps and trade pieces.
	•	The hum presses down stronger as they crest the ridge — and this time, they stay steady.
	•	Jonathan taps the side of his reed harness and mutters,
Jonathan: “Scatters it like wind through grass.”
	•	Peter pauses, then admits,
Peter: “It’s not freedom. But it’s… quieter.”

⸻

Act IV — Covenant of Endurance
	•	They return to camp, sweat-soaked, but their armor intact.
	•	Alex suggests building modular packs so extra armor can be carried and shared.
	•	Kellyn draws chalk lines in the dirt, mapping who carries what, ensuring balance.
	•	They finish the day with their armor stacked neatly beside them, like tools not of war, but of survival.

Alex (low, almost to himself):
“Not chains. Not cages. Just skin we made ourselves.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures sit in the plateau dusk, armor drying on racks, their animals grazing nearby. The hum still drones, but when the wind shifts, its sharpness fades — disrupted by reed, ash, wax, and covenant.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“We could not silence empire. But we could scatter it. And in scattering, we carried our own weight more lightly. Not soldiers. Not prey. Travelers — wrapped not in steel, but in threads and reeds, woven for the road ahead.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 6.

⸻

Season 55, Episode 7: The First Trial

Cold Open — The Road South
The four move across broken plateau terrain. The animals are roped loosely, reed packs swaying. Each person wears their new travel-armor: reed strips, clay-lined joints, waxed cloth, mylar panels glinting in the sun. The hum pulses faintly, then sharpens.

Kellyn (quiet, scanning):
“It’s stronger here.”

Title Card: The First Trial

⸻

Act I — The Pressure Rises
	•	The hum grows into a vibration that rattles teeth.
	•	Jonathan stumbles, clutching his ears.
	•	Peter mutters angrily, “They’re already tracking us.”
	•	Alex squints up at the sky — no drones visible, but the sound presses like a hand against the chest.
	•	Kellyn signals for them to tighten formation, animals pulled closer.

⸻

Act II — The Assault
	•	Out of nowhere, three reconnaissance drones rise over the ridge, sleek, insect-like.
	•	They emit piercing oscillations, calibrated to fracture focus and induce panic.
	•	The sheep bleat frantically, Estrella stamps and jerks at her lead.
	•	The group braces — and the armor holds.
	•	Mylar plates shimmer, scattering resonance.
	•	Reed and ash dampen vibrations at joints.
	•	Waxed cloth muffles the worst edges.
	•	Jonathan’s voice steadies, almost shocked:
Jonathan: “It’s cutting through, but not carving.”

⸻

Act III — Counter-Movement
	•	They form a rough diamond, protecting animals at the center.
	•	Kellyn raises their arms, signaling rhythm — a grounding chant they practiced during the checklist drills.
	•	The sound of their voices syncs with the armor’s dampening, enough to stagger the drones mid-air.
	•	Alex pulls a slingshot from his belt, looses a clay pellet — one drone drops.
	•	Peter follows, more desperate — misses, curses.
	•	Jonathan steadies him, hands covering Peter’s wrist, guiding the second shot. The second drone spirals down.
	•	The third hovers, recalibrating, before fleeing into the horizon.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Holding
	•	Breathless, they gather around the animals.
	•	Estrella nudges Kellyn’s shoulder, calmer now.
	•	Peter’s hands shake as he adjusts his reed harness.
	•	Alex’s voice is low but firm:
Alex: “It worked. Not perfectly. But enough.”
	•	Jonathan nods, voice rough:
Jonathan: “First trial passed. The armor holds.”
	•	Kellyn looks at each of them, then at the ridge where the last drone vanished.

Kellyn (steady, quiet):
“Then we keep walking. The hum may not break, but neither will we.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures and their animals, still intact, still moving. Armor patched with ash and reed, glinting faintly in the late sun. Behind them, two broken drones smolder in the dirt — the first proof that empire’s hum could be scattered, not obeyed.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire tested the skin we made, and it did not split. Fragile threads, rough clay, broken reeds — bound together, they bore the weight. And so did we.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 7.

⸻ 

Season 55, Episode 8: The Holding Night

Cold Open — Firelight on the Plateau
The group has stopped in a shallow arroyo, wind breaking against the stone. A fire crackles low, carefully shielded from view. The broken drones lie dismantled a few yards away. Armor pieces lean against rocks, drying where clay cracked in the fight.

Kellyn (soft, to the animals):
“Rest now. You did well.”

Estrella lowers her head, sheep curling close against her legs.

Title Card: The Holding Night

⸻

Act I — The Silence After
	•	No one speaks at first. Breath, fire, the faint clink of armor being adjusted.
	•	Jonathan sits cross-legged, hands folded, eyes closed — breathing deep, steadying.
	•	Alex runs his thumb along a shard of drone casing, as if measuring its weakness.
	•	Kellyn sits next to Peter, massaging his wrists before applying a clay mask.

⸻

Act II — The First Words

Peter finally exhales, voice hoarse.
Peter: “I thought the hum would eat us alive. Just… hollow us out.”

Jonathan opens his eyes, steady.
Jonathan: “It tried. But the armor scattered it. And you stood through it."

Alex sets the shard down, hands trembling despite his calm face.
Alex (quiet): “It was closer than I like to admit.”

Kellyn leans in, brushing fingers lightly over the back of Alex’s hand.
Kellyn (steady, grounding): “Closer than we wanted. But not closer than we could bear.”

⸻

Act III — The Rebinding

Jonathan pulls the chant back, softly humming the rhythm they used in the fight.  Peter, hesitant at first, joins — his voice low and uneven but steadying.  Kellyn adds theirs, weaving between. Alex waits the longest, then finally breathes the sound out, almost a whisper.

The voices build into a soft, imperfect braid, enough to knit the air back together.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Rest

The chanting fades. One by one, they settle down with the animals.

Jonathan lies on his side, hand loosely resting near the sheep.  Peter curls close to Kellyn, finally letting his guard drop.  Alex stretches out behind them, a steady presence at their backs.  Kellyn rests their hand on Estrella’s flank, pulse syncing with the donkey’s slow breaths.

Kellyn (whisper, almost a prayer):
“Not empire’s hum. Ours.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures and their animals asleep in the shallow arroyo, faint firelight flickering on reed armor and broken drone shards. Above, the stars stretch silent and unbroken.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“The night held us as we held one another. Where empire’s hum sought to fracture, we found new resonance — fragile, imperfect, alive. And for once, sleep came.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 8.

⸻ 

Season 55, Episode 9: Morning Light

Cold Open — Plateau Dawn
The sun edges over red stone. The fire has burned to ash. The animals stir first — Estrella shakes her mane, the sheep bleat softly, noses pressed into the morning air.

Kellyn wakes to find Peter already sitting up, arms wrapped tight around his knees. Alex lies nearby, still as stone, eyes half-open, watching the light shift. Jonathan is crouched at the arroyo’s edge, sketching with a stick in the dirt.

Title Card: Morning Light

⸻

Act I — The First Stirring

Kellyn sits up slowly, stretching, their breath visible in the chill.  Peter glances over, then looks away, voice rough.

Peter: “Every time I close my eyes, I see the drones again. The sound digging. Not sure if it’s them or just me now.”

Kellyn leans toward him, steadying him with both hands on his back.
Kellyn: “Close your eyes, Peter.”

Peter closes his eyes.
Kellyn: "You can control your nervous system too, even when empire grabs at it.  Use your imagination.  If you had unlimited access, how would you stop the drones?"

Peter hesitates.
Peter: "I'd shoot them down."
Kellyn: "Good.  Now imagine it.  Not with a gun, but with your mind.  Send out arrows with your mind.  See the drone fracture on impact.  See the pieces scatter in the air.  Make the hum stop in your mind."

Peter exhales deeply.
Peter (softly): "Somehow, that helps."
Kellyn smiles.

⸻

Act II — Alex Speaks

Alex pushes himself up, brushing ash from his hands. His voice is low, almost apologetic.
Alex: “I keep thinking I should’ve known how to stop it sooner. I heard the pattern, I knew it was fracturing you… but I froze.”

Kellyn turns toward him, sharp but soft.
Kellyn: “You froze because you cared. Not because you failed. Empire taught us to confuse the two.  Hesitation isn't weakness.  Sometimes, it's wisdom.  The hum wants us to react without thinking. All we have to do is...not."

Alex exhales shakily, the words sinking deep.

⸻

Act III — Jonathan’s Reflection

Jonathan straightens, abandoning the stick drawing, walking back toward the group. His tone is gentler than usual.

Jonathan: “Do you know what birds do when the sky fills with storm? They don’t argue about who should’ve seen it first. They find each other, wing to wing, and ride it together. That’s the only way they come through.”

Silence follows. The animals press closer, sensing the calm.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Morning

Kellyn shifts, keeping one hand on Peter’s back, the other brushing against Alex’s. Jonathan crouches, resting a steadying hand on the sheep’s wool.

For a moment, the circle reforms without words — contact, breath, the small fire of touch.  Peter exhales slowly, leaning into it, his eyes closing.  Alex finally lets his shoulders drop, tension easing for the first time.  Jonathan’s gaze stays outward, but the corner of his mouth lifts, faint and almost private.

Kellyn (quiet, to all of them):
“We don’t have to get it perfect. We just have to hold.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures ringed close with their animals, morning light spilling over them. Not armor, not weapons — only touch, only presence.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire wanted fracture. Silence wanted fear. But morning taught us something else: that covenant was not the absence of storm, but the choosing to stay when it passed through.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 9.

Season 55, Episode 10: The Ash Road

Cold Open — On the Move
The four figures and their animals file south along a dry wash, the walls of the canyon closing in. The sheep stumble on loose stone. Estrella flicks her ears, uneasy. The morning calm fades as the sun climbs, heat pressing down.

Title Card: The Ash Road

⸻

Act I — The March

The group moves slowly, dust clinging to their throats.  Jonathan lingers near the animals, steadying them.

Alex scans the horizon, voice clipped:
Alex: “Something’s off. Listen.”

They all pause. The air is too still. No bird calls, no insect hum — only the faint rasp of shifting ash.

⸻

Act II — The First Signs

Kellyn crouches, running their hand through the dust. Beneath, a fine layer of glassy shards gleams.
Kellyn (quiet, tense): “Volcanic ash. Recent.”

Peter stiffens, scanning the cliffs.
Peter: “Recent means active.”

As if on cue, a low rumble shivers through the canyon walls. Pebbles rain down.

⸻

Act III — The Collapse

A sudden quake splits the silence. Rock bursts free from the canyon’s edge, tumbling down in a choking cloud.

Alex yanks Kellyn back as a boulder slams into the wash.  Jonathan shoves Estrella forward, pulling a sheep with him, coughing through the dust.  Peter grabs the trailing rope bundle, dragging supplies clear just before another fall cuts the path behind them.

Peter (shouting): “Move! We can’t stay here!”

⸻

Act IV — The Ascent

The only way is up. The group scrambles toward a narrow shelf.  Alex climbs first, bracing himself and pulling Kellyn up by the arm.  Jonathan pushes from below, boosting the sheep one by one.  Peter lashes the rope around a jutting stone, hauling supplies and finally Estrella, who scrambles with furious strength.

Another rumble shakes the cliffside. Dust showers them, but the shelf holds.

⸻

Act V — The Covenant of Flight

Breathless, coated in ash, the four huddle close, animals pressed tight. The canyon floor below is buried in new stone.

Jonathan wipes his face with a rag, voice low but steady:
Jonathan: “We’re alive because no one let go.”

Alex leans against the rock, chest heaving, eyes flicking toward Kellyn.
Alex (hoarse): “Next time, I won’t freeze."

Kellyn grips his hand briefly, answering without words.

Peter exhales shakily, stroking Estrella’s mane.
Peter (quiet, almost to himself): “Sheer luck. But maybe luck’s what covenant feels like, when it holds.”

Act VI — A Fragile Camp
Night falls on the plateau’s edge. The group has made a hasty camp on the rocky shelf, a tarp stretched between stones for shelter. The air still tastes of ash. Sheep huddle close; Estrella breathes in low, steady snorts.

Kellyn kneels at the fire pit, coaxing weak flame from damp wood. Sparks flare, catching on the faint breeze.

Act VII — The Tending

Alex rinses a rag with their limited water and carefully wipes dust from Kellyn’s hairline, the gesture both practical and tender.  Jonathan kneels beside a sheep, brushing ash from its wool with methodical strokes.  Peter sits apart at first, then wordlessly brings over salvaged jars, setting them near Kellyn like an offering.

Jonathan (quiet, almost like a prayer):
“We keep the animals steady, we keep ourselves steady.”

Act VIII — The Wounds

Peter rolls his sleeve back, revealing a raw scrape from the climb. Kellyn cleans their hands, then the wound.  Then they take his arm and begins a slow, practiced myofascial release, pressing into the tension around the cut.  Alex watches, jaw tight, then forces himself to relax.

Jonathan returns with a bundle of herbs pulled from a crack in the rock.
Jonathan: “Bitter, but it’ll help the lungs.”
They steep the leaves in hot water, passing the cups hand to hand.

Act IX — The Breath

The four sit close, cups steaming. Ash still streaks their skin, but the warmth softens their shoulders.

Kellyn exhales slowly, then counts them into a steady breathing rhythm.  Estrella lowers her head to the circle, nostrils flaring, as if matching them.  For a moment, silence feels full — not with dread, but with presence.

Peter (low, almost surprised):
“I didn’t think I’d want to keep breathing after today. But I do.”

Act X — The Covenant of Rest

They spread woven mats on the ground.  Jonathan lies on his back, voice soft in the darkness:
Jonathan: “Stone can fall. Ash can choke. But we’ve seen worse. And still—here.”

Alex pulls Kellyn close under a blanket, his grip tight at first, then loosening as sleep edges in.

Peter shifts near Jonathan, their shoulders brushing.

Closing Image
Four figures lie in a close ring, animals gathered around them, ash still clinging faintly to skin and fabric. Firelight flickers against the rock, steady despite the wind.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire shook the ground beneath us, hoping to break what breath could not. But even ash on the skin could not smother covenant. Breath by breath, we held.”

Fade out.
End of Season 55.
