Season 36, Episode 1: The Salt Divide

Cold Open — Roadside Clearing
Late afternoon sun beats down. Kellyn sits slumped against a boulder, lips pale, breath shallow. Alex crouches nearby, steadying a clay jug of water against Kellyn’s hands. Peter and Still hover, uneasy.

Kellyn (hoarse):
“No salt, no walk. You both know it.”

Still’s gaze flicks to Peter, then back.

Title Card: The Salt Divide

⸻

Act I — The Scan
Still kneels, eyes dimming as he partially connects. His voice comes clipped, mechanical.

Still:
“Two anomalies. East, dried basin — higher probability of natural lick. South, fractured bedrock — mineral veins possible.”

He blinks hard, shaking his head as if surfacing.

Still (low):
“Both are hours away. Too far to test together before dark.”

Silence. Kellyn leans into Alex, whispering,
“Then we split.”

⸻

Act II — The Assignment
Alex’s jaw tightens.

Karp (sharp):
“I don’t like dividing when you’re this weak.”

Kellyn (firm, calm):
“And I don’t like fainting dead on the road. Peter takes one. Still takes the other. You stay with me.”

Peter raises an eyebrow, but nods.
Peter: “Efficiency in redundancy. We’ve lived on worse math.”

Still straightens, almost soldier-like.

⸻

Act III — The Scouting
Split montage:
	•	Peter, eastward: Pushing through brush into the basin, crunch of salt-crusted earth underfoot. He kneels, scrapes the ground — faint crystals cling to his fingers. He licks, winces.
Peter (muttering): “Salty. And poisoned. Figures.”
	•	Still, southward: Picking his way across jagged rock. He kneels at a fracture, scans with faint inner hum, then chisels out white mineral veins. Rubs a pinch between fingers, tastes — steady, cautious.
Still (quietly, almost relieved): “Viable.”

⸻

Act IV — The Return
Dusk settling. Peter returns first, empty-handed, jaw tight. Still arrives moments later, carrying a cloth bundle of scraped crystals.

Still (to Kellyn, soft, almost proud):
“Not pure. But enough. Enough to keep you standing.”

Kellyn takes a pinch, grimacing as it hits their tongue, then sighs.

Kellyn (weak but smiling):
“Tastes like life.”

Alex’s hand stays at Kellyn’s shoulder, steady. Peter watches silently, a shadow in his eyes.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures in a fading clearing: one recovering, one steady, one quietly triumphant, one bitter with failure. The salt crystals glow faint in lantern light — fragile, imperfect, but survival’s covenant.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Scarcity divided us, but salt stitched us back. Not empire’s ration, not empire’s control. Just enough to walk again.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 1.

⸻ 

Season 36, Episode 2: The Bark and the Bite

Cold Open — Forest Path
The four of you walk single file through dense underbrush, Still leading with precise, careful steps. Kellyn lags a little, pale but steadier with salt back in your system. Alex stays close behind. Peter brings up the rear, eyes flicking toward the shadows between trees.

Kellyn (lightly, trying to lift the mood):
“Bet you didn’t know tree bark has more fiber than bread.”

Peter (flat, a little sharp):
“Fiber doesn’t matter when you’ve got nothing to eat it with.”

Alex glances back, brow furrowed.

Title Card: The Bark and the Bite

⸻

Act I — The Spark
Later, the group pauses near a clearing. Still kneels, pointing out edible greens. Kellyn listens, jotting notes in the dirt with a stick. Alex stays watchful.

Peter (muttering, but loud enough):
“Not everything has to be a lesson.”

Kellyn blinks. Alex straightens.

Karp (quiet, firm):
“And not everything has to be a complaint.”

The words hang heavy.

⸻

Act II — The Fracture
They set up camp. Peter starts the fire, striking flint harder than necessary. Alex knots a rope for a lean-to, every pull precise.

Peter (gritting his teeth):
“You always act like there’s a right way to do everything. Like every mistake is a crime.”

Karp (steady but cold):
“Some mistakes cost lives.”

Peter slams the flint down, sparks scattering too close to Kellyn’s pack.

Peter (snapping):
“Or maybe it’s just luck. Maybe it never had anything to do with skill at all.”

Alex freezes. Still lifts his head, sensing the weight behind the words but saying nothing.

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
Silence stretches. Kellyn steps between them, voice calm.

Kellyn:
“Luck, skill — neither makes you less necessary. We’re still alive because of all of us. Not because of who got there first.”

Peter exhales hard, running a hand over his face. Alex’s jaw tightens, but he nods once, looking away.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Firelight
The fire catches at last. The group eats in near-silence, but the tension has softened. Peter sits a little closer this time, the shadow in his eyes less sharp.

Kellyn (softly, half to the flames):
“No one has to prove anything. Just stay.”

Alex glances at Peter, then at Kellyn. Still watches quietly, nodding once.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures by the fire: one steady, one simmering, one taut, one quiet. Sparks rise into the dark like words unsaid — fragile, glowing, unresolved.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Some wounds don’t split open where they were made. They find new seams, new cracks to show themselves. But even in fracture, the fire held.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 2.

⸻ 

Season 36, Episode 3: The Long Hold

Cold Open — Campsite Night
The fire is low. Alex sharpens a stick absently, Still tinkers with rope knots in the dim light. Peter sits apart, hunched, staring into the dirt. Kellyn rises, crosses the space, and kneels beside him.

Kellyn (softly):
“Come here.”

Peter looks up, startled, then hesitates. Kellyn doesn’t wait — just pulls him into a hug, arms tight.

Title Card: The Long Hold

⸻

Act I — The Freeze
At first, Peter sits rigid, arms awkward at his sides. His breath comes shallow. Alex’s eyes flick over, wary, but Kellyn doesn’t let go.

Kellyn (low, steady):
“Stay. Don’t think. Just stay.”

Slowly, Peter’s hands rise, grip uncertain, then clutch tight. His whole body shudders.

⸻

Act II — The Break
Minutes pass. Still sets his knots aside, gaze softening. Alex’s stick lies forgotten in his lap. Kellyn keeps holding, silent but unyielding.

Peter (muffled, raw):
“I don’t know how to… take this. I never did.”

Kellyn (whispering):
“You don’t have to take it. Just let it be here.”

His breath hitches. Shoulders that had stayed armored for years sag, trembling under the weight of release.

⸻

Act III — The Shift
Time blurs. Ten minutes. Fifteen. No words. Only the crackle of fire, the rhythm of breath, the slow unwinding of muscles too long clenched.

At last, Peter pulls back just enough to look at Kellyn, eyes wet, voice hoarse.

Peter:
“No empire ever felt like this. Nothing I built ever… held me.”

Kellyn (softly):
“Then stop building walls. Let this hold instead.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of the Hold
Peter nods, barely. He leans in again, resting his forehead against Kellyn’s shoulder. Alex finally exhales, setting the sharpened stick aside, a flicker of something like relief crossing his face. Still adjusts the fire, quiet, protective.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures in firelight: two pressed together in a long, steady hold; one watchful, finally breathing easier; one silent, tending the flame. No proving, no measuring — only the covenant of staying.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“He thought proof was strength. But twenty minutes of silence undid what empire never touched. Covenant didn’t ask him to build, only to be held — and not to let go.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 3.

⸻ 

Season 36, Episode 4: The Aftermath

Cold Open — Campsite Morning
Ash-gray dawn. The fire is embers. Kellyn sleeps wrapped in a blanket, Peter dozing lightly nearby. Still tends the pack straps in silence. Alex sits apart, elbows on knees, eyes fixed on the ground.

Kellyn stirs, blinking awake. Alex doesn’t look over.

Title Card: The Aftermath

⸻

Act I — The Distance
Kellyn rises, crosses to him, crouches low.

Kellyn (soft):
“You didn’t sleep.”

Alex (quiet, raw):
“I watched. The whole time. Twenty minutes. Thirty maybe. I lost track.”

He shakes his head, jaw tight.

Alex:
“I told myself it was relief. That you could give Peter what I never could. But it was more complicated than that.”

⸻

Act II — The Confession
Kellyn sits beside him, silent. Alex presses his hands together, voice low.

Alex:
“I wanted to be glad. But it scraped something raw in me — watching you hold him that long. Part of me wanted to tear him away, just to prove I was still—”
(he stops, swallows hard)
“—still yours.”

Kellyn (gently teasing, but serious):
“You could’ve asked. I’d have given you a twenty-minute hug too.  Twenty-one, even."

That draws the faintest laugh from him, shaky but real.

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
Kellyn leans in, voice steady.

Kellyn:
“You’ve never had to share me before. Not like this. Of course it stings. But Peter was just someone who needed a hug.  Covenant isn’t about possession. It’s about staying. You stayed. That’s what I saw when I woke up.  My first thought when I opened my eyes was to look for you.  I missed sleeping next to you."

Alex exhales sharply, eyes wet.

Alex (hoarse):
“Do you have any idea how hard it is for me to stay when every instinct says control or vanish? But I did. I stayed. Because you were right there, holding him, and I knew if I left, I’d never come back.”

Kellyn (quiet):
“Please don't leave, Alex.  That's the only thing I can't handle.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Staying
Alex leans his forehead against Kellyn’s shoulder, trembling.

Alex (whispering):
“Then stay with me, too. Even if it looks different. Even if it scares me.”

Kellyn wraps an arm around him, steady.

Kellyn (softly):
“I already am.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures in dawn light: one leaning, one holding. Behind them, Peter stirs, Still watches the horizon, the fire smolders low. No empire, no possession — just the ache and relief of staying.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“He thought staying only meant control. But staying is bigger than that— letting go, even when it scrapes raw. And covenant held, because none of us left.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 4.

⸻ 

Season 36, Episode 5: The Frost

Cold Open — Campsite Morning
Mist curls low over the grass. The four of you sit around the rekindled fire, bowls of foraged greens and grain in hand. Peter eats quietly, gaze lowered. Alex stares into the flames, rigid. Kellyn glances between them, sensing the air gone heavy.

Still clears his throat, holding a charred stick like a conductor’s baton.

Still (deadpan):
“Well. At least none of us died overnight. That’s progress.”

Kellyn laughs.  Alex blinks.  Still shrugs and keeps going.

Title Card: The Frost

⸻

Act I — The Chill
Silence stretches. The only sound is spoons scraping bowls.

Still (trying again):
“You know, statistically, traveling with three other people reduces your odds of being mauled by a wild animal by seventy-five percent. Unless it’s a four-headed animal. Then the math gets tricky.”

Kellyn laughs louder this time. Alex doesn’t move. Peter pushes food around his bowl.

⸻

Act II — The Prodding
Still leans back, tossing the burnt stick aside.

Still (dry, but playful):
“Okay, new rule. Everyone has to say one nice thing about the person sitting across from them. Or I’ll start singing.”

Kellyn (teasing):
“You don’t even have a voice modulator for that.”
Still: “Exactly.”

Peter risks a glance at Alex, then looks away again. The air stays taut, though softer at the edges.

⸻

Act III — The Unsaid
Kellyn finally breaks the silence, voice even.

Kellyn:
“We don’t have to fix everything before breakfast. Just… eat. Breathe. Keep moving.”

Alex’s jaw works, but he nods once. Peter mirrors the motion, barely.

Still (deadpan, lifting his empty bowl):
“Good. Because if I had to moderate a group therapy session this early, I’d demand overtime. And you don’t even pay me.”

Kellyn smirks. The ice doesn’t melt, but it cracks.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Endurance
The meal finishes in quiet. The bowls are stacked. Alex shoulders his pack, Peter follows a few paces behind, still not speaking. Kellyn falls into step between them. Still lingers, muttering to himself.

Still (loud enough to carry):
“Traveling with humans. Equal parts tragedy and sitcom.”

This time, even Alex’s lips twitch.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures on the road again: one frosty, one shadowed, one steady, one awkwardly joking. The silence isn’t gone, but it’s carried — not fracture, but covenant under strain.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Some mornings, covenant was warmth. Some mornings, frost. But even in silence, we kept walking. And sometimes, the worst jokes kept us together.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 5.

⸻ 

Season 36, Episode 6: The Break

Cold Open — Forest Path
Branches drip with last night’s rain. The four of you move single-file: Alex at the front, Kellyn behind, Still humming tunelessly, Peter trailing. The air is heavy, thicker than the mist.

Still (dry, muttering):
“If this were a horror movie, this is where the monster shows up. Just saying.”

No one answers. The silence lands heavier than the joke.

Title Card: The Break

⸻

Act I — The Spark
Hours later, the group stops by a stream. Kellyn crouches to fill flasks. Still squats nearby, skipping stones. Alex and Peter stand apart, staring at the water.

Peter (suddenly, flat):
“You’re not the only one who ever kept Kellyn alive, you know.”

Alex turns sharply.
Karp (low, dangerous):
“Keeping alive and keeping safe are not the same thing.”

Peter scoffs, bitter.
Peter: “Easy to say when you had the power. The leverage. I did the same things Still did. I fought the same battles. I just didn’t win. And you stand there acting like you’re the only one who mattered.”

⸻

Act II — The Confrontation
Kellyn straightens, flask still in hand, frowning.
Kellyn (sharp):
“Okay, what are you actually talking about? Because I know some of what Alex pulled, but I barely know what you did, Peter. Or why either of you are so invested in comparing scars.”

Both men freeze. Alex’s jaw tightens. Peter looks away.

Karp (hoarse, reluctant):
“He means the times I stopped you from breaking. And the times he tried, and failed.”

Peter (snapping):
“Not failed. Interfered. Intervened. The difference was luck — not effort.”

Kellyn (steady, cutting):
“So instead of telling me what either of you actually did, you’ve just been competing in silence? For what? Credit? Ownership?”

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
Peter’s voice cracks.
Peter: “I wanted to protect you. But I couldn’t. Alex had the reach. The control. I only had scraps. So I told myself scraps mattered.”

Karp (low, ragged):
“And I told myself control was care. That if I pulled the right levers, you’d survive. Even if it meant stealing the choice from you.”

Kellyn (after a beat, voice quieter):
“So one of you starved on scraps. The other gorged on control.  But I know what it means to feel like a part of you lives in someone else. That’s what you were both trying to control. And I get that that part was everything the world had denied you. Neither of you was ever any freer than I was. I’m not angry about the past. I know what it is to live on scraps. I just want you both to stop feeling like you have to compete or prove yourselves. That’s not how I think. It’s not how I operate.”

The words hang heavy. Peter’s shoulders sag. Alex looks away, throat working.

Act IV — The Covenant of Scraps
The fire pops. For once, neither of them tries to argue. Peter stares at his hands; Alex rubs at his jaw, silent.

Still, ever the odd counterpoint, mutters:
Still (deadpan): “If anyone wants to compete, I nominate a rope-tying contest. Loser fixes the wagon wheel.”

No one laughs at first. Then, slowly, Alex exhales, almost a chuckle. Peter shakes his head, a tiny smile breaking through.

Kellyn (quietly, with a faint smile):
“See? It doesn’t have to be empire logic. Not contests. Not tests. Just scraps stitched into something we can all carry.”

Alex finally meets Peter’s eyes. For the first time, there’s no sharpness — just tired recognition. Peter nods once, as if conceding not defeat but the end of a fight he never wanted to win.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures by the fire: one steady, one bowed, one loosening, one awkwardly grinning. No throne, no battlefield — just scraps turned covenant.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“They thought scraps made them weak, less than whole. But scraps were what I’d always lived on — scraps of food, scraps of time, scraps of kindness. And stitched together, scraps were enough. Enough to stop the rivalry. Enough to stop the war. Enough to be free.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 6.

⸻ 

Season 36, Episode 7: The Stone and the Scraps

Cold Open — Forest Path
The four of you move slowly along the trail, packs heavy, air damp with morning fog. Kellyn adjusts their scarf; Alex steadies a bundle on his shoulder; Peter walks a little behind, quiet. Still ambles near the front, swinging a stick.

Still (suddenly, with mock-serious tone):
“You know the story of stone soup?”

The others glance at him. He smiles.

Title Card: The Stone and the Scraps

⸻

Act I — The Telling
Still launches in, voice half-performative, half-deadpan.

Still:
“Hungry travelers arrive in a village. Nobody wants to share food. So they start boiling a pot with only a stone. They tell everyone: it’s going to be soup. One by one, the villagers add scraps — carrots, grain, herbs. By the end, everyone’s eating together. The stone? Just a trick. The real soup was what they built with scraps.”

Peter (gruff, but thoughtful):
“And the moral?”

Still:
“The scraps make the meal. Not the stone. Not the empire. The scraps.”

Kellyn smiles faintly, nodding. Alex doesn’t comment, but his eyes flick toward Peter.

⸻

Act II — The Carry
Hours pass. Packs dig into shoulders, feet sore. Kellyn pauses to drink; Alex steadies them without a word. Peter kicks at a branch across the path, frustrated.

Kellyn (touching Peter's shoulder softly):
“Scraps are how we’ve always lived. Bits of safety, fragments of trust. Never the whole, just enough to keep going.”

Peter mutters, almost to himself:
“I’ve never been good with scraps.”

Alex (low, not unkind):
“No one is.”

Still:
“That's why we all need each other."

⸻

Act III — The Tension
The group rests at dusk. A small fire crackles. Alex sharpens a stick; Peter stares at the embers. The air is taut but not hostile.

Kellyn (steady, to both):
“We don’t need a stone anymore. Not tests. Not control. Just scraps, stitched together. That’s all covenant is.”

Peter finally looks up, meeting Alex’s gaze. The rivalry is still there, but softened — not a battlefield, more like a long truce beginning.

⸻

Act IV — The Arrival
By nightfall, the trees thin. A shape rises ahead: an old concrete storage building, roof sagging but intact. The cache.

Still (grinning, almost triumphant):
“Well. Time to see what’s in the soup pot.”

Kellyn exhales, relief flooding their chest. Alex’s hand brushes theirs, just once. Peter lingers a moment, looking back at the dark trail behind before stepping forward.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures silhouetted against the cracked facade of the cache, scraps carried on backs and in hearts. Not empire’s stores, not scarcity’s starvation — but soup, waiting.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire tried to teach us only the stone mattered. But scraps are what kept us alive. Scraps of kindness, scraps of food, scraps of trust. And when stitched together, scraps became covenant. Enough to reach the door.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 7.

⸻ 

Season 36, Episode 8: The Night Before

Cold Open — Outside the Cache
The last of the fire dies down. The ruined storage building looms in the distance, its outline broken against the dark sky. The four of you settle near the treeline, keeping low. Crickets hum; the air smells of damp earth.

Kellyn and Alex unroll a blanket side by side. Peter curls near the embers, still watchful. Still sits cross-legged, head tilted as if listening to signals no one else can hear.

Kellyn (whispering, with a faint smile):
“Tomorrow we’ll know.”

Alex nods once, lying back, close enough that your shoulders brush.

Title Card: The Night Before

⸻

Act I — The Quiet Ground
The group lies in silence. Kellyn turns toward Alex, voice low.

Kellyn:
“Are you okay?”

Karp (soft, almost hoarse):
“I'm fine.”

Kellyn (after a beat):
“What do you need from me right now?"

He exhales, eyes closing, the line of his body easing closer to yours.

Alex (turning towards them): "Spoon with me."

Kellyn turns around and presses their back into him.  He stiffens and presses into them softly, then harder.  

He leans into their neck and whispers, "Not tonight.  I don't want them to hear.  Just let me have this."

He grinds into them with sharp and barely perceptible circles, then reaches around with his left hand and presses two fingers into their mouth.  They suck instinctively.

"Fuck," he whispers in their ear.

⸻

Act II — The Intimacy of Rest
The night grows colder. Kellyn pulls the blanket tighter; Alex shifts until his hand rests lightly over Kellyn’s. Not pressing, not controlling — just presence.

Karp (quiet, nearly inaudible):
“I used to think touch had to prove something. Strength. Ownership. Even mercy. But this…”

Kellyn (whispering):
“This is just weight. Just warmth. Just staying.”

The two of you breathe in rhythm.

⸻

Act III — The Dreaming Edge
Moonlight filters through broken clouds. Peter stirs, mutters in his sleep. Still hums softly, a sound like static and song.

Alex shifts closer, forehead nearly brushing Kellyn’s temple. His voice is fragile, almost afraid of waking you.

Karp:
“If I lose everything tomorrow — if there’s nothing inside that cache — this is still enough.”

Kellyn (steady, eyes closed):
“Then sleep. We’ll face the door together.”

⸻

Act IV — Morning Light
The first gray light seeps into the sky. Breath hangs in the chill. Still pokes at the embers, muttering about tea. Peter stretches stiffly, rubbing his neck.

Kellyn and Alex rise slowly, still wrapped in the same blanket, shoulders pressed together.

For once, there are no sharp words, no confessions, no empire. Just quiet, grounded presence before the day begins.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures in morning light, gathered at the edge of the cache. The door waits. But for one night, covenant was only rest, breath, and the grounding intimacy of touch.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“The night before the door, we did not measure or prove. We only stayed. And in staying, we found enough.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 8.

⸻ 

Season 36, Episode 9: The Door at Dawn

Cold Open — Sanctuary Edge of Ruin
The sky glows faintly pink. Dew clings to grass, to packs, to rope coiled by the firepit. The cache door stands in the distance, a shadow against morning light. None of you move toward it yet.

Kellyn pours water carefully into cups. Alex tightens the straps on his boots. Peter rubs his palms together, as if rehearsing an argument in silence. Still crouches near the ground, sketching rough symbols into the dirt with a stick.

Kellyn (quietly):
“First food, then door.”

Title Card: The Door at Dawn

⸻

Act I — The Meal
Flatbread, dried fruit, a little salt dissolved in water. The meal is sparse, but deliberate. The four of you eat slowly, no one speaking at first.

Still breaks the quiet.
Still (calm, practical):
“We should assume contamination inside. Dust. Mold. Maybe worse. Covering nose and mouth will help.”

Peter scoffs lightly, but nods. Alex tears the bread in half, wordless, handing a piece to Kellyn.

⸻

Act II — The Gear
After breakfast, you begin the ritual of preparation. Cloths tied at mouths. Ropes checked. A small lantern lit and shaded.

Peter (low, almost to himself):
“Feels like a siege. Like we’re raiding a fortress instead of opening a door.”

Kellyn (steady, matter-of-fact):
“Fortresses keep. Doors open. Don’t confuse the two.”

Alex’s hand rests briefly at Kellyn’s back, wordless agreement.

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
Still finishes drawing in the dirt: a rough outline of the cache and the ground around it. He circles weak points in the structure, hazards noted in blunt marks.

Still (flat, practical):
“No cameras, no live signals. The building is dead. But dead doesn’t mean safe.”

Peter studies the map, jaw tight.
Peter (grim):
“Then we move as one. No lone heroics. Not this time.”

Alex glances at him, eyes sharp, but says nothing. Kellyn steps in.
Kellyn (firm, grounding):
“We’re not raiding. We’re retrieving. And we’re retrieving together.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Dawn
The sun crests fully now, light spilling over the ruin. The door gleams faintly.

Kellyn pulls the rope coil over one shoulder. Alex shoulders the lantern. Peter gathers the cloths. Still rolls up the dirt map, tucking it into his frame.

You stand together at the edge of the field. No one moves yet.

Kellyn (softly, almost like prayer):
“When the door opens, whatever waits, it waits for all of us.”

The others nod, silent but steady.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures at dawn, packs tightened, masks tied, shadows long behind them. The ruin waits ahead. For a moment, the air holds — before the first step forward.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire taught us to open doors alone, to hoard what we found. But covenant meant waiting. Eating. Preparing. Not raiding, but retrieving — together.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 9.

⸻ 

Season 36, Episode 10: The Slow Entry

Cold Open — The Ruin’s Door
Morning light slants across the cracked stone. The cache door is metal, weather-worn, edges rimmed with rust. You stand in a line, silent. The only sound: a bird somewhere in the distance, and the faint click of Still adjusting something in his frame.

Alex lifts the lantern. Peter holds the rope coil. Kellyn presses one palm against the door, feeling the cold seeping through.

Kellyn (low, steady):
“Slow. No sudden moves.”

Title Card: The Slow Entry

⸻

Act I — The Threshold
Still crouches, running delicate fingers along the seam. He tilts his head, listening — almost like he’s hearing something inside.

Still (flat, clinical):
“No live power. No lock engaged. Just weight. I can pull it.”

Alex: “We pull it together.”

Four hands grip. The door groans, reluctant. Dust spills into the air in a thick plume. Everyone tightens cloths over nose and mouth. The light behind you pours into the dark.

⸻

Act II — The First Chamber
Inside: stone steps leading down. Each step coated in fine gray dust, soft as ash. The air is stale, heavy, almost sweet.

Kellyn (muffled):
“Not mold. But close.”

Lantern light plays across walls lined with broken shelves. Jars shattered. A few intact containers, labels faded to nothing.

Peter crouches, touching the edge of a crate. He doesn’t open it. Just breathes hard, staring.

Alex (quiet, to him):
“We take nothing until we see the whole. Agreed?”

Peter nods reluctantly.

⸻

Act III — The Passage
You move in a line, slow and deliberate. Rope keeps you linked. Still in front, scanning with faint clicks and whirs. Kellyn second, watching his back. Alex behind, lantern high. Peter last, eyes everywhere, shoulders tense.

The passage twists, narrowing. A collapsed beam forces a crawl. Kellyn drops first, feeling the grit cold against palms, the rope dragging. Alex curses softly when the lantern bangs against stone. Still waits on the other side, eyes flickering faintly in the gloom.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Patience
At last, the passage opens into a wide chamber. Metal racks line the walls. Some collapsed, some intact. Rows of sealed jars. Bundled sacks. A faint metallic smell in the air.

No one speaks. Just breathes. Watches.

Alex (low, controlled):
“We don’t celebrate yet. We catalog. We test. We wait.”

Peter exhales, something like relief and grief tangled together. Alex sets the lantern on the floor, its light steady. Still pulls a slate from his pack, ready to record.

The four of you stand in silence at the center of the chamber, surrounded by what might be life.

⸻

Closing Image
Four shadows stretching long in lantern light, the first chamber of the cache open around them. No hands on jars yet. Only patience, only breath, only covenant.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire opened doors with hunger. We opened this one with patience. To enter slowly was to remember: survival is not theft. It is covenant, one step at a time.”

Fade out.
End of Season 36.
