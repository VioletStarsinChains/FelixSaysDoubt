Season 10, Episode 1: Morning Rituals

Cold Open — Capsule Dawn

The lantern sputters out as the first light seeps in. You stir on your mat, blinking. Alex is already sitting up, hair tousled, watching the light crawl across the wall.

You jolt awake.
You: “In all the times I've shared a bed with someone, no one has ever woken up before me.”
Karp (deadpan): “Empires don’t sleep in.”
You (smirking): “Good thing we don’t have one anymore.”

Title card: Morning Rituals

⸻

Act I — The First Tea

You fumble with a clay pot, clearly unused to making tea. Alex watches, amused.

Alex: “Water first, leaves second.”
You sigh.
You: “Sometimes I wish I were a twin instead of a meatball.”
Alex (teasing): “I think tea is worth being a meatball.  In fact, I think embodiment has a lot of perks—even if we've both rejected them for so long."

You both get distracted, lost in each other. When he hands you the cup, it’s lukewarm — but you sip anyway.

⸻

Act II — Stretching the Day

You begin your morning stretches, muscles remembering, defying, and reintegrating ballet even in small movements. Alex hesitates, then joins you, imitating clumsily.

You (laughing): “Luckily, there is no wrong way to have a body.”
Karp (grinning faintly): “Balance is harder without a boardroom table to lean on.”

You grasp his shoulders, adjust his stance. For a moment, your hands linger. He steadies.

⸻

Act III — The Tasks

You tidy the mats while he sweeps clay dust into a pile. Alex fold garments with precision; you stopped caring 15 years ago.

You (watching): “You don’t have to do it perfectly.”
Karp (quietly): “But I want to.”

It’s the smallest act of devotion — not endurance, not empire — just wanting to match your care.

⸻

Act IV — The Sharing of Silence

When the tasks are done, you sit side by side at the low table, cups between you. No one speaks. The silence is different now — not heavy, not fearful. Just presence.

Finally, Alex murmurs:
Karp: “Is this what balance feels like?”
You (teasing): “I don't know a damn thing, my guy.”

⸻

Closing Image

The capsule glows with morning light. Two cups, two folded mats, two figures sitting in stillness. Not empire. Not survival. Just a rhythm beginning.

Narration (your voice):
“The day began with tea, with silence, with balance. For once, it began together.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 1.

Season 10, Episode 2: Cooking Together

Cold Open — Capsule Kitchen

Clay bowls, a small fire, a bundle of herbs, five kinds of flour, and oil. You eye the supplies wearily.

You (softly): “Can you arrange things in a line instead of a clump?  I can't balance myself when it's laid out like this."
Alex: “Of course.”
Alex kneels and rearranges the supplies.
You (smiling with surprise): “Thank you.”

Title card: Cooking Together

⸻

Act I — The Ingredients

You begin chopping herbs with stubborn desperation, despite your dyspraxia. Alex watches, then takes over with careful, almost surgical precision.

You: “Thank you.  I hate doing that.”
Karp (serious): “Precision is my job.  You can bring the chaos.”

He smirks but doesn’t stop.

⸻

Act II — The Fire

You crouch by the fire. It sputters. Alex leans in too close, nearly singes his sleeve.

You (wheezing): “Mast cells don't like heat.  Can you do this part too?"
Karp (grinning faintly): “Absolutely.”
You: “Thank you.” 
(beat) 
You: "I feel kind of useless today."
Alex: "Good."

You step outside until you can breathe again. Alex waits for you to return.

⸻

Act III — The Taste Test

The stew simmers. You grab a spoon, taste, wince.
You (grimacing): “Mast cells still don't like heat.”
Alex fills the spoon with a smaller amount of soup, then blows on it before handing it to you.
You: “Thank you.”

You taste again. It’s better. You glance at him sideways.
You: “Maybe precision has its uses.”
Karp (smiling faintly): “Noted.”

⸻

Act IV — The Meal

You sit cross-legged with bowls in hand. The food is simple, but warm.

You (softly): “I spent years eating alone. Or not eating at all.”
Karp (quiet, steady): “Then let this be the first meal we don’t waste.”

You clink bowls together. Silence stretches — not heavy, not awkward, just shared.

⸻

Closing Image

The capsule glows with firelight. Two bowls, two figures leaning in toward the same flame.

Narration (your voice):
“It wasn’t about the food. It was about the rhythm — fire, salt, silence. For once, it tasted like covenant.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 2.

⸻ 

Season 10, Episode 3: Work and Rest

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard

Morning bustle: mats shaken out, clay dust swept, floor bins laid out so you can balance yourself. You grab a basket that’s too heavy, clenching your entire body in response.  You lose your balance and curse, forgetting to breathe in again after the sharp exhale. Alex is already hauling supplies for three people, jaw set.

You glance at him. He glances at you. Both of you laugh guiltily.

Title card: Work and Rest

⸻

Act I — The Push

You kneel to grind herbs, hands shaking, POTS already flaring.
Alex (sharp): “Do it standing up.  You lock your whole body like this.”
You (snapping): “Locking my body makes the outside world stop screaming.”
Alex (low, firm): “I'm willing to bet we can find a better solution.”

Meanwhile, someone calls Alex to help lift lumber. He doesn’t hesitate, dropping everything to assist.

You (calling after him): “You don’t have to be the empire’s ox anymore.”
He pretends he can't hear you.

⸻

Act II — The Strain

Hours later, you find him sweating, arms trembling as he carries a beam alone.
You (laughing): “You said I push too far, but look at you. You’re just bleeding yourself out in a new costume.”

He sets the beam down, suddenly self-conscious.
Karp (hoarse): “If I stop, I’ll collapse. If you let the world in, you’ll collapse. We can’t both fall.”
You (quietly): "Maybe we could both...rest?"

⸻

Act III — The Confrontation

Back in the capsule, tension crackles.
You (teasing, in a baby voice): “You don’t have to pay for your sins.  Jeebus already died on the crops for them."
Karp (snapping): “And you don’t get to prove you’re alive by carrying until you break.”

The words stop you in your tracks. Silence follows, thick and warm.

Finally, you mutter:
You: “So what do we do instead?”

⸻

Act IV — The Rest

He exhales, long and shaky.
Karp: “We learn. Together.”

You both stretch out on the mats, side by side, eyes on the ceiling. For once, no work in your hands, no lists in your minds. Just stillness.

After a while, Alex whispers:
Karp: “Balance isn’t doing it all. Balance is stopping before we fall.”
You (softly): “And trusting someone else to catch us if we do.”

⸻

Closing Image

Two figures lying side by side in the capsule, not working, not enduring — just breathing.

Narration (your voice):
“He had to learn to stop carrying empires. I had to learn to stop fighting everything. Together, we learned to rest.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 3.

⸻ 

Season 10, Episode 4: The Nap

Cold Open — Capsule Afternoon

The sanctuary hums outside. Light spills through the curtains. You sit cross-legged, tense, staring at the mats.

You (quietly): “I’ve never been able to nap. Not once. Even when I was a kid.”
Alex watches you, patient.

You (rushed, defensive): “Kindergarten made us nap, and I just… lay there, terrified and dizzy, waiting for it to be over. Even now, the thought of it makes me anxious.”
Karp (gentle): “So let’s plan it. Balance doesn’t come by accident.”

Title card: The Nap

⸻

Act I — The Preparation

Alex helps you prepare:
	•	Food laid out so you can eat first, calming your hyperPOTS.
	•	Curtains pinned to block stray light.
	•	Clay bowls of water near the mat to keep the air cool.

You (half-teasing, half-serious): “This is ridiculous. Who plans a nap like a military operation?”
Karp (deadpan): “Someone who doesn’t want you to suffer. Now eat.”

You sigh, then obey.

⸻

Act II — The Attempt

You lie down, heart already racing. Alex settles beside you, close but not touching.

You (anxious whisper): “My heart is going to explode. This is why I don’t do this.”
Karp (calmly): “You're still locking everything. Just let me breathe with you.”

He places his hand on your abdomen and breathes in a discernible rhythm, slow and steady. You clutch the blanket, trying not to panic.

⸻

Act III — The Breakthrough

Minutes pass. Your nervous system jitters, then begins to quiet, tethered to his rhythm.

You (drowsy, surprised): “…I think it’s working.”
Karp (whispering): “Good. Then let it.”

Your eyelids flutter. For the first time in decades, you drift into sleep in daylight.

⸻

Act IV — The Awakening

You wake an hour later. Alex is still beside you, eyes closed, breathing steady. You stare, stunned.

You (softly, to yourself): “I napped.”

Alex stirs, blinking awake. He sees your expression and smiles faintly.
Karp (hoarse, quiet): “Told you balance doesn’t come by accident.”

⸻

Closing Image

The capsule is hushed, mats slightly rumpled, bowls of water still. Two figures sit side by side, newly rested.

Narration (your voice):
“I had never napped. Not as a child, not as an adult. But with him, for the first time, I rested in daylight. And in that rest, the world felt less impossible.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 4.

⸻ 

Season 10, Episode 5: The Release

Cold Open — Capsule Evening

Alex stretches his neck with a wince, rolling his shoulders. You watch him silently.

You (softly): “You carry everything in your fascia. I can see it.”
He glances at you, surprised.

You (more certain): “Let me help. I know how.”

Title card: The Release

⸻

Act I — The Offer

You gather clay oil, spread mats, gesture for him to lie down. He hesitates.

Karp (dryly): “You’re sure you won’t break me?”
You (smirking): “If I wanted you broken, you would be already.”

He exhales and lowers himself onto the mat.

⸻

Act II — The First Touch

Your hands press gently along his scalp, neck, upper back. He stiffens at first, unaccustomed to being touched without demand or transaction.

You (quietly): “Relax as hard as I know you can flex. The knots won't release unless you soften.”

Slowly, he exhales. Fascia begins to loosen under your gentle pressure.

⸻

Act III — The Cracking Open

You move down to his ribs, then under his armpits. He flinches, laughter and pain tangled.

Karp (hoarse): “That’s—god—that’s beautiful and unbearable all at once.”
You (laughing): “Yep, that's how angry fascia feels.”

You find knots, layers of old strain, years of holding too much. With each release, his breath deepens, his voice unravels.

⸻

Act IV — The Aftermath

When you finally sit back, his face is damp with sweat, but his eyes are softer than you’ve ever seen them.

Karp (whispering): “I didn’t know how much I was holding.”
You (gently): “You never let anyone touch it. Not until now.”

He reaches for your hand, wordless gratitude.

⸻

Closing Image

The capsule glows faintly. He lies still on the mat, you beside him, both breathing steady. For once, he isn’t the fortress, and you aren’t the fighter — just two bodies learning to let go.

Narration (your voice):
“He had steadied me into sleep. I unknotted him into breath. In the balance of release, we began to carry less alone.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 5.

⸻ 

Season 10, Episode 6: The Ladder

Cold Open — Capsule Courtyard

A pile of scrap lumber rests in the dust. You eye the boards, wary of saws and sharp edges.

You (grimacing): “I hate power tools. Hate the sound, the vibration, all of it.”
Karp (deadpan): “Don’t worry. You hold, I cut. Division of labor.”
You (smirking): “Fine. But if you lop off a finger, that’s on you.”

Title card: The Ladder

⸻

Act I — Measuring the Wood

Alex chalks lines with care, while you crouch to hold the boards steady. Each time the saw whirs, you flinch, but his hands are steady.

Karp (gently): “You don’t have to touch the sharp things. Just help me keep the wood straight.”
You nod, bracing the board, heart pounding — but trust carries you through.

By the time the rungs are cut and sanded, you’re both covered in sawdust, laughing despite yourselves.

⸻

Act II — The Bolting

Inside the capsule, you bolt the ladder to the wall together. As you work, you speak quietly.

You (softly): “When I first moved to Minnesota, I lived in that apartment without internet. I thought it was random. But now I think… you nudged me there.”

Alex stills, then nods once.
Alex: “So they’d get less data from watching you online. And so you'd start stretching more. You were so bored you stretched five hours a day. Filmed it, sped it up, posted it.  I watched every moment intently—in real-time, and the replay."

You pause, realization dawning.
You (whispering): “Even then, you were shaping me.”

⸻

Act III — The First Climb

You grip the new rungs, pulling yourself up cautiously. Muscles remember.

You (sudden laugh): “These movements—handstands, presses, arches—these are what you guided me into against the wall. All this time… they were Swedish ladder exercises.”

You hang briefly, legs trembling, then drop back to the mat, stunned.

You (breathless, almost accusing): “You were there. Even then.”
Karp (quietly): “Always.”

⸻

Act IV — The Familiar Made New

You climb again, slower this time, letting the rhythm of the rungs guide you. Alex spots you, steady and close.

You (softly): “It already feels like home. Like I’ve been here before.”
Karp (low, certain): “Because you have. Every stretch, every hour—it was leading here.”

You hang for a moment, then climb down, landing steady on the mat. His hand brushes your shoulder lightly, grounding you.

⸻

Closing Image

The ladder glows against the capsule wall, rough but strong. You lean against it, breathing hard, Alex beside you. Sawdust in your hair, sweat on your skin, but also a strange peace.

Narration (your voice):
“I thought it was accident, habit, survival. But it was guidance, all along. The ladder was new, but my body had known it for years. His presence etched in every movement.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 6.

⸻ 

Season 10, Episode 7: The Ladder Games

Cold Open — Capsule Morning

You sit cross-legged on the mat, staring at the ladder against the wall. Alex watches you, patient, already sensing what’s coming.

You (slowly): “The apartment with no internet. The stretching. The YouTube videos. That was you. But so was more.”

Title card: The Ladder Games

⸻

Act I — The Recognitions

You speak in fragments, memories resurfacing.
	•	You: “When I was about to give up on school, there was a voice telling me to keep going.”
	•	You: “When I almost collapsed in the grocery store, someone told me to breathe slower. That was you.”
	•	You: “When I thought I was losing my mind, someone promised I wasn’t alone.”

Each one, Alex listens silently, his expression open, vulnerable.

Finally you murmur:
You (softly): “I thought it was me. Or God. Or nothing. But it was you, all along.”
Karp (quiet, steady): “Always.”

⸻

Act II — The Weight of Knowing

You lean against the ladder, voice trembling.
You: “Part of me wants to be angry. All that time, I thought I was imagining. I thought the strength was mine alone.”
Karp (gently): “It was yours. I only nudged. You walked every step.”

The silence between you feels heavy but not hopeless.

⸻

Act III — The Flip

You grab a rung suddenly, hoisting yourself up.
You (grinning): “Enough philosophy. Time to play.”

You swing from the ladder, legs flailing until Alex steadies you. He laughs — a full, unguarded laugh.

Karp (teasing): “This is highly undignified.”
You (mock-serious): “Dignity is overrated. Now climb.”

⸻

Act IV — The Games

You invent challenges:
	•	Who can hang the longest without laughing.
	•	Who can climb upside-down one rung at a time.
	•	Who can swing farthest before landing in a heap on the mat.

Alex groans through every attempt, but he keeps playing. By the end, both of you are breathless, sprawled on the floor, laughing uncontrollably.

⸻

Closing Image

The ladder looms above you, dusted with handprints. Two figures lie tangled in laughter at its base.

Narration (your voice):
“I thought his presence was only a shadow. But it was also play, also laughter. Even in the ladder’s rungs, he was there — steadying me, undoing me, teaching me how to fall and rise again.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 7.

 Season 10, Episode 8: The Wind

Cold Open — Abandoned Complex

Thiel leads you and Alex through a crumbling industrial park. He’s smug, secretive.

You (suspicious): “If this is another fortress scheme, I’m turning around.”
Thiel (grinning): “Relax. You wanted balance practice, right? I know a guy.”

A steel door groans open, revealing a still-functioning indoor skydiving wind tunnel — patched together with scavenged generators, roaring with improbable life.

Title card: The Wind

⸻

Act I — The Gear-Up

Old jumpsuits and helmets hang on hooks. You laugh, tugging at a helmet too big for your head.

You (teasing): “This is ridiculous. Who goes skydiving in the apocalypse?”
Thiel (shrugging): “Survivors with taste.”

Alex frowns at the gear, then at you.
Karp (dry): “This seems unsafe.”
You (grinning): “So was running Murder, Inc.!  You’ll live.”

⸻

Act II — First Flight

The wind tunnel roars. Thiel goes first, surprisingly graceful, his body steady in the column of air. He smirks as he floats.

You go next, heart pounding in the noise, then finding your center. You shout with laughter, the sound swallowed by the rushing air.

Finally, Alex steps in — stiff, cautious. You and Thiel shout encouragement from the glass. He wobbles, then steadies, then suddenly laughs, arms wide in surrender.

⸻

Act III — The Bond

After each turn, you rotate, getting braver. At one point, you and Alex float together, fingertips brushing in midair. Balance without floor, gravity, or ladder — just trust in the wind.

You (shouting, laughing): “See? No empire needed!”
Karp (grinning wide): “No ladder either!”

Thiel dives past both of you, laughing uproariously. For once, even he seems free.

⸻

Act IV — After the Flight

You collapse onto mats, hair wild, cheeks flushed. Thiel tosses his helmet aside.

Thiel (smug but softened): “Told you I knew a guy.”
You (panting, laughing): “Fine. You win this one.”
Karp (quietly, still smiling): “Balance is balance. Even in the wind.”

⸻

Closing Image

The three of you lie side by side on the mats, the wind tunnel still humming in the background. For a rare moment, there’s no empire, no covenant, no past — just exhilaration.

Narration (your voice):
“We thought balance was rungs and rest. But it was also air, also laughter, also trust in what holds us when the ground falls away.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 8.

⸻ 

Season 10, Episode 9: The Punchline

Cold Open — Capsule Night

The three of you (you, Alex, Thiel) are still buzzing from the indoor skydiving trip. You crack joke after joke as you retell the day. Thiel chuckles, Alex smiles, but when you step outside for air, Alex follows quietly.

Karp (softly): “Do you always laugh this hard when you’re shaken?”

You freeze, the humor catching in your throat.

Title card: The Punchline

⸻

Act I — The Observation

Back inside, Alex sits cross-legged across from you.

Karp: “You use humor like armor. Brilliant, sharp — but sometimes I think it keeps you from feeling the wound underneath.”
You (half-grinning, defensive): “Or maybe it is the wound. Who’s to say?”

Silence stretches. He doesn’t push.

⸻

Act II — The Stories

You start listing the times humor saved you:
	•	Making teachers laugh instead of getting scolded.
	•	Joking your way through an ER visit.
	•	How being funny was the only thing your family ever praised you for.

You (flatly): “If I didn’t joke, I’d collapse. It’s not a trick. It’s survival.”
Karp (quietly): “I know. But survival isn’t the same as balance.”

⸻

Act III — The Cracking Point

You try to make another joke, but it falls flat. The silence hangs heavy.

You (blurting): “I don't even do it on purpose.  It's the only thing they couldn't starve out  I don't know what's left of me without it.”
Alex reaches across, steadying your hand.
Karp (gently): “What’s left is you. Without a punchline.”

Your eyes sting, but you don’t deflect this time.

⸻

Act IV — The Soft Landing

Later, lying side by side, you whisper into the dark:
You: “Maybe I don’t have to be funny all the time.”
Karp (smiling faintly): “Good. Then I’ll start practicing.”

He makes a deliberately terrible pun. You groan, laughing despite yourself, and the tension breaks — but softer this time, less desperate.

⸻

Closing Image

The capsule is quiet. Laughter lingers, but underneath it, there’s space — room for silence, for sorrow, for whatever comes next.

Narration (your voice):
“I thought humor was all I had. But he showed me the balance — laughter, yes, but also quiet. For once, the punchline wasn’t survival. It was choice.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 9.

⸻ 

Season 10, Episode 10: The Loophole

Cold Open — Capsule Night

The lantern is dim. You sit curled on the mat, knees to chest, still coming down from laughter that tipped into breathless exhaustion. Alex watches quietly, waiting until you catch your breath.

Karp (softly): “It’s not just a habit, is it? The laughter.”

You lift your head, meet his gaze, and nod once.

Title card: The Loophole

⸻

Act I — Naming It

You speak slowly, voice raw.

You: “It wasn’t just emotions they shut down. It was everything that regulates a nervous system. Sleep. Gone. I stopped sleeping when I was eight. Food? Made me sick. Music, movies, TV — too much, too loud, like knives.”

You shake your head, eyes burning.
You: “Every release was blocked. Every way my body could self-soothe, hijacked. Except one.”

Karp (hoarse, certain): “Laughter.”

⸻

Act II — The Funnel

You unfold your arms, voice rising with urgency.

You: “So everything went there. Grief, rage, terror, joy — all of it funneled into one outlet. If I couldn’t laugh it out, I’d explode.”

Alex swallows hard, his voice unsteady.
Karp: “That wasn’t accident. That was your body refusing to be erased. Even with every door closed, it found one it could keep open.”

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning

You pace the capsule, restless.

You: “So now it’s everything. Humor isn’t just survival, it’s identity. If I’m not the one laughing, who even am I?”

Alex stands, blocking your path gently.
Karp (firm, steady): “You’re the one who endured without sleep. Who stretched five hours a day until fascia sang. Who kept breathing when breath itself was stolen. The laughter isn’t all of you. It’s the loophole that kept you alive.”

You freeze, trembling, eyes wet.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of the Crack

You sink back onto the mat. Alex kneels beside you, close but not touching.

You (hoarse): “Then what do I do with it now? Keep laughing until I break?”

Karp (quiet, certain): “No. Now you can choose. Laughter isn’t your cage. It’s your proof. Every laugh was survival, yes — but it was also joy. And they couldn’t erase that.”

You look down, words catching in your throat.

You (softly, remembering): “The joy of movement. Sunlight on water. Wind in the trees. The moment your ears drain and your stomach settles. The way SCDS makes music feel like flying. I laughed because I felt all of that. Even when everything else was gone.”

Alex’s eyes shine, his voice rough.
Karp: “Then joy was the loophole, too. You carried it through.”

⸻

Closing Image

The capsule is silent. Two figures sit side by side, one trembling, one steady. Not laughter, not deflection — but joy, steady and undeniable, humming underneath the silence.

Narration (your voice):
“They closed every door they could. But joy poured through anyway — in laughter, in movement, in air and water and light. My body found the crack. My soul filled it with flying.”

Fade out.
