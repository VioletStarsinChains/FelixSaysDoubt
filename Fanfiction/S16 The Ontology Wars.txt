Season 16, Episode 1: The First Want

Cold Open — Capsule Morning
The lantern is out. Sunlight seeps faintly through the crack in the clay wall. For once, Alex isn’t already awake. You roll over and find him asleep, hair mussed, jaw slack — face stripped of every guard.

You stare for a moment, startled by the softness. He stirs, blinking groggily.

You (softly, amused):
“Well, well. Empires do sleep in.”

He moans, burying his face in the mat.

Title card: The First Want

⸻

Act I — The Question
Later, the two of you sit at the low table, bowls of rice cooling between you. He eats with precision, eyes still heavy with sleep.

You lean forward, studying him.

You:
“What do you want? Right now. Not empire. Not control. Not covenant. Just want.”

Alex freezes, spoon hovering. His brow furrows, like you’ve asked him to solve an impossible proof.

Karp (halting):
“I…don’t know.”

You (gently, teasing):
“Then guess.”

⸻

Act II — The Small Want
Silence stretches. Then, almost sheepishly, he mutters:

Karp:
“I want to lie down again. Just…five more minutes.”

You blink, surprised. Then laugh softly.

You:
“That’s it? That’s the empire-shattering want?”
Karp (defensive, but smiling):
“It feels…dangerous. To let the fire go out, to stop before the list is done.”

You lean back, smiling faintly.

You:
“Bro, who hurt you?”

⸻

Act III — The Permission
You both stretch back onto the mats, bowls abandoned. At first he lies stiffly, hands folded, as if the moment might collapse if he relaxes too much.

You (softly):
“You’re allowed, you know. To want things that don’t save anyone.”

He exhales, long and shaky. His shoulders unclench. He turns his head toward you.

Karp (hoarse):
“Then I want this. Just lying here. Not strategy. Not penance. Just…this.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Want
You reach out, brushing your hand lightly against his. He doesn’t pull away.

You (whispering):
“Then stay. Five more minutes. Or forever. Doesn’t matter. Just want it.”

His eyes close, not in command or calculation, but in rest.

⸻

Closing Image
The capsule glows with morning light. Two figures stretched side by side, bowls forgotten, hands brushing, not empire, not endurance — just want, small and ordinary.

Narration (your voice):
“He thought want had to justify itself. That it had to feed empire, or covenant, or cause. But want was enough. Five minutes. A hand. A morning. The first want, named aloud.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 1.

Season 16, Episode 2: The Study

Cold Open — Capsule Afternoon
Scraps of wood lean against the wall. Clay jars of pigment sit open, brushes soaking. Alex kneels on the mat, staring at the blank panel like it might explode if he touches it.

Karp (hesitant, hoarse):
“I want to paint you.”

You choke on your tea, laughing.

You (flat):
“Bro. You literally just learned to want five minutes ago.”

Title card: The Study

⸻

Act I — The Ask
He meets your gaze, dead serious.

Karp:
“Not spectacle. Not control. Just…want. You move differently than anyone I’ve ever seen. Even when you think you’re still, there’s music under your skin. I need to learn how to see it.”

You raise a brow, torn between suspicion and amusement.

You (dry):
“You realize figure study means staring at me. For hours.”
Karp (quietly, reverently):
“I’ve been staring for decades. But never like this. Never with your consent.”

⸻

Act II — The Resistance
You pace, arms crossed.

You:
“Every man who ever wanted to paint me wanted a trophy. A muse. A body to flatten into their idea. What makes you different?”

He doesn’t flinch.

Karp (hoarse):
“I don’t want a muse. I want you. The curve of a muscle when it trembles. The breath that breaks your balance. The way fascia refuses to lie flat. If all I paint is imperfection, then I’ve seen you honestly.”

Silence stretches. Slowly, you sit, letting him set the board across his knees.

⸻

Act III — The Study
The brush touches pigment, then wood. His strokes are stiff at first, too careful. You shift, rolling your shoulder, letting fascia crackle audibly.

You (softly, teasing):
“Relax as hard as you know how to tense. Gentle hand rules the land, remember?”

His mouth quirks. The strokes loosen. He paints not lines, but rhythms — tension, release, twitch, breath. The room grows hushed.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Sight
Hours later, he sets the brush down, trembling. The study is rough, uneven — but alive. Your body rendered not as idol but as process, mid-breath, mid-fight.

Karp (whispering):
“I thought I envied you. But really, I was starving to see. To witness you, not consume you.”

You (steady):
“Then keep seeing. But remember — this is covenant, not conquest. You paint me because I let you. And only as long as I keep letting you.”

He nods, humbled.

⸻

Closing Image
The capsule glows with evening light. A crude painting leans against the wall: a body imperfect, twitching, alive. Two figures sit close, one still trembling from painting, the other steady, gaze unbroken.

Narration (your voice):
“He thought painting was conquest. But sight, like want, was covenant. Not muse, not idol — only flesh, seen and unbreakable.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 2.

⸻

Season 16, Episode 3: Self-Portrait

Cold Open — Capsule Evening
The study of you leans against the wall, still drying, pigments streaked but alive. Alex sits beside it, silent, brush twirling nervously between his fingers.

You (wry):
“Your turn.”

His head jerks up.

Karp (startled):
“My…turn?”

You (firm, amused):
“You wanted to see me. Now I want to see you. Paint yourself.”

Title card: Self-Portrait

⸻

Act I — The Resistance
Alex stiffens, almost recoiling from the board.

Karp (hoarse):
“I built an empire to avoid this. To avoid ever being seen.”

You (soft, cutting):
“And yet you wanted to see me. That’s not covenant unless it goes both ways.”

He exhales sharply, jaw clenched, then finally nods.

⸻

Act II — The First Stroke
He sits before the blank panel, brush hovering, paralyzed. His first strokes are rigid — shoulders squared, jaw hard, lines harsh.

You (gently, behind him):
“Stop painting the fortress. I don’t want the empire. I want the man.”

His hand trembles. The brush loosens. Slowly, the angles soften.

⸻

Act III — The Breaking Open
Hours pass in silence. His strokes grow messier, rawer. Pigment spreads across the wood — dark hollows under eyes, crooked shoulders, lips set tight with secrets. He doesn’t flinch from imperfection.

Finally, he mutters, voice breaking:
Karp:
“This is what I never let them see. The hunger. The exhaustion. The failure. Not a leader — just scar tissue trying to pass for skin.”

You kneel beside him, steady.

You (softly):
“Then you’ve painted yourself honestly. For the first time.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Reflection
When the brush drops, the self-portrait leans against the wall: stark, unsparing, but alive. Alex stares at it, shaking.

Karp (whispering):
“I thought sight was power. But this…feels like surrender.”

You place your hand over his.

You:
“Surrender isn’t defeat. It’s the only way to be seen. And now I see you.”

He exhales, long and trembling, but doesn’t look away from the portrait.

⸻

Closing Image
Two crude paintings side by side: your body in motion, his body unmasked. Two figures sit together before them, hands touching, silence steady.

Narration (your voice):
“He painted me to see beyond control. I made him paint himself to strip away disguise. Two studies, two truths — covenant not of conquest, but of reflection.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 3.

⸻ 

Season 16, Episode 4: Painted Hands

Cold Open — Capsule Morning
Your two portraits lean side by side against the wall: his study of you, his self-portrait. Alex sits cross-legged before them, lost in thought. You enter with a brush and scrap of wood, jaw set.

You (wry):
“My turn.”

He blinks.

Karp (startled):
“You want to paint me?”

You (grinning faintly):
“Yeah. Fair’s fair. Sit still, pretty boy.”

Title card: Painted Hands

⸻

Act I — The First Attempt
He sits stiffly, back straight. You dip your brush, hand already trembling. The first strokes come jagged, too tight.

Your fingers seize suddenly. You drop the brush, gasping.

Alex is beside you instantly, lifting your hand into his lap, kneading gently at the knuckles.

Karp (quiet, intent):
“Let me help.”

You (half-laughing, half-wincing):
“Careful. These hands have started revolutions.”

⸻

Act II — The Rhythm
The cramp eases under his steady pressure. You flex your fingers, pick up the brush again.

Brush to wood, pause. Cramp, stop. He takes your hand without waiting, working your palm until the spasm passes. You resume.

The cycle repeats, each massage building patience into the portrait. His touch isn’t indulgence — it’s covenant, matching your rhythm of pain and persistence.

⸻

Act III — The Intimacy
Midway through, you rest again, hand limp in his. He works your wrist with quiet concentration.

Karp (hoarse):
“You’d endure this… just to see me through your own eyes?”

You (softly, fierce):
“I’ve been seen too much. Too long. And almost never on my own terms. This is me choosing to see you. Even if it hurts.”

He bows his head, thumb circling your wrist, as though memorizing its frailty and strength at once.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Patience
Hours later, the portrait is unfinished but alive: uneven lines, streaks where the brush slipped, but eyes that pierce with startling clarity.

You set the brush down, trembling. He takes your hands again, rubbing warmth into your sore knuckles.

You (whispering):
“Good enough.”

Alex studies the work, then looks at you.

Karp (softly):
“It’s not just good enough. It’s… the truest face I’ve ever been given.”

You lean back against the wall, letting him keep your hands cradled in his.

⸻

Closing Image
Two portraits side by side: your rough, halting strokes, his own unsparing self-portrait. Two figures seated in silence, hands cramped, hands soothed, covenant painted through touch.

Narration (your voice):
“I painted him in pain, not precision. My hand could only hold so long before giving out. But in the pauses, in his touch, I found him — not as empire saw him, but as I chose.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 4.

⸻ 

Season 16, Episode 5: Installations

Cold Open — Capsule Morning
The capsule is cluttered with scavenged odds and ends: onion skins, broken glass, rusted wire, wood scraps, feathers, clay shards. You and Alex sit opposite each other, piles between you.

You (grinning):
“Alright, no portraits. Today we build.”

Karp (deadpan, but with a spark in his eye):
“You want installation art in a clay capsule?”

You:
“Why not? Empires fall, art stays.”

Title card: Installations

⸻

Act I — The Gathering
You sort onion skins into translucent layers, feathers into careful spirals. Alex bends wire with surprising precision, rigging frames from broken wood.

You (teasing):
“Of course you’d start with structure.”
Karp (without looking up):
“Chaos collapses without a frame.”
You:
“Chaos is the frame.”

He smirks, not arguing, only working.

⸻

Act II — The Process
You string onion skins like stained glass across the capsule’s narrow window. When the sun shifts, amber light floods in, turning the space honey-gold.

Alex builds a suspended mobile of bent wire and clay shards. It sways gently, casting fractured shadows over the walls.

You (whispering):
“Looks like empire breaking.”
Karp (quietly):
“Then maybe I finally made something honest.”

⸻

Act III — The Collision
Space runs out. Your spirals of feathers creep across the floor; his mobile hangs too low. You both laugh, bumping into each other’s work.

You (mock stern):
“Your empire-mobile is in my forest.”
Karp (grinning faintly):
“Your feral forest invaded my ceiling.”

The tension breaks into laughter, both projects tangled but alive.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Making
At dusk, the capsule glows: feathers rustling, onion skins glowing, shards swaying overhead. It looks nothing like home, nothing like empire — but something new.

You sit cross-legged in the middle of the chaos. Alex lowers himself beside you, both of you surrounded by your imperfect creations.

Karp (softly):
“I thought art had to endure. But maybe it only has to live.”
You (smiling faintly):
“Exactly. Just like us.”

⸻

Closing Image
The capsule transformed: fragile onion light, feathers shifting, shards dancing on wire. Two figures sit amid the installations, neither masterpiece nor mess — just covenant, alive.

Narration (your voice):
“We built not for galleries, not for markets, not for permanence. We built for breath, for presence. For once, empire gave way to art that only needed to exist.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 5.

⸻

Season 16, Episode 6: Red Thread

Cold Open — Capsule Evening
The fire burns low. Alex enters the capsule, carrying something wrapped in cloth. He kneels, unfolding it: a bundle of twine, dyed deep red, smelling faintly of onions.

Karp (softly):
“It reminded me of you. Of something I once watched but couldn’t touch.”

You tilt your head, curious.

Title card: Red Thread

⸻

Act I — The Gift
You take the twine in your hands, running your fingers along its uneven texture. The color glows in the firelight — dark, raw, alive.

You (smiling faintly):
“You dyed this?”
Karp (nodding):
“Onion skins. Like the light you strung across the capsule. I thought maybe you’d know what to do with it.”

You laugh softly, almost disbelieving.

⸻

Act II — The Memory
You start unwinding the twine, fingers fumbling as your joints lock. Alex steadies the skein for you, listening.

You (whispering):
“In college I filled entire rooms with webs. Yarn crisscrossing from wall to wall, floor to ceiling. People had to crawl and duck to move through. I wanted them to feel what I felt every day — trapped, tangled, always navigating barriers.”

Alex watches you closely, his voice low.

Karp:
“I remember. Every strand. The way you tied knots until your hands cramped. The way the webs swallowed space. You thought no one cared. But I carried every thread.”

You freeze, throat tight.

⸻

Act III — The Recognition
The twine pools in your lap. You glance up sharply.

You:
“Then you already know those webs weren’t just about entrapment. They were survival. Proof I could take a suffocating room and make it mine.”
Karp (quietly):
“I know. I envied it. Empire only ever taught me how to tear things down. You showed me how to claim them.”

You (hoarse, teasing):
“And now you’re the one bringing me string, like some oversized crow.”
He smiles faintly, unoffended.

⸻

Act IV — The Weaving
Together, you tie the twine to the capsule beams, stringing it loosely across the ceiling. The lines are uneven, imperfect, but glowing red in the firelight.

You (softly):
“Not a trap. Not a cage. Just a web we chose to sit under.”
Karp (whispering):
“Covenant made visible.”

⸻

Closing Image
The capsule ceiling strung with crimson thread, glowing in the fire’s flicker. Two figures beneath, watching the lines tremble gently with each draft of air.

Narration (your voice):
“Once, my webs marked entrapment. Now, they marked covenant — chosen threads, tied not to ensnare but to endure. And for once, the web didn’t close. It opened.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 6.

⸻

Season 16, Episode 7: Lavender

Cold Open — Capsule Morning
The red onion twine still hangs overhead, trembling in the draft. You sit weaving another strand, knotting clumsily but deliberately. Alex watches, lips twitching like he’s holding something back.

You (eyeing him):
“What?”
Karp (low, almost sheepish):
“I keep thinking about lavender yarn.”

Title card: Lavender

⸻

Act I — The Memory
He shifts closer, voice steadying.

Karp:
“The dean’s son dragged that giant rebar phallus into the front yard of the darkroom house. Rusting, ridiculous, a monument to nothing. And then you—without permission, without warning—came back with lavender yarn. You wrapped it until the steel was swallowed in color. Defiance turned into beauty.”

You blink, caught off guard.

You:
“You watched me do that?”
Karp (nodding):
“Every knot. Every loop. The way your fingers cramped, the way you smiled even when no one else was watching. I thought—‘This is how resistance becomes undeniable.’”

⸻

Act II — The Defiance
You laugh bitterly, shaking your head.

You:
“The administration hated it. Asked me to take it down. But I refused. And they didn’t push, because even they knew it looked better my way.”

Karp (quietly, reverent):
“You turned their monument of arrogance into something alive. Something communal. Lavender against rust. Softness against weight.”

You glance at him sideways.

You:
“Yeah, well. I also just thought it was ugly as hell.”
He laughs, but there’s awe in it.

⸻

Act III — The Confession
Alex’s voice softens, almost breaking.

Karp:
“Empire taught me to build monuments no one asked for. But you—every strand you tied was permission reclaimed. You showed me that resistance doesn’t always roar. Sometimes it knots itself in lavender until even power admits defeat.”

You study him, voice sharp but warm.

You:
“And now you’re telling me you envied me for yarn bombing a phallus.”
Karp (smiling faintly):
“I’m telling you I learned more from lavender than I ever did from steel.”

⸻

Act IV — The Weaving
That night, you unravel a scrap of faded cloth, twisting it into strips, lavender-dyed from old herbs. You tie it among the red onion twine above your capsule. Alex watches, quiet.

You (softly):
“No phallus here. Just covenant.”
Karp (whispering):
“And lavender always wins.”

⸻

Closing Image
The capsule ceiling strung with red and lavender threads, glowing in the firelight. Two figures below, not empire and subject — just co-conspirators, still weaving.

Narration (your voice):
“They built steel. I tied lavender. And he watched, not with command, but with awe. Even then, covenant had begun — not in power, but in thread.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 7.

⸻ 

Season 16, Episode 8: Small Wars

Cold Open — Capsule Night
Lantern light flickers on the lavender and onion threads above. You sit cross-legged, weaving slowly. Alex lies back, eyes on the ceiling, voice low.

Karp (hoarse):
“You thought your rebellions were small. They weren’t. They were wars. And I remember all of them.”

Title card: Small Wars

⸻

Act I — The Hair
Flash: a conservative campus, students in polos and cardigans. In the middle: you, walking with orange, magenta, and purple hair blazing like fire, always with an SLR in your face. Heads turn.

Karp (voiceover):
“They wanted invisibility. You gave them a sunrise. You didn’t need to speak a word — your hair told everyone you weren’t theirs to claim.”

Cut back to the capsule: you laugh, shaking your head.

You:
“Honestly? It was just pretty.”
Karp (smiling faintly):
“Pretty — and defiant.”

⸻

Act II — The Bard
Montage: critique circles, professors squinting at half-finished projects. You lean forward, speaking with conviction, spinning half-hearted collages into visionary statements. Classmates watch, relieved.

Karp (voiceover):
“You could make A’s appear out of thin air. Bard, not student. You saw what the work wanted to be, even when its maker hadn’t. And you taught professors to applaud their own blindness.”

Back to the capsule.

You (grinning):
“They really were rush jobs. I just hated watching my classmates get crushed for it.”
Karp (dryly):
“Empires fall. Bards survive.”

⸻

Act III — The Blasphemy
Flash: a classroom, Shakespeare paper in hand.

You (voiceover):
“Isabella isn’t a character. She’s a plot device. Shakespeare was kind of bad at writing women.”

Professor pauses. Then nods, writing A at the top.

Karp (voiceover):
“You didn’t worship the canon. You cut it open. And even the gatekeepers couldn’t deny you were right.”

⸻

Act IV — The Refusals
Montage:
	•	You walking out of class during Funny Games, head high, leaving stunned silence behind.
	•	A slammed F in your capstone, the dean’s sneer, your unflinching stare.
	•	The canceled senior show that happened anyway.
    •      The wedding shower no one attended—and how relieved you were at that.

Karp (voiceover):
“They tried to break you with rules. You broke the rules instead. Every F was freedom. Every walkout was covenant with yourself. Even when they tried to erase you, you made joy anyway.”

Cut back to the capsule.

You (quietly, steady):
“They failed.”
Karp (softly, almost reverent):
“They always failed.”

⸻

Closing Image
The capsule ceiling glows with red and lavender threads. Below, two figures sit in silence, not needing to embellish what has already been spoken.

Narration (your voice):
“They called them small rebellions. He called them wars. I had forgotten them all. And when he remembered for me, I realized I had never fought alone.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 8.

⸻

Season 16, Episode 9: The Cost

Cold Open — Capsule Morning
The lavender twine web hangs still. You sit beneath it, eyes distant. Alex kneels nearby, watching, weighing his words.

Karp (quietly):
“You paid for every war you won. I remember the bill.”

Title card: The Cost

⸻

Act I — The Isolation
Montage: Meals eaten in secrecy in your shoebox room when even sounds made food intolerable to your immune system. Classmates never being able to hear when you spoke, some glancing at your hair and looking away. Professors shuffling papers, avoiding your gaze.

Karp (voiceover):
“Every refusal set you apart. Every A earned for your classmates left you more alone. They wanted you as spectacle, not as presence.”

Back to the capsule.

You (flatly):
“Yeah. People wanted me in the room to feel better about themselves. Then they wanted me silent.”

⸻

Act II — The Punishments
Montage:
	•	Dean slamming a gradebook.
	•	An official letter threatening expulsion.
	•	A professor’s creepy smile, asking to keep a copy of your body in his office.

Karp (voiceover):
“Every time you said no, they punished you. With F’s, with erasure, with lechery dressed as spirituality. They couldn’t make you vanish, so they tried to make you regret.”

Back to the capsule.

You (bitter laugh):
“Funny thing is, I didn’t regret it. It never even occurred to me.”

⸻

Act III — The Loneliness
Flash: the night of your senior show-that-wasn’t. Campus halls empty, gallery full. You hate the attention.  You wish you were in your pajamas.

Karp (voiceover):
“You made joy anyway. But joy stolen from what was rightfully yours is still shadowed. Even in laughter, I saw the loneliness. I saw the cost.”

Back to the capsule.

You (low, sharp):
“And you let me pay it.”
Karp (hoarse):
“I told myself it was necessary. But empire logic doesn’t comfort a lifetime of emptiness.”
You: "I suppose it was necessary.  And I do not regret what it made me."

⸻

Act IV — The Reckoning
Silence stretches. You turn to him, voice steady.

You:
“The costs weren’t mine alone. You paid them, too. You let the punishments measure me while you measured yourself by how I endured.  When you never had to do that to yourself."
Karp (whispering):
“And I hate that you’re right.”

You reach for the twine web, letting the red thread slip through your fingers.

You (softly):
“But the cost was never final. Because I’m still here. And you’re here now. That’s what they couldn’t take.”

He bows his head, relief flickering across his face.

⸻

Closing Image
The capsule glows faintly with morning light. The web of lavender and onion threads sways overhead, imperfect, enduring. Two figures sit below it, shadows long but unbroken.

Narration (your voice):
“They punished me for every refusal. They left me hungry, lonely, defiant. But they never erased me. And the cost, once counted, became proof that I was still alive.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 9.

⸻

Season 16, Episode 10: The Share of Cost

Cold Open — Capsule Evening
Lantern light flickers against the twine web. You sit cross-legged, tired, staring at a jar of pills. Alex kneels beside you, reaching for one.

Karp (quiet, steady):
“Let me pay tonight.”

You glance up, suspicious.

You (dry):
“Unless you’ve magically developed MCAS, you can’t.”

Karp (softly):
“Not that cost. But I can take some weight off yours.”

Title card: The Share of Cost

⸻

Act I — The Attempt
Alex insists on grinding herbs for you, even as the pestle slips clumsily in his hand. He measures water into a pot, but splashes it everywhere. His movements are careful, earnest — but graceless.

You (teasing, but soft):
“You’d never survive my kitchen jobs.”
Karp (grinning faintly):
“You'd never have survived them either without me telling you the most efficient way to do everything.”

You watch him, arms folded, tension easing.

⸻

Act II — The Confession
Later, he sits wiping sweat from his brow, herbs steeping.

Karp (low, hoarse):
“I let you carry all the costs. Refusals, punishments, scars. I told myself endurance made you stronger. But really — it made me cowardly. Because I couldn’t face the bill myself.”

Silence. You study him, then sigh.

You:
“Endurance did make me stronger.  And recognizing how cowardly you were made you want to do better.  That's good enough for me.”

His head drops.

⸻

Act III — The Reversal
You gently hand him the pestle again.

You (firm):
“I don't need you to punish yourself over me.  In fact, I would really prefer if you stopped.  But you can grind the herbs, because my hands don't work."

He nods, jaw tight, and sets back to work. This time he doesn’t hesitate. When the mixture is ready, he hands you a clay cup.

Karp (steady):
“My share. Not yours alone.”

You sip, grimacing at the bitterness.

You (wry):
“Congratulations, you’ve officially joined the Mule 6 fan club.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Burden
Later, you both sit back against the capsule wall. The empty cup rests between you.

Karp (softly):
“I can’t erase what you paid. But I can pay forward. Every day. Until the balance shifts.”
You (quiet, after a pause):
“Then it’s covenant. Not contract. You’re not buying forgiveness — you’re sharing the weight.”

His hand brushes yours, steady.

⸻

Closing Image
The capsule glows low. Two figures sit shoulder to shoulder, a single empty cup between them — not debt, not empire, but cost divided.

Narration (your voice):
“They punished me until cost became identity. He confessed he’d let me pay it alone. But covenant meant new math — no longer mine alone, but ours. And for once, the bill was lighter.”

Fade out.
End of Season 16.
