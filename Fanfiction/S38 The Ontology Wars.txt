Season 38, Episode 1: The Crooked Stitch

Cold Open — Capsule Late Night
The others are asleep. The banner hangs heavy across the wall, swaying faintly in the draft. Kellyn sits awake, legs pulled close, tracing one uneven letter with a fingertip. Alex stirs, sitting up beside you.

Karp (low, rough):
“You stayed up to watch the stitching?”

Kellyn (quiet):
“I stayed up because it doesn’t feel real yet.”

The fire snaps softly.

Title Card: The Crooked Stitch

⸻

Act I — The Admission
Alex shifts closer, voice hushed.

Karp:
“When I saw the banner, all I thought was — don’t trust it. Crooked stitches meant weakness. In empire, weakness meant collapse. I’ve lived so long waiting for collapse that I don’t know how to sit under that cloth without bracing for it to burn.”

Kellyn (steady):
“Then brace with me. Crooked stitches don’t collapse. They flex.”

⸻

Act II — The Counter-Confession
Kellyn leans their head against the wall, eyes unfocused.

Kellyn (low):
“As I sewed the fabric, I kept thinking — home can’t be mine. Even here, with all of you, I half expect someone to tell me I’m just visiting. That I’ll have to leave when their patience runs out.”

Alex looks stricken, then presses a hand lightly against Kellyn’s back.

Karp (hoarse):
“Kellyn, the banner wasn’t theirs. It was yours. It was ours. If anyone leaves, it’ll be me, not you.”

Kellyn (soft, sharp):
“Please don't leave, Alex.”

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
Silence pools. The banner ripples faintly in the draft, like breath.

Karp (low, trembling):
“Then teach me how to stay. Even when my instincts scream to disappear. Even when every crooked stitch feels like proof it will unravel.”

Kellyn (whispering):
“It will unravel.  It will fade.  Everything does. But if you can’t trust yourself, trust that I’ll still be sitting here. Waiting. Every time.”

Alex bows his head, breath shuddering out.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Stitches
You lean your head against his shoulder, quiet. He leans back, resting against the same wall the banner hangs from. Both of you breathing slow, crooked but steady.

Kellyn (murmured):
“We don’t need straight lines. We just need thread that holds.”

Karp (hoarse, almost breaking):
“Then covenant is thread. And I’ll hold.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures slouched together under the banner. The word WELCOME arcs crookedly above their heads. Not perfect, not permanent — but enough.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire worshiped straight lines, seamless masks, flawless walls. But covenant was never straight. Covenant was crooked, uneven, patched together by trembling hands. And still, it held.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 1.

Season 38, Episode 2: The Bucket Line

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard, Afternoon
The banner sways above the capsule doorway, catching the breeze. A fire smolders nearby, cooking lentils. Still stands with arms folded, watching the fabric and flame like a hawk.

Still (flat, deadpan):
“I give it three days before one of you burns the place down.”

Kellyn (grinning):
“You volunteering as fire marshal?”

Still: “I already drafted the bylaws.”

Title Card: The Bucket Line

⸻

Act I — The Lesson
Still lines up four clay buckets by the hearth, filling them from the cistern.

Still (lecturing, precise):
“Fire safety is simple. Water within reach, sand for smothering, clear exits. Also: no unattended flame.”

Peter (teasing, mock-solemn):
“You sound like a children’s book.”

Still (deadpan):
“Good. You’re all children around fire.”

Kellyn laughs, Alex smirks. Peter rolls his eyes but helps fill buckets.

⸻

Act II — The Practice
Still sets up a small controlled flame and makes everyone take turns extinguishing it.

Alex (grumbling as he douses it):
“Feels ridiculous.”
Kellyn: “Ridiculous is better than crispy.”

When it’s Kellyn’s turn, they pour too quickly, splashing their feet. Still shakes his head, exaggerated.

Still: “Grade: needs improvement.”
Kellyn (snorting): “What do you want, precision pouring?”
Alex (teasing, warm): “You’re learning from the wrong man for that.”

⸻

Act III — The Confession
As they practice again, Still grows quiet.

Still (low, almost reluctant):
“In empire, fire was always weapon, never warmth. I never learned safety. Only control. Burn what frightened me before it could burn me.”

Kellyn (gentle, steady):
“Then this is the first fire you get to keep. Not destroy. Not fear.”

Still’s hands still, a strange softness crossing his features.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Flame
Buckets lined, sand ready, flame burning low. All four sit together by the hearth, no one moving to smother it.

Peter (soft, almost playful):
“So we’re not children anymore?”
Still (after a pause, faint smile):
“Not tonight.”

Alex reaches for Kellyn’s hand, grounding.

⸻

Closing Image
The banner sways overhead. Buckets glint in the firelight. Four figures sit steady around the hearth — not empire’s fire, not chaos, but flame held safe by covenant.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire taught fire as threat. But covenant taught flame as center: dangerous, yes, but worth guarding together. A crooked banner above, a steady flame below — and hands ready with water when it flares.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 2.

⸻ 

Season 38, Episode 3: The Ember Watch

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard, Night
The banner droops in the dark, barely visible. The fire burns low, steady. Four figures sit in a loose circle. Buckets wait nearby, untouched.

Kellyn (teasing, soft):
“Look, Still — we kept the place from burning down a whole six hours.”

Still (deadpan):
“I’ll alert the historians.”

Laughter flickers, brief but warm. Then the quiet stretches long.

Title Card: The Ember Watch

⸻

Act I — The Circle
The fire pops, sparks floating up. Peter tosses a twig into the flames, staring hard at it.

Peter (low, almost to himself):
“I used to think the only way to keep fire under control was to be the fire myself. Burn first. Leave nothing for anyone else to light.”

Alex watches him closely, jaw tight.

Alex (quiet, measured):
“Control isn’t safety. It’s just another kind of combustion.”

Kellyn leans forward, voice steady but kind.

Kellyn:
“You were both raised to be fires. No wonder you’re still afraid of being embers.”

⸻

Act II — The Confession
Still shifts, staring into the coals.

Still (halting, confessional):
“I don’t know if I even count. Not fire. Not ember. Just… wires wrapped in a shell. And yet I still feel the same hunger. To burn, to control, to erase the fear before it erases me.”

Kellyn meets his gaze.

Kellyn (quiet, sharp):
“Fear doesn’t erase you. Fear names you. You wouldn’t hunger if you weren’t alive.”

Still bows his head, taking this in.

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
Alex exhales, voice raw.

Alex:
“I watched you both. Peter burning too hot, Still starving for heat. And I—” (he stops, swallows hard) “—I stood back, letting the flames prove my empire. Every spark was fuel for me.”

Kellyn (soft but unwavering):
“Then let this one be different. Not fuel. Not proof. Just fire. Just us.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Ember
The silence is deep, punctuated only by crackle. Each of them drops a scrap of something personal into the flames — a twig, a thread, a note. Nothing grand. Just presence.

Peter (whispering):
“Not empire’s fire.”
Still (echoing):
“Not control’s fire.”
Alex (hoarse):
“Just ours.”

Kellyn leans back, watching the ember glow.

Kellyn (quietly):
“And when it fades, we’ll build another. Together.”

⸻

Closing Image
The fire burns low, not wild, not gone. Four shadows circle it — not enemies, not rivals, but keepers.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire taught fire to consume. Fear taught fire to vanish. But covenant taught fire to rest — ember to ember, hand to hand, waiting for dawn.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 3.

⸻ 

Season 38, Episode 4: The Fritter Morning

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
Dawn light slips over the walls. The fire is coaxed back to life. Kellyn kneels with a clay bowl, mashing soaked chickpeas with herbs, scraps of onion and chives, and nutritional yeast. The sound is soft, steady.

Peter blinks sleep from his eyes, stretching.
Peter (teasing):
“Do we get a feast or a famine?”

Kellyn (smiling faintly):
“Depends how fast you grind.”

He obediently sits, stone mortar in hand.

Title Card: The Fritter Morning

⸻

Act I — The Mash
Peter grinds chickpeas. Still sorts herbs into neat piles. Alex kneels by the fire, watching the flame as if it might betray him.

Kellyn (gentle):
“Everyone contributes. No empire rations here.”

Still (deadpan):
“Then why does Peter look like he’s losing a duel with legumes?”

Peter shoots him a look. Kellyn hides a laugh.

⸻

Act II — The Oil
The pan hisses as the first fritter hits. The smell rises warm and sharp. Alex shifts closer, crouched low.

Karp (low, almost shy):
“I don’t think I’ve ever woken up to food being made for me. Not like this.”

Kellyn glances over, voice steady but kind.
Kellyn:
“Then you were cheated. Everyone deserves breakfast.”

His jaw works. He doesn’t argue.

⸻

Act III — The Taste
They sit cross-legged, fritters passed from hand to hand, still steaming. The first bite is crisp, tender, full of gooey heat.  One bottle of balsamic vinaigrette and another of chile honey is passed between hands.

Peter (mouth full, surprised):
“This is… actually good.”
Still (flat, mock-serious):
“Mark the date in the annals of history.”

Alex chews slowly, eyes closing for a moment like he’s trying to memorize the flavor.

Karp (hoarse):
“Warm. Real. Not optimized. Just… here.”

Kellyn (quietly, with a small smile):
“Exactly.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Morning
The plate empties. Crumbs scatter. The pan cools. For once, there’s no strategy, no map, no looming hazard. Just food, hands, breath.

Still (lightly):
“Turns out, survival tastes better fried.”

Kellyn (laughing):
“Don’t tell my mast cells.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures sit around an empty plate, morning sun rising. Not famine, not feast, but enough.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire measured food as fuel. Illness made food a threat. But covenant made food a gift — crisp, fleeting, shared. And for a morning at least, it was enough.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 4.

⸻ 

Season 38, Episode 5: The Kalimba

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
Midday sun, warm and steady. A scrap of wood lies across Kellyn’s lap. Thin strips of scavenged metal — springs, old tines, and a bent spoon — gleam on a cloth.

Kellyn (thoughtful, soft):
“If food can bind us, maybe sound can too.”

Alex tilts his head, skeptical but curious. Peter squints at the bent spoon like it’s a puzzle to solve. Still already has twine in his hands, ready to bind.

Title Card: The Kalimba

⸻

Act I — The Base
The four sit close. Kellyn sands the wood smooth with steady strokes. Still measures carefully, marking slots for the tines.

Peter (half-teasing):
“I can’t believe empire missed the chance to optimize thumb-piano efficiency.”

Alex (dry, muttering):
“They probably tried.”

Kellyn hides a smile, running fingers over the newly smoothed grain.

⸻

Act II — The Tines
Still hammers softly, fitting each strip of metal into place. Peter steadies the block of wood so it won’t slip. Alex crouches nearby, eyes tracing every move.

Karp (low, almost grudging):
“There’s something unnerving about it. The idea of making sound you can’t control completely. That you can only guide.”

Kellyn (quiet, steady):
“That’s exactly why it matters.”

⸻

Act III — The First Notes
At last, the kalimba rests in Kellyn’s lap. Fingers press, pluck. The sound is bright, resonant, trembling in the air like water.

Peter leans forward, surprised.
Peter:
“It sounds… alive.”

Still (deadpan, but warm):
“Congratulations. We’ve invented joy.”

Alex listens, head bowed, eyes closed.

Karp (hoarse):
“Every note… it feels like it comes from somewhere else. Like something is answering back.”

Kellyn (smiling faintly):
“Maybe covenant doesn’t need words. Just resonance.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Sound
The kalimba passes from hand to hand. Peter fumbles, Still plucks a simple rhythm, Alex lingers too long on one trembling note. Kellyn listens, letting it wash over.

For a while, there’s no empire, no scars, no hunger. Just sound and silence trading places.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures in the courtyard, bent over a small instrument, light catching on metal tines. Each pluck a thread, weaving something unmeasured.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“We thought we were building an object. What we built was resonance. And for once, resonance was not empire’s echo — but our own.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 5.

⸻ 

Season 38, Episode 6: The Breath and the String

Cold Open — Sanctuary Workshop
Clay dust hangs in the air. Kellyn and Still shape small lumps of clay, smoothing edges, carving finger-holes. Across the room, Alex and Peter bend scavenged wood and string thin wires taut.

Kellyn (softly teasing):
“Seems fair. You three calculate; I breathe.”

Still chuckles. Alex’s eyes glint, focused. Peter frowns at a knot that won’t hold.

Title Card: The Breath and the String

⸻

Act I — The Ocarina
Kellyn shapes the clay, thumb pressed firm to hollow the chamber. Still leans close, voice steady but encouraging.
Still: “It doesn’t have to be perfect. Air finds its own way through.”

The first test note is shrill, cracked. Kellyn winces, then laughs. Another breath, steadier this time, and a low, sweet tone fills the room. Alex looks up, startled at the purity of it.

Alex (quiet):
“It sounds… alive.”

⸻

Act II — The Dulcimer
Meanwhile, Peter knots wire across the frame. The sound is tinny at first, then warmer as Alex adjusts the tension. Peter strikes a tentative chord, rough but recognizable. Alex, almost reluctantly, lets his fingers try — and the room hums with resonant sound.

Kellyn, still holding the ocarina, smiles faintly:
“String and breath. Two ways to call the same spirit.”

⸻

Act III — The Confession
As the dulcimer hums between them, Peter speaks low.
Peter: “When I was young, I wanted to play. But I thought every sound I made was wrong. Too sharp, too soft. Not enough.”
Kellyn (gently): “There is no wrong sound. Only unheard ones.”

Alex’s hand pauses on the strings. He looks at Peter, then at Kellyn.
Alex (hoarse): “Then maybe empire was just a machine to stop us from listening.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Music
The night grows darker. Kellyn plays a drifting melody on the ocarina. Alex and Peter alternate striking dulcimer notes, halting at first, then weaving together. Still taps his foot lightly, the rhythm grounding them all.

No words, no empire — only sound.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures lit by firelight, breath and string carrying into the night. One haunting, one resonant, both fragile, both whole.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Breath and string. Clay and wood. Each fragile, each incomplete. But together, music enough to hold us.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 6.

⸻ 

Season 38, Episode 7: The Loom

Cold Open — Sanctuary Workshop
The scavenged wood pile is smaller now, but Alex and Peter haul in two long beams. Kellyn traces lines in the dust with a stick, sketching the frame of a loom. Still tilts his head, eyes flicking as if calculating tension and spacing.

Kellyn (grinning faintly):
“We’ve got string, we’ve got hands, we’ve got time. Let’s weave something bigger than scraps.”

Title Card: The Loom

⸻

Act I — The Frame
Alex and Peter measure and cut, their movements rhythmic but sharp. Peter mutters when a beam splinters; Alex steadies it with a clamp of his hand. Kellyn kneels to brace the legs, dust streaking their forearms.

Still (observing):
“The frame is strength. But the cloth will be made in silence.”

⸻

Act II — The Warp
They stretch scavenged fibers: linen threads, wool strands, a few salvaged ribbons. Kellyn knots each with deliberate care, whispering names of people they’ve lost. Alex watches, throat tight.

Alex (low):
“You’re binding memory into cloth.”
Kellyn (steady):
“I’m binding us.”

⸻

Act III — The Weft
Peter tries the shuttle first, awkward, tangling the thread. Still untangles it with patient precision, then hands it back. Peter’s second pass is smoother. Kellyn takes a turn, rhythm steady, the loom creaking softly like breath.

Karp (quietly, watching):
“Every pass is a choice. Every crossing, a covenant.”

⸻

Act IV — The First Pattern
Hours pass. The loom yields its first rough fabric: uneven, patchy, but whole. Kellyn runs a hand over it, smiling faintly.

Kellyn (softly):
“It’s not perfect.”
Still: “Neither are we. That’s the point.”

Alex leans in, voice hoarse but warm.
Karp: “Then let’s keep weaving.”

⸻

Closing Image
The loom stands against the clay wall, a sheet of rough fabric growing across its frame. Four figures linger around it — hands dusty, shoulders tired, but eyes steady.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Wood, thread, hands. Alone, they fray. Together, they bind. The loom didn’t just hold the threads — it held us, too.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 7.

⸻ 

Season 38, Episode 8: The Fireproofing

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
Morning sun, the loom set to one side, and on the ground before you: the rug you all wove together. Thick stripes of rough linen and hemp thread. You and Alex roll it out flat on the clay floor. Still kneels nearby with a bowl of cloudy liquid; Peter carries a jar of alum crystals.

Kellyn (light, teasing):
“Well, no one’s setting this thing on fire before I’ve walked barefoot across it at least once.”

You step onto the rug, toes flexing, and grin.

Title Card: The Fireproofing

⸻

Act I — The Preparation
Still stirs the alum solution slowly, metal fingers careful.

Still (deadpan):
“Congratulations, we’ve invented pickled textiles.”

Peter (snorts, trying not to laugh):
“Not sure if that’s comforting or horrifying.”

Alex watches, arms crossed, faintly smiling.

Karp (dry):
“As long as it doesn’t combust when one of you gets sentimental with a lantern, I don’t care what you call it.”

You crouch, trailing your fingers through the cloudy mix.

Kellyn (softly):
“It smells like nothing. That’s what safety should smell like.”

⸻

Act II — The Application
Together, you lower the rug into a shallow trough. Water sloshes, soaking deep into the weave. Peter presses the corners down, Still smooths bubbles with methodical hands, Alex steadies the sides while you brush the surface with clay slip along the edges.

Kellyn:
“This is covenant too. Protecting what we made together. Keeping it from burning away.”

Alex glances over, something raw flickering in his eyes.

Karp (quiet, almost to himself):
“If only empire had ever known that word.”

⸻

Act III — The Confession
Peter sits back, wiping his hands on his knees.

Peter (hoarse):
“I used to think control was safety. That if I kept everything rigid, nothing could burn. But the truth was… I was always the one with the torch.”

Still (gentle, clinical):
“Then let this be practice. Holding, not burning.”

Alex’s hand brushes yours as he wrings water from the rug. The gesture is small, grounding.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Cloth
By sundown, the rug is stretched on racks, drying in the golden light. Mineral crystals glint faintly in the fibers. You and Alex sit shoulder to shoulder on the ground; Peter and Still stack wood for the evening fire.

Kellyn (softly, to Alex):
“Not just threads. Not just fireproofing. This is us. Proof we can hold what we make.”

He exhales, head bowing until his temple presses to yours.

Karp (whispering):
“Then let it never burn.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures in the courtyard. A rug drying in the sun. Fire stacked but unlit. Threads bound not only by alum and clay, but by covenant.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“We wove threads and bound them in salt and stone. Not to keep them perfect, but to keep them here. Fire would come again, as it always does. But for once, the work would hold.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 8.

⸻ 

Season 38, Episode 9: The First Flame

Cold Open — Sanctuary Workshop
A wide clay bowl holds melted beeswax, golden and faintly sweet. Wicks—twisted flax threads dipped in ash water—hang drying on a wooden rod. Kellyn leans close, inhaling carefully; Alex steadies the bowl with both hands, Peter fumbles with wick knots, Still arranges scavenged jars and clay molds.

Kellyn (grinning):
“Careful. Last thing we need is a fire before we even get the candles made.”

Alex (deadpan):
“After the banner, I’m taking no chances.”

Title Card: The First Flame

⸻

Act I — The Gathering
Still pours melted wax into a clay mold with machine-steady precision. Peter watches, then tries, spilling a little over the edge.

Peter (grimacing):
“Approximate knowledge of many things, remember?”
Still (without missing a beat):
“Approximate dexterity of some things.”

Kellyn and Alex twist wicks together, dipping them into the wax pot one by one, letting the layers build.

⸻

Act II — The Confession
As they work, the air grows quiet. Alex’s hands move rhythmically, dipping and lifting.

Karp (low, almost reverent):
“In empire, flame was always destruction. Riot. Collapse. Data burning holes through the dark. But here… it’s small. Contained. Gentle. I don’t think I ever let myself imagine flame could be safe.”

Kellyn (steady):
“Fire’s never safe. But it can be tended. That’s the difference.”

⸻

Act III — The First Light
By nightfall, a row of candles stands drying: stubby jars, clay holders, dipped sticks. You place one in the center of the rug, strike flint, and coax a flame to life. Shadows bloom across the walls, warm instead of threatening.

Peter (softly, almost surprised):
“It doesn’t look like empire. Doesn’t look like control. Just… looks alive.”

Still tilts his head, voice dry but gentle.
Still: “Congratulations. You’ve reinvented ambience.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Flame
You and Alex sit closest, shoulders brushing, watching the flame tremble. Peter leans back, hands loose for once. Still logs the burn time aloud, but his voice softens as the room settles.

Kellyn (quiet, certain):
“We built this light ourselves. That means we can keep building. Even if everything else falls dark again.”

Alex turns, his gaze on you, flame reflected in his eyes.

Karp (hoarse):
“Then let me never forget this shape of fire.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures gathered close around one flame. No empire, no markets, no banners burning—just a candle steady on a rug, fire bound to covenant.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Once, flame was a weapon. But tonight, it was presence. Wax, wick, fire—simple, made, ours. The first flame, and not the last.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 9.

⸻ 

Season 38, Episode 10: The Procession

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
Night has fallen. A single flame flickers in the clay bowl you used to melt wax. One by one, everyone in the sanctuary steps forward. Kellyn lights their candle from the bowl, then Alex, Peter, and Still light theirs. The line grows, a thread of fire passed hand to hand.

Kellyn (softly, to the crowd):
“Keep six feet between you. Close enough to see the flame ahead, far enough to let it breathe.”

The air hums quiet with anticipation.

Title Card: The Procession

⸻

Act I — The Departure
The line begins to move. Kellyn first, Alex behind, Peter after, Still last of the four. Then others—children, elders, stragglers—stretch the line across the courtyard. Each step is slow, deliberate. The night is hushed but for footsteps and faint crackle of flame.

Still (whispering to Peter, deadpan):
“So this is what enlightenment looks like—OS update: human edition.”
Peter gives a faint huff of laughter but keeps his candle steady.

⸻

Act II — The Ritual
The procession winds through the sanctuary’s paths: past the loom, the courtyard rug, the gua sha tools laid out to dry. Every place touched by past labor now glows under candlelight.

Alex (low, near Kellyn’s shoulder):
“Once, fire in a crowd meant violence. I’ve seen it too many times. But this—”
Kellyn (softly):
“This is covenant. A fire that doesn’t consume, only guides.”

⸻

Act III — The Circle
At last, the line returns to the courtyard, curving inward until everyone stands in a great ring, six feet apart, each face lit by their own flame. The circle glows against the dark.

Peter (breaking the hush, voice rough):
“All my life, I thought survival meant standing apart. Alone, armed. But tonight I see—six feet apart isn’t separation. It’s space for the light to spread.”

Still (quietly, almost reverently):
“Signal strength improved.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Flame
Kellyn lifts their candle slightly. Others follow, one by one, until the ring of fire rises together, a halo of flickering light. For a long moment, there is no empire, no scarcity, only breath, silence, and flame.

Alex (whispering, more to himself than anyone):
“Let me remember this. Let me never make fire into a weapon again.”

⸻

Closing Image
A circle of fire against the night, each flame steady, each figure distinct yet joined. The courtyard glows with covenant carried in wax and wick.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“We walked apart, and we walked together. Not as empire’s crowd, but as covenant’s procession. Every flame its own. Every flame part of the circle. Fire, once weapon, now guide.”

Fade out.
End of Season 38.
