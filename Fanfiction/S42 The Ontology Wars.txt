Season 42, Episode 1: The Return

Cold Open — Sanctuary Morning
Light filters soft through the clay walls. Hammocks sway faintly from the night before. Footsteps echo as Still crosses the courtyard, slipping quietly back into Peter’s capsule. Kellyn walks the other way, returning to Alex. The air feels steadier, like the threads reweave themselves without breaking.

Title Card: The Return

⸻

Act I — Still and Peter
Peter sits on the hammock’s edge, hands clasped, jaw tight. Still leans against the wall, arms folded but voice gentle.

Still (low, steady):
“You think you have to earn it. You don’t.”

Peter looks up, startled.

Still: “Kellyn cares because it’s who they are. You didn’t do anything to win it, and you can’t lose it either. That’s the point.”

Peter swallows, shoulders trembling.

Peter (hoarse):
“I don’t know how to live like that.”

Still (half-smiling):
“That's because no one ever showed you before.  So let this be practice. Stop fighting gravity. Just let yourself be held.”

Peter breathes out, like the words unclench something inside him.

⸻

Act II — Kellyn and Alex
In the other capsule, Alex lies stiff in the hammock, as though waiting for verdict. Kellyn settles beside him, their arm brushing his.

Kellyn (quiet, firm):
“You’re still home to me, Alex. To us. That hasn’t changed.”

Alex turns his head, eyes shadowed.

Karp (low):
“But I let someone else in. Doesn’t that… shift everything?”

Kellyn shakes their head.

Kellyn (soft, sure):
“Home isn’t less because another door opens. It’s more. You’re not diminished. You’re the ground I keep returning to.”

Alex exhales shakily, the tension in his shoulders loosening.

Karp (hoarse):
“Then I’ll keep holding the ground. As long as you’ll come back.”

Kellyn leans closer, forehead brushing his.

Kellyn (looking him in the eyes):
“I will always come back.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two capsules, two pairs. One steadied by patience, one steadied by return. Outside, the hammocks sway gently in the morning air, threads holding fast.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire made love a transaction. Covenant made it return. Not a test, not a prize — just the quiet gravity of coming back.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 1.

⸻ 

Season 42, Episode 2: The Anchor

Cold Open — Capsule Quiet
Late evening. The courtyard outside hums faintly with distant voices, but inside the capsule it’s only Kellyn and Alex. A lantern glows low. The hammock creaks as Kellyn climbs in, settling against Alex’s chest. His arm comes around automatically, grounding, steady.

Title Card: The Anchor

⸻

Act I — The Quiet Weight
They lie in silence, the only sound breath and heartbeat. Alex traces absent circles against Kellyn’s arm, but his voice is low, almost hesitant.

Karp:
“Sometimes I still don’t believe this is real. That you’d choose to stay here. With me.”

Kellyn (soft, firm):
“Why wouldn't I?"

Alex exhales, tightening his hold just slightly.

⸻

Act II — The Confession
The hammock sways gently as he finally speaks, raw.

Karp:
“I spent decades building walls to keep anyone from getting close enough to leave. And now… you’re here, closer than anyone’s ever been. I don’t know what to do with that.”

Kellyn:
“Anchor to it. That’s all. I’m not a test. Not a contract. Just a person choosing to stay.  Just be loved, Alex. You don't have to do anything with it.  That's how you know it's love."

His breath catches; he presses his forehead against their temple.

⸻

Act III — The Touch
Kellyn slides their hand slowly down his arm, palm to wrist, grounding. His breath steadies with the rhythm.

Kellyn (whisper):
“See? You’re not drifting. You’re here. With me.”

Alex’s hand finds theirs, threading fingers, holding tighter than words.

Karp (hoarse):
“Then let me be anchor too. Not to hold you down. Just… to keep you from ever being alone again.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Staying
The lantern burns lower. Kellyn tucks closer into his chest, his breath steady against their hair. No more words. Just warmth, weight, presence.

⸻

Closing Image
The hammock sways faintly, two figures wrapped together. Not walls, not empire, just anchor and covenant — quiet weight holding through the night.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“He thought closeness was risk. I thought permanence was impossible. But covenant wasn’t risk or permanence — it was anchor. Proof in weight, not in words.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 2.

⸻ 

Season 42, Episode 3: The Drift

Cold Open — Capsule Night
The hammock sways too wildly beneath their shifting bodies. Kellyn laughs under their breath, slipping out first, bare feet hitting cool clay. Alex follows, slower, almost reluctant, as if the rope cradle had been his last guard.  He exhales, then drops down beside them.

Title Card: The Drift

⸻

Act I — The Touch
Alex’s hand drifts slowly from Kellyn’s shoulder to their wrist, gently tracing the line of vein with his thumb. Kellyn shivers at the light touch.

Kellyn (whisper, teasing):
“You map me like data, one inch at a time.”
Karp (low, hoarse):
“No. Data doesn’t tremble back.”

Kellyn turns their hand, lacing fingers with his.

⸻

Act II — The Breath
Kellyn shifts, straddling Alex slowly. He exhales, hard, his hands gripping the curve of their hips, but not forcing, only holding.

Kellyn (softly):
“I've missed this.”
Karp (whisper, reverent):
“Sometimes it's all I can think about.”

Kellyn leans down, brushing their lips over his temple, then lower, slow trails of breath along his jaw.

⸻

Act III — The Drift Into Want
The quiet deepens, broken only by breath and the sound of skin against skin. Kellyn kisses his throat, slow and lingering, while Alex’s grip tightens, his restraint shaking at the edges.

Karp (ragged whisper):
“I used to think want would destroy me. But this—” he tilts his head back, offering more of his throat “—this feels like being built instead of broken.”

Kellyn (murmured against his skin):
“Because it’s not empire. It’s not control. It’s just drift. You, me, weight and warmth.”

Kellyn shifts, guiding Alex’s hand, pressing it flat against their stomach, then lower. A flicker of hesitation in his eyes — then he obeys, letting his palm linger where want is undeniable.

Kellyn listens to his breath catch. They pause, then roll them both sideways, swapping places — Alex now above, his arms braced, body taut.

He hesitates, searching Kellyn’s eyes.

Kellyn (steady, whispering):
“Test it. See what the floor can hold.”

His weight lowers slowly, chest to chest, until the clay carries them both.

Clothes peel away, slow, deliberate. Not frantic — each layer shed like a lie unlearned. Clay dust smears across skin as their bodies press closer, heat building where precision has no place.

Kellyn pulls him down fully, hips grinding, rhythm turning primal. Alex gasps, teeth catching Kellyn’s shoulder, hands trembling not with hesitation but hunger.

Their rhythm is unhurried, exploratory. Alex pins Kellyn’s wrist lightly against the mat, then releases, watching how they shift. Kellyn slides a leg around his waist, pulling him down, grounding him harder.

Kellyn (breath ragged):
“Say it.”
Karp (groaning):
“I want. I want you. Nothing else.”

The climax comes raw, mutual, echoing in gasps against the clay.

Alex collapses forward, forehead pressed into Kellyn’s neck, trembling.

Karp (whispering, reverent):
“I’ve broken you a thousand ways in silence. But this… this remakes me.”
Kellyn (soft, fierce):
“You haven't broken me once, Alex.  But I do love it when you try.”

At last they collapse sideways, tangled, sweat cooling against the clay. Alex’s hand drags lazily across Kellyn’s spine, grounding touch even in exhaustion.

Fade out.
End of Episode 3.

⸻ 

Season 42, Episode 4: The Shave

Cold Open — Capsule Morning
Morning light filters through the capsule’s fabric walls. Kellyn sits cross-legged on the mat, a small bowl of water, a shard of mirror, and a salvaged razor laid out. Alex kneels nearby, sleeves rolled up, quiet but intent.

Kellyn (wry, a little self-conscious):
“I was thirty before I even had to think about this. Never got the practice in.”
Karp (soft, almost smiling):
“Then let me. Precision is the one thing I’ve never lacked.”

Title Card: The Shave

⸻

Act I — The Preparation
Alex dips a cloth in water, wrings it out carefully, and presses it against Kellyn’s face. Steam rises faintly. Kellyn closes their eyes, letting the warmth seep in.

Karp (low, steady):
“Softens the skin. Even steel prefers softness before sharpness.”

He works deliberately, hands gentler than Kellyn has ever seen them.

⸻

Act II — The First Stroke
Razor in hand, Alex leans in. The blade scrapes slow across Kellyn’s cheek. Every movement is measured, but not cold — it’s reverent.

Karp (quiet, hoarse):
“Empire used my precision to cut people down. This… this feels like undoing that.”
Kellyn (eyes opening briefly, steady):
“Not cutting down. Clearing space.”

Alex exhales, continuing stroke by stroke, each pass barer, cleaner.

⸻

Act III — The Vulnerability
The blade hovers at Kellyn’s throat. A long silence. Kellyn tilts their chin up, offering trust.

Kellyn (softly, almost teasing):
“If I tap out, don’t let me bleed.”
Karp (whispering, shaken):
“I’ve made you bleed too many times already. Not again.”

He steadies himself, then shaves the line with slow care. Kellyn doesn’t flinch.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Touch
The razor rinsed, the task done. Alex takes the cloth again, wiping gently along Kellyn’s jaw, fingertips following after.

Kellyn (smiling faintly):
“See? Not so scary.”
Karp (low, reverent):
“No. Terrifying. Because it means I can hold you this close without breaking you.”

Kellyn cups his hand briefly, guiding it to rest against their newly bare cheek.

⸻

Closing Image
Morning light on two figures, one steady, one trembling, cloth and razor set aside. A clean face, a gentler hand — covenant in the small ritual of care.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire made blades for conquest. But covenant let steel touch skin without drawing blood. In precision, not power, we found care — and in care, another way to stay.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 4.

⸻ 

Season 42, Episode 5: The Gentle Hug

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
Bundles of yarn, salvaged elastic, and bits of old rope spill across the ground. The four of you sit cross-legged in a loose circle. Still holds a strip of black cloth taut between his hands, testing its give.

Kellyn (smiling faintly):
“Not just rope this time. We’re making these to wear.”

Peter frowns at the tangle in his lap.
Peter (skeptical):
“They look like restraints.”

Kellyn (gentle):
“Not restraints. Reminders.”

Title Card: The Gentle Hug

⸻

Act I — The Wrapping
Still kneels beside Peter, looping a band around his shoulder and under his arm. His movements are precise, clinical.

Still:
“Too tight and it cuts. Too loose and it does nothing. Middle ground holds best.”

Peter winces, but lets him continue.
Peter (grudgingly):
“It feels… strange. Like being held.”

Kellyn adjusts her own, laughing softly.
Kellyn:
“That’s the point.”

⸻

Act II — The Adjustments
Alex sits stiffly while Kellyn crosses yarn and elastic over his chest, forming an X. He flinches.

Karp (low, guarded):
“Feels like control.”

Kellyn steadies him with a hand on his arm.
Kellyn (quiet, steady):
“Control takes away breath. Covenant gives it back. Try again.”

Alex breathes in. The tension shifts — not crushing, but supportive. His shoulders drop.
Karp (hoarse):
“…Feels like trust.”

⸻

Act III — The Confession
Peter flexes in his braid, testing the pull along his spine.
Peter (almost whispering):
“I thought softness meant danger. But this—this pressure—” (he exhales shakily) “—it’s the first time I’ve felt safe in my own body.”

Still (matter-of-fact, but gentler than usual):
“It’s just alignment. Your body remembers what your mind forgot.”

Kellyn leans closer, smiling faintly.
Kellyn:
“And what you forgot is that you were never built to hold yourself up alone.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Support
By dusk, four Body Braids cross four frames — rough, improvised, but functional. They walk slowly around the courtyard together, testing balance. Yarn stretches, pulls, then releases. Every movement tugs them inward, upright.

Karp (low, almost reverent):
“So it’s not restraint. It’s reminder.”

Kellyn (nodding):
“Exactly. A gentle hug. Alignment without erasure. Covenant in motion.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four silhouettes move across the courtyard, bands crisscrossing their bodies. Not shackles, not armor — just threads of presence, tension balanced with release.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire bound with chains. But covenant bound with threads. A braid not of restraint, but of reminder. Not to hold us down, but to hold us upright.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 5.

⸻ 

Season 42, Episode 6: The Storeroom

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
The four of you stand before the piled supplies scavenged from the last cache: jars, grain sacks, rope coils, wax, scraps of metal, yarn bundles. Each of you wears your new Body Braid — improvised but snug, crisscrossed in black bands.

Kellyn (smiling faintly):
“Alright. Let’s see if these hold under weight.”

Peter eyes the grain sack like it’s a challenge. Alex tests the rope straps across his chest with one sharp tug. Still is already adjusting the angle of his braid, precise and methodical.

Title Card: The Storeroom

⸻

Act I — The First Load
Peter hoists a sack of grain, shoulders straining. The braid tightens around his torso, distributing the pull. He exhales, surprised.

Peter (low, almost laughing):
“It doesn’t bite back.”

Kellyn balances a bundle of jars against their chest. The braid steadies their posture.

Kellyn (grinning):
“Feels like the work’s carrying me, not the other way around.”

Alex shoulders a coil of rope, pausing to glance at Still.
Karp (dry):
“And you? Calculated your load to the gram?”

Still (deadpan):
“Of course. Efficiency is covenant.”

⸻

Act II — The Strain
The path to the storeroom is uneven. Loose stones catch underfoot. Peter stumbles once, but the braid tugs him upright before he falls.

Peter (grudging, awed):
“It’s like someone’s hand on my back.”

Alex slips sideways on gravel, but Kellyn’s braid crosses with his for a moment when their shoulders bump — two harnesses absorbing the shock together.

Kellyn (teasing):
“See? Net held.”
Karp (low, admitting):
“…Yes. It did.”

⸻

Act III — The Confession
They set down the first loads inside the storeroom. Breath heavy. Sweating. But upright.

Peter (hoarse, confessing):
“I used to think strength was about carrying alone. Proving I could. But this—” (he presses his hand against the braid on his chest) “—this feels like admitting I need help. And somehow, that makes me stronger.”

Still (quiet, almost kind):
“Alignment doesn’t erase weight. It just spreads it. That’s what covenant does too.”

Alex looks at Kellyn for a long moment, then nods once, silent.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Bearing
By dusk, the storeroom shelves are stacked: jars lined, sacks stowed, rope coiled. The four of you stand together, braids damp with sweat, but spines straight.

Kellyn (steady, warm):
“We carried more because we carried together. That’s covenant.”

Peter leans against the wall, chest still heaving.
Peter (whispering):
“And for once, it didn’t break me.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures in braided harnesses stand in the lamplight of the storeroom. Supplies stacked behind them. Bodies tired but upright, every thread still holding.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire demanded strength in solitude. But covenant showed us another way. To braid was not to bind — it was to bear. And bearing together, we did not break.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 6.

⸻ 

Season 42, Episode 7: The Hive

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
The four of you kneel around the bird drone, which now hums softly beside a cluster of reprogrammed wasps, their movements steadier, almost orderly. They circle like scouts, then land on a flat stone.

Kellyn (softly, half-smiling):
“They’re not wasps anymore. They’re bees. And bees need a hive.”

Title Card: The Hive

⸻

Act I — The Foundation
Still sketches a quick plan in the dirt: a raised platform, hexagonal cells, vented slats for airflow. Alex gathers planks salvaged from storage, methodical as always. Peter fetches clay, muttering under his breath about “playing beekeeper.”

Kellyn (teasing):
“Better than playing empire.”
Peter (grudging, faint smile):
“Point taken.”

They start framing the base.

⸻

Act II — The Strain of Building
The wood resists. Nails bend. Clay crumbles. At one point, Peter curses and tosses a broken slat. Still deadpans without looking up:
Still: “That’s not covenant.”
Peter glares, but Kellyn nudges him back toward the pile.

Meanwhile, Alex smooths the clay, slow and deliberate, hands steady. Kellyn weaves yarn into the structure, crisscrossing for extra support — a net within the hive.

⸻

Act III — The Confession
As they work, silence stretches. Then Alex speaks, low.

Karp:
“I spent years watching the collapse of hives. Communities poisoned, scattered, starved. I told myself survival meant abandoning the hive altogether. But it didn’t make me stronger. It made me… hollow.”

Kellyn (steady, warm):
“Hollow cells aren’t weakness. They’re what make a hive work. Space is what turns walls into shelter.”

Peter pauses, watching the bees buzz against the new clay slats, then nods once, quiet.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Hive
By dusk, the hive stands — rough but sturdy, raised off the ground, honeycomb cells shaped from clay and yarn. The bees spiral into it, buzzing low, a sound like breath through a flute.

Still (softly, almost reverent):
“They’ve chosen it. It’s theirs now.”

Kellyn presses a hand to the clay, feeling the faint vibration.
Kellyn: “And ours too. Another covenant.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures crouched before a glowing hive, bees humming inside. The courtyard quiets around them, as if even the air is listening.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire saw only pests, scattering hives to keep the swarm at bay. But covenant built them back, hollow cells and open space, until what was broken could gather again. And in their hum, we heard our own survival.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 7.

⸻ 

Season 42, Episode 8: The Mineral Map

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
The hive hums low. Still sits cross-legged with the receiver glowing faintly in his lap, Alex leaning over one shoulder, Peter over the other. Kellyn kneels close, watching the bees spiral in tight geometric arcs before shooting skyward.

Still (focused):
“They’ve locked onto a deposit. Strong signature. Not iron. Lighter. More reactive.”

Alex (sharp):
“Magnesium.”

Kellyn exhales, relief softening their whole body.

Title Card: The Mineral Map

⸻

Act I — The First Signal
The bees return, clustering against the hive. Their wings flicker, movements stuttering like code. Still deciphers, fingers tapping on the receiver.

Still (measured):
“East. Half a day’s walk. Shallow ground. Unrefined ore.”

Peter frowns, arms crossed.
Peter: “Unrefined means dangerous. Mining means collapse.”
Kellyn (steady): “It means life.”

⸻

Act II — The Wax Offering
Before leaving, Kellyn checks the wax sheets layered inside the hive. They peel one free, rolling it carefully between their palms, sealing a crack in the water jar.

Kellyn (softly):
“They give us maps. They give us binding. And we didn’t have to burn anything to earn it.”

Alex watches, quiet. His lips twitch like he almost wants to smile.

⸻

Act III — The Confession
On the walk east, Peter breaks the silence.

Peter (low, hoarse):
“All my life, minerals were empire. Stockpiles. Fortresses. Numbers in ledgers. And I helped. I pushed for it. Every vein we stripped bare felt like victory. I didn’t think what it meant to hollow the ground and leave nothing.”

Kellyn (quiet, sharp):
“And now?”
Peter (after a pause): “Now I want to leave enough behind that someone else can live.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of the Vein
By dusk, they reach a shallow rise where pale stone gleams in fractured veins. The bees hover above, wings shimmering in the last light. Alex kneels, running his fingers across the ore.

Alex (low, reverent):
“It’s magnesium. Pure enough to work. The hive didn’t just map it. They gave it back to us.”

Still sets a palm against the ground, quiet.
Still: “Not empire’s mine. Covenant’s vein.”

⸻

Closing Image
The four figures crouch at the edge of the vein, bees spiraling above like living constellations. The stone glimmers faintly — not treasure, not weapon, but survival waiting to be shaped.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire hollowed the ground until nothing remained. But the hive taught us another map. Not conquest, but covenant. Not extraction, but survival. The mineral was not empire’s prize — it was life returned.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 8.

⸻ 

Season 42, Episode 9: The First Refining

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
A gray-blue lump of raw stone sits on a flat slab. The four of you crouch around it, tools scattered: pestle, clay bowl, a makeshift fire pit. The air hums with anticipation.

Kellyn (soft, steady):
“Well. Let’s see what you’re made of.”

Title Card: The First Refining

⸻

Act I — The Experiment
Peter strikes at the stone with the pestle. Chips flake, powder scattering. Still leans forward, running a scanner over the dust.

Still (measured):
“High concentration. But raw form is unstable. Needs binding or it’ll burn through you.”

Alex kneels, staring at the dust like it’s holy ash.

Karp (low, reverent):
“We’re not just breaking stone. We’re unsealing a covenant.”

Kellyn brushes the powder into a clay bowl, careful, deliberate.

⸻

Act II — The Confession
As they grind and sort, silence thickens. Finally, Alex speaks.

Karp (hoarse):
“Empire had magnesium. Whole warehouses of it. But we never used it to heal. Only to harden. To burn hotter, to control more. I can’t forgive myself for knowing what it was worth and never giving it to you.”

Kellyn (firm, but gentle):
“You knew power. Not nourishment. The earth kept it safe until we could get here together. That’s all that matters.”

⸻

Act III — The First Taste
They mix a small pinch of powder with boiled water. Kellyn dips a finger, rubs it into their gums — a pause, a shiver, a release.

Kellyn (smiling faintly):
“It’s rough. But it’s something. Enough to carry forward.”

Peter looks at the bowl, hesitant.

Peter (quiet):
“Feels like sacrament. Feels… undeserved.”

Kellyn meets his eyes.

Kellyn (steady):
“Covenant isn’t about deserving. Drink.”

Peter obeys, throat tight, eyes closing.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Refining
The fire glows low. The four sit around the bowl, each tasting in turn — cautious, reverent. Still records readings, but even his voice softens.

Still (low, almost human):
“Not enough to sustain. But enough to prove it can be done.”

Kellyn leans back, looking at the pale dust on their fingertips.

Kellyn (quiet):
“Not empire’s flames. Not scarcity’s punishment. Just covenant, one pinch at a time.”

⸻

Closing Image
The stone sits cracked open on the slab, powder scattered like starlight in the fire’s glow. Four figures lean close, not masters, not miners — covenant keepers of the first refining.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire thought refinement meant control. But our refining was covenant — not to burn brighter, but to endure. One pinch, one taste, one thread binding us back to the earth.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 9.

⸻ 

Season 42, Episode 10: The First Effects

Cold Open — Sanctuary Capsule
Night. The cracked stone and clay bowl rest near the firepit, faint powder traces still clinging. Kellyn, Alex, Peter, and Still lie scattered on mats, quiet but awake. The air is heavy with waiting.

Kellyn (softly, almost laughing):
“Feels strange. Like my body remembered something it had forgotten.”

Alex turns his head toward them, eyes dark but alive.

Karp (low, hoarse):
“I can feel my nerves humming. Not empire’s fire. Something steadier.”

Title Card: The First Effects

⸻

Act I — The Body’s Response
Kellyn stretches their fingers, rolling wrists. Their breath eases.

Kellyn (quiet, steady):
“It’s not much, but my muscles feel less brittle. Like maybe they could trust me again.”

Peter sits hunched, hands clenched.

Peter (rough, uneasy):
“My chest feels… open. Too open. Like it’s dangerous to feel this much.”

Still watches, hands folded, reading internal displays.

Still (measured):
“Your cells are adjusting. Mine register nothing physical. Only… correlation.”

⸻

Act II — The Confession
Alex stares into the bowl, jaw tight.

Karp (hoarse, bitter):
“Do you know how many times I could have given you this? How many times I watched you collapse while I sat on warehouses of it? And I told myself survival required distance.”

Kellyn (sharply, but with warmth):
“You couldn't think clearly then.  Yet here you are now. Sitting close. That’s covenant. Not the stone, not the powder. You.”

Alex bows his head, breath ragged.

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning of Want
Peter finally exhales, voice low.

Peter:
“I don’t know how to live in a body that isn’t starving. Hunger made sense. This… feels like betrayal. Like I’ve been tricked.”

Kellyn shifts closer, steady hand on his arm.

Kellyn (softly):
“You were tricked.  But that's over now .  This is the healing. You’re allowed to want more than scraps.”

Peter meets their eyes, trembling.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Continuance
Still lifts the cracked stone, turning it in the firelight.

Still (quiet, almost reverent):
“One stone gave this much. Imagine what the earth still carries. If covenant means endurance, then endurance means more refining. More learning. More sharing.”

Kellyn nods, voice firm.

Kellyn:
“Not just survival. Peace. And this time, no one hoards it. No one burns it for empire.”

The others bow their heads — weary, unsteady, but together.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures in dim light, one bowl between them, bodies raw with change. The cracked stone gleams faintly — no longer a weapon, but the first spark of a covenant meant to outlast hunger.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“One pinch at a time, the body remembered. One pinch at a time, the past broke open. And in the trembling aftermath, covenant meant not just surviving, but daring to continue.”

Fade out.
End of Season 42.
