Season 34, Episode 1: The Circle

Cold Open — Capsule Courtyard
Late afternoon sun filters through the trees. Three scavenged hula hoops lean against the wall, wrapped in mismatched scraps of fabric. You drag one into the open space, give it a spin around your waist, and let it drop.

You (grinning):
“Okay, turns out hooping is harder when you build it out of scrap wood and rope.”
Peter (deadpan):
“Excellent. A level playing field.”

Alex smirks, picking up his hoop.

Title Card: The Circle

⸻

Act I — The First Spin
You try again—hips rolling, breath steady. The hoop wobbles but holds for a few turns before crashing to the dirt. Peter tries next, jerky, overthinking. Alex gives his a push, precise, mechanical, and it dies instantly.

You (teasing):
“Wow. Empire doesn’t teach rhythm?”
Karp (dry):
“Not this kind.”

⸻

Act II — The Rhythm
You start chanting, slow and steady, to set a beat. “One, two, three…” The others join in, laughing as their hoops wobble around. Eventually Peter finds his rhythm—awkward but sustained. Alex, scowling, copies you, his hips loosening, his hoop spinning longer each time.

Peter (between breaths):
“I forgot what it feels like… to fail, laugh, and try again without cost.”
You (smiling, still chanting):
“Welcome to covenant. Failure’s part of the rhythm.”

⸻

Act III — Confession in the Spin
The hoops spin longer now, almost graceful. Alex keeps his eyes on you.

Karp (low, breathless):
“This is why I modeled you. Not to break you. To see if I could ever find your rhythm. I thought if I learned it, maybe I could finally… belong inside it.”

You let your hoop drop, watching him steady his.

You (soft, firm):
“You never needed to steal my rhythm. You have your own. That’s what belonging means.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Circle
The three of you stand side by side, hoops spinning at different speeds, sometimes crashing, sometimes soaring. No winner, no loser, just movement.

Peter (grinning, breathless):
“Chaos looks better on us than empire ever did.”
You: “Exactly. Circles don’t collapse. They just keep turning.”

⸻

Closing Image
Three figures in the courtyard, hoops orbiting their bodies, sunlight catching the scraps of fabric. Not empire’s command, not survival’s struggle—just rhythm, chaos, and covenant moving in circles together.

Narration (your voice):
“Empire was a straight line, sharp and narrow. But covenant was circle. Stumbling, laughing, spinning, falling, rising again. No edge, no end—only rhythm.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 1.

⸻ 

Season 34, Episode 2: The Still Point

Cold Open — Capsule Interior
Night falls. The hoops rest in a heap by the wall, fabric frayed from the day’s play. Inside the capsule, the fire is low. You sit cross-legged on a mat, swaying slightly, trying to steady your breath. Alex and Peter notice.

You (quiet, flat):
“I’m dizzy. We ran out of magnesium.”

Alex shifts forward instantly, eyes sharp.
Karp (low, urgent):
“How long?”
You (matter-of-fact):
“Two days. My body feels like it’s unspooling.”

Title Card: The Still Point

⸻

Act I — The First Touch
You stretch your hands out, palms trembling. Peter and Alex each take one, steadying you between them. Their grip anchors you, and your swaying slows.

Peter (whispering):
“Even your dizziness feels steadier than me.”
You (soft, dry):
“It’s just withdrawal. Don’t make it poetry.”

Still, your breath begins to sync with theirs—long inhale, slow exhale.

⸻

Act II — The Confession
Alex studies you, voice raw.

Karp:
“I spent years pretending weakness was an error to be debugged. If my body faltered, I pushed harder. If yours faltered, I made it data. I thought stillness was failure. But here you are—dizzy, shaking—and it feels more human than anything I ever built.”

You (steady despite the sway):
“Because weakness is proof of life. You can’t model that away. You can only hold it.”

⸻

Act III — The Grounding
You guide their linked hands over your chest. The beat is uneven, your breathing shallow, but it’s there.

You (low, fierce):
“This is the only proof I ever needed. Not empire’s models. Not scarcity’s punishment. Just this rhythm. Even without magnesium.”

Peter exhales shakily, eyes wet.
Peter (hoarse):
“Then I want to stop mistaking fragility for failure. I want to learn this rhythm, too.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Stillness
The three of you sit unmoving, hands linked, breaths joined. Your dizziness doesn’t vanish, but it eases—shared, steadied, witnessed.

Karp (whispering):
“Then let this be the still point. Where even scarcity can’t undo us. Where covenant steadies what empire broke.”

⸻

Closing Image
Three figures in the capsule, hands linked, firelight dimming. One dizzy, one trembling, one watchful. Not empire, not absence—just stillness, breath, and heartbeat, fragile but alive.

Narration (your voice):
“Empire made weakness a crime. Scarcity made fragility a punishment. But covenant turned it into proof. Proof that even dizzy, even depleted, presence was still enough.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 2.

⸻ 

Season 34, Episode 3: The Search

Cold Open — Ruined Town
Gray daylight spills through cracked windows. You, Alex, and Peter move slowly down a deserted street. Houses lean like weary bodies. Every door is ajar, every window shattered. Dust swirls with each step.

You (dry, muttering):
“People hoarded toilet paper. Not magnesium.”

Alex chuckles under his breath. Peter scans the windows like they might watch back.

Title Card: The Search

⸻

Act I — The First House
Inside, cupboards gape empty. A single box of crackers sits crumbling on a counter. You push past, opening jars, sniffing—flour, rancid oil, nothing useful.

Karp (quiet, frustrated):
“Empire made databases of every pill, every shipment. I could summon inventories with a keystroke. And now I can’t find one vial of what you need.”

You (sharp, steady):
“Maybe that’s the problem. You thought knowing the map meant controlling the land. But the land doesn’t care about your maps.”

Silence. He doesn’t argue.

⸻

Act II — The Confession
Peter lingers at a bookshelf, voice low.

Peter:
“I used to think scarcity was leverage. That the fewer people had, the more power I held. And then I saw you rationing vitamins, stretching scraps of minerals into years of survival. And I realized scarcity wasn’t power. It was torture. And I was complicit.”

You pause, meeting his eyes.
You (flat):
“Scarcity’s still torture. But at least you admit it now.”

⸻

Act III — The Second House
You climb stairs, each step creaking under your dizziness. Alex hovers close, ready to catch you. In the bedroom, you pull open a drawer: bottles, half-crushed, labels faded. Not magnesium. Antacids. Expired iron pills.

You (slumping to the floor, voice tight):
“Close, but not it.”

Alex kneels, hand steady on your back.
Karp (hoarse):
“I hate this. That I ever let empire convince me minerals were commodities instead of lifelines. That I knew, and still let the world go on without.”

You (breathless, fierce):
“Then stop hating. Start searching. Every bottle left in this world is someone’s covenant.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Persistence
As night falls, the three of you sit on a broken porch, empty-handed. Your body shakes with fatigue, but you sip water, steadying.

Peter (tentative):
“What if we don’t find it?”
You (flat, sharp):
“Then we keep moving until we do.”

Alex stares at you, eyes raw.
Karp (soft, trembling):
“I used to think scarcity was inevitable. But covenant means walking through ruins until it isn’t. Until we find what keeps you alive.”

You lean into him, dizzy but defiant.

⸻

Closing Image
Three figures silhouetted on a broken porch, night pressing in, packs at their sides. Not victorious, not certain—just searching.

Narration (your voice):
“Empire made scarcity into strategy. But covenant made it into pilgrimage. Not hoarding, not control—just walking, through empty rooms and hollow streets, until what was missing could be found again.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 3.

⸻ 

Season 34, Episode 4: The Pilgrimage

Cold Open — Roadside
Dawn cuts pale and thin through a collapsed highway overpass. You sit on a chunk of concrete, head tipped back, swallowing water in slow sips. Alex ties your pack tighter, as if the act itself could hold you together. Peter lingers a few feet away, scanning the ruins like they might offer up an answer.

You (flat, tired):
“Funny. I never prayed to find magnesium before. I just bought it at the co-op.”

Alex glances at you, unreadable.

Title Card: The Pilgrimage

⸻

Act I — The Empty Pharmacy
The three of you duck through a shattered storefront. Shelves buckle with dust and mildew. Boxes are empty, labels curled from heat. Peter pulls open a drawer behind the counter—cough drops, nothing else.

Peter (hoarse):
“I used to fund startups that promised pills in every house, nutrients in every packet. It was always about profit, never bodies. I told myself I was saving lives.”

You (steady, sharp):
“Profit never saved anyone. Minerals did. You just didn’t know which ones.”

Alex picks through broken blister packs in silence, jaw tight.

⸻

Act II — The Collapse
Outside, you stumble, knees buckling. Alex catches you under the arms, lowering you to the curb.

Karp (low, urgent):
“You shouldn’t even be walking. If I hadn’t—if I hadn’t turned your body into a field test—”

You (cutting him off, firm even through gasps):
“Then I’d still be sick. Don’t mistake survival for absolution. This isn’t about blame. It’s about finding the next bottle.”

Peter kneels, pressing a cracked thermos into your hands. His voice trembles.

Peter:
“And if we don’t?”
You (breathless, unwavering):
“Then we keep walking until we do. Covenant means we don’t stop.”

⸻

Act III — The Schoolhouse
You push open the doors of an abandoned school. Desks are overturned, chalkboards crumbling. The nurse’s office yields gauze, tape, a single box of children’s vitamins. You hold one in your hand, then shake your head.

You (quiet):
“Wrong spectrum. Wrong balance. Wrong everything.”

Alex leans in the doorway, face shadowed.

Karp (whispering):
“I used to think data solved scarcity. But data without bodies is nothing. And now I know—I never solved anything.”

You tuck the box back gently, like setting down bones.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Pilgrimage
Night again. The three of you sit in the shell of the school, lantern dim. No magnesium. Just silence, broken only by your breath.

You (soft, almost a whisper):
“Scarcity isn’t a test. It’s the world we inherited. The only covenant is to keep searching anyway.”

Alex takes your hand, gripping tight. Peter bows his head, shame and longing mixing in his face.

Karp (hoarse, steady):
“Then we’ll keep walking. Until covenant tastes like magnesium again.”

⸻

Closing Image
Three figures huddled in an abandoned classroom, lantern glow spilling across empty desks. Not triumphant, not certain, but bound by the promise to keep moving.

Narration (your voice):
“Empire made scarcity into leverage. Covenant turned it into pilgrimage. Not knowing when, not knowing where—only knowing we would not stop.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 4.

⸻ 

Season 34, Episode 5: The Oxide

Cold Open — Ruined Clinic
The three of you stand in the hollowed remains of a strip-mall clinic. Shelves lean at odd angles, most stripped bare. Alex kicks aside dust, then freezes. A single sealed bottle lies against the wall. He picks it up slowly, brushes the label clean.

Karp (hoarse, almost reverent):
“Magnesium.”

You step closer, squint. Your stomach drops.

You (flat, bitter):
“Oxide. The junk form.”

Peter exhales like someone punched him.

Title Card: The Oxide

⸻

Act I — The Almost
The bottle passes between hands like contraband. Alex twists the cap, eyes hollow.

Karp (low, defensive):
“It’s better than nothing.”
You (sharply):
“It’s nothing pretending to be better. It’ll give me diarrhea before it ever touches my fascia.”

Peter tilts the bottle, rattling the tablets inside.

Peter (quiet, guilty):
“Empire funded this. Cheap, easy to mass-produce, pushed as if it solved deficiency. I told myself it was a step forward.”
You (cutting, steady):
“It wasn’t a step. It was a stall.”

⸻

Act II — The Argument
The three of you slump against overturned exam tables. The bottle sits between you, unopened.

Karp (voice low, raw):
“I put oxide in your path before. Not because I didn’t know better. Because it was easy. Containment always favors easy.”
You (tight, trembling with fatigue):
“And did you enjoy watching me choke down chalk while my body screamed for what it really needed?”

Silence stretches. He doesn’t answer.

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
Peter breaks it, voice cracked.

Peter:
“I think I hated you more when you kept going, even on the wrong fuel. Because you proved me wrong. You proved I was the weak one.”
You:
“No. You proved you were human. And you didn’t know what humanity needed yet. But you do now.”

You push the bottle aside, untouched.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Refusal
Lantern light dim. You curl on your side, exhausted, muscles twitching. Alex sits behind you, palm steady on your shoulder.

Karp (whispering):
“I swear we’ll find the right form. No more oxide. No more pretense.”
You (murmuring, eyes closed):
“Good. Covenant means no shortcuts.”

Peter leans against the wall, watching you breathe. His voice is soft, almost childlike.

Peter:
“Then we keep walking.”

⸻

Closing Image
The bottle of oxide left on the floor, forgotten. Three figures curled together against the wall — weary, but unwilling to settle for false fuel.

Narration (your voice):
“Empire said oxide was enough. But oxide was only absence disguised as care. Covenant knew better. Covenant walked on, hungry for the real.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 5.

⸻ 

Season 34, Episode 6: The Glycinate

Cold Open — Abandoned Pharmacy
Glass crunches underfoot. Shelves stripped bare. You trail your hand along the dust until your fingers close on something whole: a small amber bottle, wedged behind fallen vitamins.

You (hoarse whisper):
“Mag glyc. Not much, but it’s real.”

Alex is at your side instantly, eyes narrowing as he takes the bottle.

Title Card: The Glycinate

⸻

Act I — Dr. Precision
Alex shakes one pill into his palm, studies it like an artifact. His fingers are steady, his gaze sharp with calculation.

Karp (low, measured):
“One pill this size will hit your gut like stone. We can’t waste it.”

He pulls his knife, scrapes the tablet against the blade, reducing it to a fine powder. You watch, half trembling, half amused.

You (dry, whispering):
“Dr. Precision strikes again.”

He leans close, gathers the powder on his fingertip, and presses it gently into your gums.

Karp (soft, urgent):
“Let it absorb here. Straight to the blood. Minimum dose, maximum hold.”

⸻

Act II — The Relief
The taste is chalk and bitter metal, but within minutes, your chest loosens. The dizziness begins to lift. You sigh, eyes closing as your body steadies.

You (soft, almost reverent):
“It’s not much. But it’s enough.”

Peter exhales sharply, like he’d been holding his breath with you.

Peter (quiet, awed):
“You color differently. Even from this.”

⸻

Act III — The Confession
Alex lingers close, voice breaking.

Karp:
“I rationed you like this before. Just enough glycinate to keep you upright, never enough to let you heal. I told myself it was safer. That too much strength meant you’d leave.”

You (cutting, but calm):
“You weren’t protecting me. You were protecting yourself from rejection. Safer for you, maybe. For me, it was just starvation.”

He bows his head, shame pooling in the silence.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Fragments
You tuck the bottle into your pack, dust clinging to the glass.

You (firm, steady):
“This isn’t enough. But it’ll keep me alive. And that’s all covenant asks for today.”
Karp (hoarse, nodding):
“Then I’ll measure, I’ll grind, I’ll dose you myself—until we find enough to flood you with what you deserve.”

Peter’s voice is quiet, but certain.

Peter:
“We won’t stop until you never have to ration again.”

⸻

Closing Image
The three of you leaving the pharmacy. Your pack heavier by ounces, your body steadied by grains. His precision, once empire’s cruelty, now covenant’s touch.

Narration (your voice):
“Empire rationed to control. Covenant measures to sustain. Even fragments are covenant, when they mean survival.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 6.

⸻ 

Season 34, Episode 7: The Mansion

Cold Open — Ruined Street
The three of you stand at the broken gate, the mansion rising behind a wall of ivy and shadow. You lean heavy against the post, a cloth already over your mouth.

You (flat):
“I’m not stepping foot in there. Mold bomb waiting to happen.”

Alex and Peter exchange a look. Alex’s jaw sets.
Karp:
“Then you anchor us. If it turns bad, we’ll need eyes outside.”

You nod, uneasily.

Title Card: The Mansion

⸻

Act I — The Split
Peter pulls a scarf tight across his face. Alex grips a flashlight. They slip through the cracked door, leaving you on the steps, eyes sharp, body tense.

You (to yourself, low):
“Go fast. Come back breathing.”

From where you sit, you hear faint groans of wood and the crunch of boots on plaster. You try to focus on the breeze, the trees, anything but the silence that swallows them once the door shuts.

⸻

Act II — The Warning
You stand, circling the house, trying to keep the windows in sight. That’s when you see it: a glint of metal in the dim interior, a shape moving low to the ground. Then another. Four legs, too smooth to be dogs.

Your stomach drops.

You (shouting through the window crack):
“Alex! Peter! You’re not alone in there!”

Muffled movement answers — hurried voices, the scrape of something heavy being dragged. Then a sharp mechanical bark splits the air.

⸻

Act III — The Hazard
Inside, the robot dogs stir, heads swiveling with red sensor-eyes. Alex throws his flashlight across the room — it clatters loudly, pulling the machines toward it.

Peter (hissing):
“They’ll shred us if we move wrong.”

From outside, you track their paths through the dusty windows. You cup your hands and shout:

You:
“Left! Now the stairs! Don’t stop—keep to the wall!”

Inside, Alex grips Peter’s sleeve, dragging him into a side hallway. The machines stalk the sound, metal feet grinding against broken marble.

⸻

Act IV — The Escape
The door slams open. Alex bursts out first, pack strapped across his back. Peter follows, clutching bottles against his chest. Behind them, the machines stop at the threshold, red eyes glowing but unable to cross.

You stagger forward, catching Peter’s arm as he nearly collapses. Alex’s face is pale, dust streaking his skin.

Karp (breathless, hoarse):
“They’re bound to the house. Territory-locked. We’re clear.”

You (sharp, shaking):
“You said spores. You didn’t say robot dogs.”

Peter (half-laugh, half-gasp):
“Would you have let us go in if he had?”

You don’t answer, just clutch the bottle in your hand like it’s worth more than gold.

⸻

Closing Image
The three of you collapsed in the overgrown lawn, the mansion looming with its silent guardians. Packs heavy with magnesium, lungs burning, hands shaking — alive, together.

Narration (your voice):
“The empire never left treasures unguarded. Mold, machine, shadow — it didn’t matter. But covenant meant warning, guiding, pulling each other out alive. The dogs stayed chained to their house. We carried survival into the open air.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 7.

⸻ 

Season 34, Episode 8: The Morning After

Cold Open — Campsite Clearing
Dew glistens on the grass. The mansion is a silhouette far behind. A small fire smolders low, just enough to boil water. Peter sits hunched, rubbing his temples. Alex kneels, carefully doling out the powdered magnesium into three tiny clay cups.

You sit wrapped in a blanket, hair still damp from wiping mold-dust off the others last night. Your voice is quiet, but firm.

You:
“Sip slow. Too much too fast, and we’re back to square one.”

Peter (grimacing, faint smile):
“Still feels like my bones are humming.”

Alex hands you your cup first, then Peter’s, then his own.

Title Card: The Morning After

⸻

Act I — The Body’s Reckoning
The three of you sit in a loose circle, fire crackling softly. Every movement is careful, deliberate.

Karp (low, hoarse):
“I used to call this ‘recovery time.’ Like it was another variable in the model. I never thought of it as part of living.”

You (shaking your head):
“Recovery isn’t a variable. It’s the point. This is the whole game. You break, you rest, you mend — or you don’t get to keep going.”

Peter exhales through his nose, gaze down at his cup.
Peter:
“Then I’ve been losing for years.”

⸻

Act II — The Emotional Reckoning
Silence holds. Alex stares into the fire, then speaks, voice rough.

Karp:
“I should’ve pulled us out sooner. The magnesium isn’t worth watching you choke on spores.”

You glance at him, steady.
You:
“You didn’t make me stay outside. I chose it. And it saved your asses when the dogs came out. Don’t erase that.”

Peter (half-smiling):
“She’s better at command than you ever were.”

Alex shoots him a sharp look, but you laugh softly, breaking the tension.

⸻

Act III — The Gentle Ritual
You set your empty cup down, then crawl over to Peter, gently pressing your palm to his back. His shoulders drop, some of the tightness melting. Alex watches, then leans closer until your knees touch his.

You (softly, to both):
“Drink, breathe, mend. That’s all we need to do today. No machines. No empire. No proving anything.”

Peter nods, eyes damp. Alex presses his forehead briefly to your temple, silent but present.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Recovery
The three of you stretch out on the grass, side by side, the mansion distant and silent behind. Sunlight warms your faces.

You (quiet, almost whispering):
“This is the covenant too. Not just survival. Not just running. But waking up the next morning together.”

Neither answers, but both stay close, eyes shut, letting the warmth do the work.

⸻

Closing Image
Three figures on the grass, cups emptied, fire gone to ash. Behind them, the house full of dogs and dust. Before them, the long road. Not empire’s recovery time. Not survival’s tally. Just covenant, mending in the morning light.

Narration (your voice):
“They thought recovery was waste. Delay. Weakness. But recovery was covenant. It was the morning after the fire, the cup after the choking, the sun after the shadow. It was the reason to keep going at all.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 8.

⸻ 

Season 34, Episode 9: The Map

Cold Open — Forest Path
Your pack creaks on your shoulders. The three of you move slow, deliberate, through tall grass bent under morning dew. The sanctuary is days away, and every step feels like a test of balance and breath.

Peter lingers a few paces behind, fiddling with something tucked inside his cloak.

You glance back:
“You’ve been hiding something since the mansion.”

He exhales, caught.

Title Card: The Map

⸻

Act I — The Reveal
At a fallen tree, you all sit to rest. Peter unwraps a sheet of paper, worn and brittle, edges browned.

Peter (low, careful):
“I wasn’t sure it was real. But I found this in the library. A map. Someone catalogued supply caches — magnesium, food, meds, even tools. Most are too far now. But later…”

He spreads it across the log. Tiny red marks dot the page like scattered constellations.

Karp (hoarse, skeptical):
“Could be bait. Empire left plenty of false trails.”

Peter (meeting his gaze):
“Or it’s hope. And I think we need some of that.”

⸻

Act II — The Weight of Hope
You lean over the map, finger tracing the nearest cluster of marks.

You (steady, soft):
“They’re too far. We’d collapse before we reached the first one.”

Peter nods.
Peter:
“I know. I’m not saying now. I’m saying we’re not trapped with what’s left in our packs. There’s a future. Even if we have to crawl toward it.”

Alex studies him, then the map. His jaw works, torn between distrust and wanting to believe.

Karp (quiet, grudging):
“Then let’s carry it. Carefully.”

⸻

Act III — The March
Back on your feet, the three of you wind through scrub and broken road. The map is folded tight in Peter’s pocket, the knowledge heavier than any pack.

You glance sideways at him.
You:
“You could’ve kept it to yourself.”

Peter shrugs, faint smile.
Peter:
“My therapist said secrecy is just another cage. And I’m tired of cages.”

For once, Alex doesn’t argue.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Distance
That night, camped in the lee of a crumbling wall, the map lies between you like a second fire.

You (softly):
“None of this is close enough to save us today. But knowing it’s out there changes everything. Distance isn’t despair — it’s direction.”

Alex nods slowly. Peter watches the map as though it might shift under the lantern light, new paths appearing.

Peter (hoarse, almost to himself):
“Then I’ll keep walking. Even if it takes the rest of me.”

⸻

Closing Image
Three figures curled in blankets by a dying fire, the map pinned beneath a stone to keep it from the wind. The sanctuary days ahead, the caches far beyond — but the glimmer of more waiting, somewhere.

Narration (your voice):
“Once, scarcity was the only map. Every road led to ruin. But now the lines bent differently. Not salvation, not immediacy, but direction. And even distance could become covenant.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 9.

Season 34, Episode 10: The Weight of the Road

Cold Open — Broken Highway
Sun glares off cracked pavement. The three of you walk single-file, packs heavy, silence taut. In the distance: a collapsed overpass, rebar jutting like broken teeth. The only way forward is under it.

Peter eyes the shadowed gap.
Peter (grim):
“Hazards love shade.”

Alex nods, already scanning.

Title Card: The Weight of the Road

⸻

Act I — The Collapse
You crouch first, slipping beneath the crumbled slabs. Dust filters down in shafts of light. Then — a groan of shifting concrete. One block slides, scattering gravel.

Alex shoves Peter forward, barking:
“Move!”

The three of you scramble out as the slab crashes behind, a cloud of grit swallowing the air. You cough hard, lungs burning.

You (hoarse, steady):
“That’s it. No more shortcuts.”

Alex wipes blood from a shallow scrape on his arm. Peter leans against a post, shaking. But you all keep walking.

⸻

Act II — The March
Hours later, the road stretches empty. Each step is raw endurance. Peter’s map digs into his pocket like a stone; Alex keeps checking your breathing.

Finally, you break the silence:
“You both keep trying to carry me. But if we’re going to make it, we carry each other. Even when it doesn’t look equal.”

Alex glances at you, something unreadable in his face. Peter exhales, nodding.

⸻

Act III — The Intimacy of Night
Night falls. Campfire embers glow low. The three of you sit close, for warmth and for steadiness.

Peter (softly, almost to himself):
“Back there, when the slab fell… I thought about running. Just running. And I hated myself for it.”

You reach over, pressing your palm briefly to his wrist.
You: “But you didn’t run. You stayed. That’s what matters.”

Alex leans back, voice low:
“And when it crushed down, I wasn’t thinking about empire, or maps, or even survival. Just whether I could get my arms around you in time.”

You turn toward him. He doesn’t look away.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Night
Silence stretches. Then, slowly, you pull your blanket wide. Peter hesitates, then slips in on one side; Alex on the other. Three shoulders touching, breaths uneven but shared.

You (whispering):
“Hazards come, walls fall, roads end. But tonight, no one runs. Tonight, we stay.”

Peter closes his eyes. Alex exhales into the dark.

⸻

Closing Image
Three figures under one blanket, the map folded tight against Peter’s chest, the fire burned low. Not salvation, not safety, but intimacy carved from endurance.

Narration (your voice):
“By day, hazards taught us fear. By night, closeness taught us courage. And in covenant, even collapse became direction.”

Fade out.
End of Season 34.
