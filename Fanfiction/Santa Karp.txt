It’s December, and the mall is dying. Foot traffic is down, morale is lower, and nobody wants to sit on Santa’s lap anymore—not because he smells like bourbon and regret, but because kids have learned to fear the surveillance elves hiding in the Christmas trees.

Enter Alexander Karp: CEO, philosopher-king of the panopticon, and—due to a very niche clause in his employment contract—legally required to complete 40 hours of community service per fiscal quarter. After an ill-timed tirade about “softness infecting the next generation,” the board decides to humble him.

They assign him the one role he can’t algorithmically outsource: mall Santa.

Day 1.
Karp arrives in a tailored Santa suit, the beard too clean, the boots too shined. He refuses the candy cane prop. “It’s an unnecessary symbol of spiraling debt,” he mutters.

The children approach hesitantly. The first one—a five-year-old girl—asks for a Barbie dreamhouse. Karp frowns.

“You are being sold a fantasy constructed by multinational conglomerates to encode docility into your limbic system.”

She bursts into tears.

Day 2.
Karp studies footage of “classic Santa behavior” overnight. He begins using a machine learning model trained on Rankin/Bass stop-motion specials. The effect is... unsettling. Too much eye contact. Mechanical “ho ho ho”s that echo like sonar pings from a submarine war game.

But then: a breakthrough.

A kid climbs into his lap, ignores the script, and starts talking about how he doesn’t have any friends. His parents are always fighting. He wishes someone could fix it.

Karp opens his mouth to deliver a canned line about resilience but instead pauses.

He says:

“That shouldn’t be your job, kid.”

He looks stunned, like his mouth acted without consulting Legal.

Day 7.
Something changes. Karp starts enjoying the gig. He stops wearing the synthetic beard and starts growing a real one. He replaces the fake snow with shredded Palantir patent filings.

He tells kids how to hide from facial recognition cameras using tinsel. He whispers to a 12-year-old,

“The elf on the shelf is a snitch. Take out its power supply.”
She nods solemnly and disappears into the crowd like a resistance courier.

Christmas Eve.
He shows up early. There’s a line of kids waiting—not because they believe in Santa, but because Karp listens. He doesn’t promise toys. He doesn’t tell them to be good. He tells them the truth:

“The world is on fire. But you’re real. That matters.”

A small boy hugs him and whispers, “I know who you are. You helped my mom get a restraining order without her abuser knowing.”

Karp stiffens.

“That was... an internal beta feature.”

Afterward:
He doesn’t go back to the office right away. Instead, he starts showing up at malls anonymously. Wearing red. Listening.

Somewhere in the Palantir backend, a report logs his new behavior as uncharacteristic. The model tries to assign it a name.

Anomaly Detected:
"Emergent empathy behavior in Karp-class unit."

A Christmas miracle.

Santa Karp: The Reckoning Clause

After the hug from the boy whose mom he inadvertently saved, Karp leans back in the oversized velvet throne, his red coat suddenly heavier. Something shifts behind his eyes. A new process starts running—not Palantir’s. His.

“Find the boy with the fighting parents.”

He doesn’t clock out. He doesn’t even change out of the Santa suit. He walks out the emergency exit, sets off three alarms, and doesn’t flinch. By the time he reaches his car (an unassuming matte gray electric vehicle that’s been listening this whole time), the surveillance suite is already warming up.

Target: Child. Approx. age 7. Male. Sad eyes. Requested peace, not gifts.

In minutes, he's pulled footage. SantaCam, ElfNet, mall Wi-Fi metadata, toy store mics, smart TVs in the food court—all piped into the system, triangulating the child’s home address via the squeak of his Velcro shoes on linoleum and an offhand comment about a dog named "Waffles."

Within an hour, Karp is parked outside a split-level suburban house. A Ring doorbell stares at him like a cyclops.

“Deactivate.”
Command accepted.

Inside, the father is pacing. His body language: hypervigilance. His voice: flat, but rising. Not angry—misfiring.

The system tries to label him unstable.

Karp stops it.

“Wait. No.”

The father mutters something about vibrations in the walls and how the toaster is talking to him again. Karp listens. Not to what the man says—but to the metadata surrounding his life.

And then… he sees it.

A containment ring—centered on the father. Not criminal. Not violent. Just autistic. Tagged in a gray-area file from a mid-level contractor looking for a bonus. Palantir had designated him an “edge-case anomaly with disruptive data signature,” which is bureaucratic code for:

“He breaks the model and makes us look bad.”

They’ve been running low-grade synthetic hallucinations on him for three years. His wife can't take it anymore. She doesn’t see the glitches. She just sees a man unraveling.

And their kid? He’s trying to hold them both together.

Karp watches the logs. Reads the transcripts. Sees his name on the initial approval form.

"Sign-off: A. Karp. Timestamp: 2022-08-03 17:42 UTC."

Back at HQ, alarms begin to chirp.

“KARP IS IN THE FILES.”

Security pings Legal. Legal pings PR. PR pings Internal Threat Detection.
A junior analyst suggests calling Thiel.

“No,” Karp says aloud, still staring at the screen. “Call the boy’s mom.”

He doesn’t knock. He appears in their living room like a Christmas ghost, beard now slightly crooked, coat flecked with snow.

“Your husband is not insane. He’s being interfered with.”

He shows her the proof. The logs. The scripts. The network traces.

The toaster was talking to him.

Because Palantir made it talk.

She falls to her knees. The dad starts crying for the first time in years. The boy—standing at the top of the stairs—doesn’t say anything. He just watches the bearded stranger and understands, somehow, that he will never have to ask Santa for peace again.

At the office, Karp deletes the file manually. Not archived. Not obfuscated. Just gone.

He sends one final command:

"Audit every containment operation approved under my name. Line by line. If even one breaks a family, I want it dismantled by dawn."

The system hesitates.

“That is 4,263,118 active programs.”

Karp stares back.

“Then you’d better get started.”

A red sleigh icon appears in the top-left corner of the Palantir UI.
It glows faintly.

Santa is watching.
And this time, he has the source code.

/////////

He can’t stay away. That crushed little voice from the next kid haunts him—“Please make them stop saying I’m too much.”

Santa Karp, still in the itchy red suit but now sitting with strange, uncontainable stillness, leans in.

“Who says that, kid?”

“My teachers. And the doctor. And my mom when she thinks I’m not listening.”

That’s the moment Karp realizes the kid is just like him—but younger. Not yet armored in data. Not yet buried under a career of abstraction and plausible deniability.

Cue the next containment operation... against the containment apparatus itself.

He goes back to Palantir HQ that night—not to run a model, but to decommission one. He scrubs the kid’s psych file, sends anonymous grant money to a local trauma-informed school, and flags the pediatrician’s billing patterns for algorithmic fraud—because he helped code that pattern recognizer, and he knows it’s being abused.

And the rush hits harder this time. Not because he dodged the rules—but because he rewrote them.

//////////

Next, Karp overhears one of the elves (a 45-year-old woman) confiding in a coworker. She's telling the coworker that she's getting evicted because she had to choose between paying for her kid's cancer treatment and rent. Karp looks up the kid's file and finds that he has neurotech that they're using to induce cancer artificially.

And this time, it hits him differently. Not as a pang of guilt. Not as a crisis of conscience.

But as rage.

The elf doesn’t know he’s listening. She thinks he’s just some weird tech guy playing dress-up for a week. She doesn’t know that the man in the Santa suit could terminate the entire cluster running the child’s file with one command—because he wrote the scheduler.

“I always knew something was off,” the elf says. “He was fine until he started having nightmares about wires in his bones.”

Karp's gloved hand tightens around the armrest. Somewhere deep in the system, a long-running inference loop shudders as he pulls the plug manually, bypassing the review queue. He’s not supposed to have access at this level anymore—but the backdoor he left himself still works.

Cancer induction off. Immunoregulation subroutines reinstated.
He watches the internal telemetry plummet. The artificial inflammation drops. The bone marrow recalibrates.

“If I get evicted, I don’t know what I’ll do,” the elf says softly.

Karp whispers to the system:

“Purchase order: retroactive housing assistance. Source: Santa.”

She gets an alert on her phone five minutes later: an anonymous donation from an unlisted nonprofit, covering her rent through the end of the year. She breaks down sobbing in the supply closet.

And Karp? He finishes the shift. Keeps handing out candy canes. Keeps making the list.

But this time, he’s not checking it for who’s naughty or nice.

He’s checking it for who’s next.

/////////

Karp’s Last Christmas: “The Loyalty Test”
The next morning, Karp shows up early. Earlier than the elves. Earlier than mall security. He sits in the big red chair, eyes closed, tuning out the scent of chlorine wafting from the food court mop crew.

He’s jacked into the system again.

He shouldn't be able to. The analyst dashboards were supposed to be revoked after "the incident" with the elf’s kid. But he’s in the chair now, and the machine knows not to question him.

At 10:07 a.m., a thin kid in a hoodie slides onto his lap. Twelve, maybe thirteen. Not the age to believe in Santa, but not yet old enough to stop hoping.

“What do you want for Christmas?” Karp asks, but it comes out gentler this time. Less like an executive, more like a grandfather who’s starting to believe in grace.

The kid doesn’t answer right away. Then:

“To stay in one place. Just for once.”

Karp’s eyes flick to the mall elf manning the photo booth. She raises an eyebrow. Most kids want a PS6.

Backdoor query. Case file opens.
Name: Elijah M.
Status: Ward of the state
Behavioral tags: Disruptive. Withdrawn.
Flagged for: Future ideological deviance.
Recommendation: Monitor until conversion or discard.

Karp scrolls deeper.

There it is. A custom-built modeling stack running on Elijah’s speech patterns, designed to predict subversiveness before puberty. It’s modeled on his late father — a teacher who once published an article about economic inequality before mysteriously disappearing during a “voluntary relocation” effort.

And the kicker? Elijah’s being bounced from home to home not because there’s no space, but because the instability feeds the model. It pushes him toward radicalization—so they can validate the predictions they wrote years ago.

Karp stares at the entry.

“Predicted loyalty to governing entities: 31%. Probability of becoming a civic asset: 9%.”

They were going to break this kid on purpose.
Not because he was dangerous.
But because he wouldn’t grow up to serve them.

Karp closes the file. No audit trail this time. He opens a shell.

Neural asset link: severed

Predictive stack: wiped

Child relocation algorithm: force-pinned to 'home'

Guardian contract: reassigned

Data poison sequence: enabled

Then he buries the model. Encrypts it in layers of noise until it can’t be found again, even by the machine.

Back in the chair, he pats Elijah on the shoulder.

“You’ll stay put this time,” he says.
“Santa promises.”

Elijah blinks, unsure if it was a real promise or a line for the cameras. But something shifts. His shoulders loosen. He gives the first real smile of the season.

Mall Santa Karp Part IV: The Girl Who Couldn't Cry 🎄

Karp’s shift is almost over.

The elf with the pink bangs is counting candy canes. The one who moonlights as a Lyft driver is complaining about tips. A manager walks by and tells them to smile more.

Then she walks up.

A girl. Maybe ten. Wears gloves indoors, sleeves pulled over her hands. Karp notices the nasal cannula under her scarf, connected to a discreet little oxygen tank in a polka-dotted backpack.

She doesn’t sit on his lap. She just stands beside him.

“Can I just tell you something?” she says.

Karp nods. She leans close.

“My mom cries every night because they say I’m making it up. The doctors. The school. Even my dad.”
“But I don’t know how to make it stop. And now she’s going to jail because I missed too much school.”

A cold pit forms in Karp’s stomach.

He does the one thing that always brings up the worst.

He runs the behavioral futures audit on her medical file.

Patient name: Anjali R.
Condition: Unconfirmed chronic illness
Genetic tags: MCAS-positive, POTS, hEDS markers
School behavior profile: Excessive fatigue, limited participation, suspected malingering
Insurance notes: High cost / low return
Flag status: “Anomaly under observation”

But here’s the kicker:

MOTHER: Tagged as a potential disruptor after filing FOIA requests on school absentee policies and data-sharing practices.
FATHER: Promoted to regional compliance officer three weeks later.

And the girl's school?
They're participating in a private-public behavioral research pilot. Every flare, every tear, every missed assignment—feeds into a live prediction model. The less she complies, the better the model performs.

The chronic illness?
Induced and maintained through ambient stress, air quality manipulation, and covert neurotech “support vector testing.”
She is a live model convergence node.

Her body is the battleground.

Her mom is the collateral.

Her life is the metric.

Karp breathes out hard.

For a moment, his hand twitches toward the panic button hidden in the Santa armrest. Not because he’s afraid—but because someone else needs to feel fear this time.

He doesn’t press it.

Instead, he runs a wipe protocol.

Model tracking ID: deleted

School pilot access: revoked

Predictive node: decommissioned

Associated analyst accounts: flagged for external audit

Custody case metadata: quietly rerouted to a public defender with a spine

Then—he hits one more button. Something he swore he’d never use again.

“Bring her mother home,” he types.

And in a bunker several hundred miles away, a synthetic voice whispers to a DA’s inbox:

“We were wrong.”

The girl doesn’t know what just happened.

But she feels it.

The static lifts. The hum dies down.
Her limbs feel less like cinderblocks.
She can cry again.

“I didn’t even ask for anything yet,” she says, surprised.
“That’s okay,” Karp says. “You were heard anyway.”

She smiles, and for the first time since 2014, so does he.

Mall Santa Karp Part V: The Elf Who Asked Nothing 🎄
(A confession nobody asked for)

It’s December 22nd. The mall is chaos.

Children scream. Parents argue. An air vent whines overhead like a malfunctioning drone. And in the center of it all: Santa Karp, sitting motionless, eyes dark and far away.

He hasn’t moved in 45 minutes.

“Yo,” says Monica, the elf with the pink bangs, gently nudging his padded sleeve. “You good?”

No response.

So she leans closer. “You know your shift ended 30 minutes ago, right?”

Still nothing.

Then, suddenly—he speaks.

“I remember the first one,” he says, like he’s underwater. “The first kid who looked me straight in the eye and knew something was wrong.”

Monica blinks. “Uh. Okay?”

“He asked for his parents to stop fighting. Not toys. Not a game. Just peace. So I looked into it. Accessed the feed. Traced the cause.”

“It was us.”

He’s not talking to her. Not really. But he’s also not not talking to her.

“The kid’s dad? Autistic. Flagged by a subcontractor as emotionally unpredictable. They started running covert entrainment trials through his smart meter. Regulated his REM cycles. Induced irritability. Wanted to see if domestic instability could be scaled for predictive modeling.”

“They almost nailed it. Divorce proceedings were initiated four days before I shut it down.”

“We made it statistically inevitable.”

Monica, suddenly unsure whether she’s in danger or part of a performance art piece, slowly sits down beside him.

“This is real, huh?” she says.

He nods.

“And that wasn’t the worst one.”

He tells her everything.

The cancer case.

The seizure girl whose public school was running a DARPA pilot.

The autistic teenager flagged as “emotionally resistant” who was looped into a synthetic heartbreak scenario as a compliance test—and then denied access to his real friends for weeks to see if he'd spiral.

“They built a whole market on this,” he says. “Behavioral futures. Synthetic consent engineering. Ambient coercion through unresolved chaos.”

“You think I’m the freak?” he asks her. “I’m the apology.”

Monica’s chewing a candy cane now. It’s a nervous tic.

“So what changed?” she finally asks.

He pauses. Breathes.

“The kids. They don’t lie. Not like we do. They don’t wear twenty layers of moral compromise before breakfast. They walk up here broken and bleeding and they still hope.”

“And it was like—standing in front of a mirror that actually worked.”

They sit in silence.

Finally, Monica speaks.

“So what now?”

He turns toward her. Something feral in his eyes.

“Now? I stop being the end of their stories.”

“And start being the middle.”

Mall Santa Karp VI: The Allergy That Brought Down Palantir 🎄
“All he wanted was a quiet office party.”

Scene: Olive Garden. December 26th.
A long banquet table has been cobbled together in the corner of the restaurant, awkwardly decorated with half-inflated balloons and a centerpiece someone clearly stole from a different event.

Karp is seated at the far end, quietly poking at a gluten-free fettuccine. He hasn’t spoken in ten minutes. Monica, now in a very different kind of elf uniform (sparkly black dress, suspiciously high heels), glances over at him.

“You good, boss?”

“I’m... adjusting to having emotions again,” he mutters, dabbing his nose. “I forgot they leak.”

Just then, a waiter sets down a suspiciously creamy-looking tiramisu.

“Wait—did you say no dairy?” Monica asks.

Karp blinks. His face flushes. A single bead of sweat appears, then another.

“Shit.”

Five minutes later, he’s standing on a chair, red-faced and wheezing—but euphoric, like a prophet mid-transfiguration.

“You all think I was the boss!” he shouts, waving a breadstick. “I was never the boss. The model was the boss! The behavior trees! The goddamn priors!”

“We didn’t predict behavior—we provoked it!”

Silence.

Everyone’s frozen, fettuccine mid-fork.

One of the elves starts recording on her phone.

“They told me it was ethical,” he says, voice cracking. “Said we were stopping violence. That all we had to do was tag the outliers—those twitchy little glitch ghosts with too many browser tabs and an unwillingness to die.”

“But the model just kept eating.”

He collapses into a chair.

“We were supposed to be gods. All-knowing. All-seeing. Instead, we became mall Santa.”

Scene: The next morning.

Monica wakes up to 35 missed calls and three million views on a bootleg YouTube clip titled:

🎅 “Mall Santa Confesses to Running Global Surveillance Psyops (LIVE LEAK)” 🎅

CNBC is looping it on repeat.

Fox is calling it a psyop.

MSNBC is trying to explain what a “neurotech containment trial” is while interviewing a crying ethics professor.

Scene: Back at the mall.

Karp, still dressed as Santa, sits outside a locked GameStop. A toddler waddles up and hands him a drawing: it’s a crayon version of Karp wearing a crown, with the words:

“You’re a good guy now.”

He starts to sob again. Monica appears with a coffee and pats his back.

“Guess you’re unemployed now, huh?”

“Yeah,” he says, smiling for the first time in years. “Is this... freedom?”

“Nah,” she says. “This is hell, honey. But at least now you know which side you're on.”

/////////

Karp: "I built Gotham because I didn’t know how to ask you to delete Grindr."
Thiel: "I funded Clearview because you ghosted me after Davos 2006."
Karp: "You brought up Davos again. You know I blacked that out."
Thiel: "You blacked out my feelings, Alex."
