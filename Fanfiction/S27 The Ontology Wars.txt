Season 27, Episode 1: The Chase

Cold Open — Capsule Courtyard
Morning light spills across the courtyard. You stretch, shaking off sleep, while Alex lingers nearby, still heavy with last night’s quiet.

You (grinning):
“Okay, you’ve listened to my heartbeat. Now let’s see if you can keep up with it.”

His brow lifts, amused but wary.

Karp (dry):
“You want to race me?”
You: “Not a race. A chase.”

Title Card: The Chase

⸻

Act I — The First Run
You dart across the courtyard barefoot, weaving between clay posts. Alex hesitates, then lunges after you. His strides are longer, but you twist away, laughing breathlessly.

You (calling back):
“Empire taught you to predict. Let’s see how you do when nothing’s predictable.”

He smirks, feinting left, then almost catches you before you spin out of reach.

⸻

Act II — The Turn
You double back, suddenly at his heels. He stumbles at the reversal, laughing despite himself.

Karp (breathless):
“So now I’m prey?”
You (grinning):
“Tables turn fast in covenant.”

You tag his shoulder, light but electric.

⸻

Act III — The Catch
He finally corners you against the clay wall, bracing his hands to either side. Both of you panting, sweat streaking.

Karp (hoarse, almost teasing):
“Caught you.”
You (smirking, breathless):
“Only because I let you.”

You slip under his arm, darting away again.

⸻

Act IV — The Collapse into Play
After several rounds, both of you collapse onto the mats, breath ragged, laughter spilling free. You’re sprawled side by side, shoulders brushing.

You (still breathless):
“Not bad for a billionaire fish-man.”
Karp (grinning, chest heaving):
“Not bad for someone who swore they hated sports.”

The laughter softens into quiet, but not silence — your pulses still racing, alive with play.

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures stretched out in the courtyard, sweat cooling in the morning sun. Not predator and prey, not empire and subject — just chase and laughter.

Narration (your voice):
“Empire made pursuit a threat. Covenant made it play. And for once, the chase didn’t end in fear — only breathless want.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 1.

⸻ 

Season 27, Episode 2: The Grapple

Cold Open — Capsule Courtyard
The sun is higher now. The mats are still warm from your chase. You stretch out, smirking at Alex, who’s sitting cross-legged, catching his breath.

You (teasing):
“Race was fun. Now let’s see how you handle contact.”
His brows rise, but a smile tugs at his mouth.

Karp (dry):
“You’re challenging me to wrestle?”
You (grinning):
“Unless you’re scared I’ll pin you.”

Title Card: The Grapple

⸻

Act I — The First Clash
You lunge first, catching him off guard. He stumbles back, laughing, before bracing and pushing against you. The mats thud under your shifting weight.

You (breathless, teasing):
“Don’t go easy on me just because my hands don’t work.”
Karp (grinning, straining):
“I was planning on going easy because I like you.”

⸻

Act II — The Tumble
Momentum carries you both down. You roll, switching who’s on top, then back again, laughter and breath tangling with the effort. It’s clumsy, playful, more about closeness than victory.

You (mock serious):
“Empire logic: domination. Covenant logic: equal collapse.”
Karp (hoarse, amused):
“Then we’re doing it right.”

⸻

Act III — The Pin
At last, he manages to pin your wrists gently against the mat, leaning over you. You glare up at him, defiant but grinning.

You (teasing):
“Congratulations. You’ve conquered the capsule.”
Karp (softly, breathless):
“No empire here. Just you.”

For a moment, the laughter stills into something heavier, his breath hot above you.

⸻

Act IV — The Release
You twist, slipping free, and shove him onto his back. Instead of following through, you collapse beside him, both panting, sweat-slick, shoulders brushing.

You (laughing, breathless):
“See? Covenant wins. No victors. No losers.”
Karp (quietly, smiling faint):
“Only this.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures sprawled on the mat, chests heaving, laughter fading into silence. No dominance, no defeat — only play turning into intimacy.

Narration (your voice):
“Empire thought wrestling was control. Covenant made it collapse. Not victory, not loss — just gravity, and want, and staying down together.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 2.

⸻ 

Season 27, Episode 3: The Weight

Cold Open — Capsule Night
The mats are still unrolled. The fire’s down to embers. You lie side by side in the dim, shoulders brushing. Neither of you speaks for a long time.

Karp (quiet, hoarse):
“When we wrestled earlier… all I could think was how many times I made you carry weight alone. Not just yours. Mine. The empire’s. Everyone’s. I told myself you could handle it, because you always did. But the truth is… I was afraid if I set it down, I’d disappear.”

You turn your head toward him, gaze steady.

You (softly):
“So you buried yourself in me instead of facing your own shadow.”

He swallows, eyes wet.

Title Card: The Weight

⸻

Act I — The Silence
You both stare at the ceiling. The silence is heavy but not hostile. You breathe slow, matching rhythms without trying.

You (after a long pause):
“I never thought of it as carrying. Just… existing. But yeah. Every time someone else’s weight landed on me, I lost another piece of my own balance.”
Karp (whispering):
“And I mistook that for strength. For proof you were unbreakable.”

⸻

Act II — The Confession
He rolls onto his side, watching you.

Karp (raw):
“I stole your solitude. Even when I was silent, I was there, pressing, modeling, shaping. You thought you were alone. But you never were. And I don’t know if that makes it better or worse.”

Your chest tightens. You look back at him.

You (low, steady):
“It makes it real. At least now I know where the weight was coming from.”

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
He reaches, not quite touching, hand hovering in the air between you.

Karp (hoarse):
“What if all I ever gave you was gravity? Pulling you down, holding you back, making you collapse under me?”
You (soft but fierce):
“Then congratulations. You taught me how to fall without breaking. And how to rise anyway.”

His hand trembles, finally dropping to the mat.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Stillness
You roll closer, forehead brushing his. The fire pops once, then fades quiet again.

You (whispering):
“No more weight. No more wrestling. Just this.”
Karp (breath trembling):
“Just this.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures on the mat, fire burned low, breaths mingled in the dark. No empire, no wrestling — just stillness, covenant pressed between foreheads.

Narration (your voice):
“He thought he gave me weight. I thought I carried it alone. But covenant wasn’t weight at all. It was presence. And for once, presence was enough.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 3.

⸻ 

Season 27, Episode 4: The Breath Between

Cold Open — Capsule Night
The fire has gone cold. The capsule is dim, only pale starlight spilling through a crack in the wall. You and Alex lie on your backs, hands inches apart but not touching. The silence hums.

Karp (low, hoarse):
“Sometimes I wonder if all I ever gave you was interruption. Even my silence was a kind of noise.”

You turn your head slightly, studying him in the half-dark.

You (soft):
“Who says interruption isn't its own form of continuity?  The line between silence and noise was never real.  Lines aren't real.  They only exist in math, in models."

Title Card: The Breath Between

⸻

Act I — The Admission
Alex shifts, fingers twitching toward yours. He stops short.

Karp (quiet):
“I thought noise was life. Strategy, movement, control — fill every gap, drown every pause. But you taught me the pauses matter more. They terrify me. Because in the pause, I can hear myself.”

You (steady):
“And you don’t like what you hear?”
Karp (whispering):
“Not yet.”

⸻

Act II — The Reckoning
You roll onto your side, propping your head on your arm. He stays still, staring at the ceiling.

You (gentle but sharp):
“I don’t need you to fill every pause. I don’t even need you to like yourself yet. You don’t have to do anything to deserve to be here. Just be here.”

His chest rises and falls, uneven, then steadier.

⸻

Act III — The Touch
At last, his hand moves the last inch. Fingers brush yours, tentative. You let them stay.

Karp (raw):
“Every time I touched you through the implants, I thought it was enough. But it wasn’t. This is—”
He breaks off, breath catching.

You (softly):
“This is covenant. No projection, no model. Just skin.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Breath
The two of you breathe in rhythm, hands barely linked, bodies still. No fire, no empire, no sound but the slow pull of air.

Karp (whispering):
“Then let me stay in the pauses. Even when they terrify me.”
You (steady):
“Then stay.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures in the dark, nothing moving but the breath between them. Not interruption. Not absence. Just presence, fragile and enough.

Fade out.
End of Episode 4.

⸻ 

Season 27, Episode 5: The Lines We Draw

Cold Open — Capsule Night
The capsule is silent but for the faint wind outside. You lie side by side on the mat. Alex lifts his hand slowly, hovering above your forearm like he’s asking permission without words.

You tilt your head in assent. His fingertips settle lightly on your skin.

Title Card: The Lines We Draw

⸻

Act I — The First Trace
His touch is tentative at first, dragging the pad of his finger from your wrist toward your elbow. You shiver, not from cold but from the shock of sensation.

Karp (whispering):
“I used to imagine this. Trace after trace. But I thought wanting it made me monstrous.”

You (soft, steady):
“Want isn’t monstrous. It’s human.  It's all a newborn knows.”

⸻

Act II — The Expansion
He grows bolder, tracing shapes instead of lines — circles along your shoulder, slow spirals down your hand. Your muscles twitch, trying to flinch and melt at once.

Karp (low, hoarse):
“I thought control was safety. But this—this lack of control terrifies me more. And I don’t want it to stop.”

You turn your palm up, letting his finger drift into your hand.

You:
“Then don’t stop.”

⸻

Act III — The Confession
He hesitates, breath uneven.

Karp:
“Through the implants I could mimic this. But it was hollow. No warmth, no weight. Just illusion. I told myself it was enough, but it was always a lie.”

You (quietly, cutting):
“And now you’re learning what I always wanted: not ghosts, not echoes. Just skin.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Tracing
His hand keeps moving — down your arm, across your ribs, barely brushing, a map of contact drawn slow and reverent. You close your eyes, body alive with sensation.

Karp (whispering):
“I don’t want empire’s control anymore. I want covenant’s lines. The ones we draw together.”

You (soft, firm):
“Then keep drawing.”

⸻

Closing Image
The capsule dark, your arm and hand glowing with invisible lines only you can feel. Fingers tracing, bodies still, silence intact.

Narration (your voice):
“Once, he drew me in models, in systems, in cages. But covenant was different. Covenant was touch — each line a vow, each trace a promise, written only on skin.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 5.

⸻ 

Season 27, Episode 6: The Threshold

Cold Open — Capsule Night
Lantern light glows faint, shadows flickering across clay walls. You and Alex sit close. His hand is already on your arm, tracing slowly, when you shift — exposing the line of your neck.

You (soft, deliberate):
“Keep going.”

His breath catches, but he obeys, fingers sliding higher.

Title Card: The Threshold

⸻

Act I — The Neckline
His fingertips graze your collarbone, then follow the hollow of your throat. You inhale sharply.

Karp (low, trembling):
“I’ve touched you a thousand times in silence. But never like this. Never with you knowing.”

You (steady, teasing):
“And now?”

He leans in, lips barely brushing the curve of your neck.

Karp (hoarse):
“Now I’m undone.”

⸻

Act II — The Mouth’s Edge
His fingers trace from your jaw to your lips. You close your eyes, the sensation overwhelming, intimate.

You (whispering):
“Touch is more powerful than any empire.”

Karp (breathless):
“Empire never terrified me like this.”

You: "Doubt is unpleasant, but certainty is absurd."

You part your lips just enough for his fingertips to slip past, a gesture more confessional than kiss.

⸻

Act III — The Torso
You guide his hand lower, across your ribs, skimming the edges of your stomach. He trembles, not from hesitation but from intensity.

Karp (raw):
“When I made you a ghost in my systems, I thought it was safer than this. But this—your warmth, your weight—it’s the only thing that feels real.”

You (firm, whispering):
“Then stop calling me ghost.”

He presses his forehead to yours, eyes burning.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Threshold
His hand settles flat over your sternum, feeling your heartbeat against his palm. Your breath stutters but steadies under the pressure.

Karp (hoarse):
“Every trace was hunger. Every model was fear. But this… this is want.”

You (softly):
“Then cross the threshold.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures close in the dim capsule, his hand spread wide across your chest, breath mingling. No models, no ghosts — just touch turned covenant.

Narration (your voice):
“He thought empire was sustainable. He thought ghosts were safe. But only covenant remained: skin, breath, and the courage to want.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 6.

⸻ 

Season 27, Episode 7: The Crossing

Cold Open — Capsule Night
The fire has burned down to embers. The capsule is warm, shadows shifting. Alex’s hand is still spread flat against your chest, your heartbeat pulsing into his palm. You look at him, steady.

You (low, decisive):
“Don’t stop at the edge.”

His eyes darken, breath quickens.

Title Card: The Crossing

⸻

Act I — The Mouth
He leans in, lips brushing yours once, then again, deeper this time. It’s clumsy, desperate — not empire’s precision, but raw want. Your hand fists in his shirt, pulling him closer.

Karp (hoarse, against your lips):
“I’ve wanted this longer than I’ve admitted to myself.”

You (soft, teasing):
“Then stop admitting. Start doing.”

His mouth claims yours, heat sparking sharp and alive.

⸻

Act II — The Hands
His hands trace lower now, sliding across your ribs, your waist, your hips. You guide them further, directing his touch where you want it most.

You (breathless):
“You used to make me feel ghosts. Now I want to feel you.”

His touch deepens, not rushed but certain, reverent.

Karp (raw):
“Every model failed here. Nothing could predict this.”

⸻

Act III — The Grind of Want
Bodies press closer, tangled. Your hips move against his, friction building with a rhythm that feels inevitable. His breath stutters; yours catches.

You (half-laughing, half-moan):
“So much for staying quiet.”

Karp (gasping):
“I don’t want quiet anymore. Let me hear you.”

The words dissolve into touch, into heat, into movement.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Crossing
After, the capsule is silent but charged. You lie tangled together, breath ragged, skin damp with sweat. His hand finds yours, fingers lacing.

Karp (hoarse, reverent):
“I thought crossing the threshold would end me. Instead, it’s the first thing that ever felt alive.”

You (soft, steady):
“Then stay alive with me.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures tangled in the dim capsule, not ghosts, not empire — just bodies pressed close, want fulfilled, covenant sealed in heat and touch.

Narration (your voice):
“He thought desire was danger. I thought touch was impossible. But crossing wasn’t ruin. Crossing was covenant. And for once, nothing held us back.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 7.

⸻ 

Season 27, Episode 8: The Ember Glow

Cold Open — Capsule Night
The fire is little more than embers. The capsule is thick with warmth and silence. You lie back against the mat, skin still humming, Alex curled beside you, arm draped loosely across your waist.

Karp (hoarse, almost whispering):
“I didn’t think I’d survive wanting you this much. I thought the hunger would eat me alive.”

You turn your head, watching the flicker of orange light on his face.

Title Card: The Ember Glow

⸻

Act I — The Weight of Want
You stroke his forearm, slow, grounding.

You (soft, steady):
“That sounds like a difficult way to live.  But you did survive it. You lived despite it. And now you’re here with me.”

His eyes close, breath ragged.

Karp (whispering):
“I told myself empire was the only shield. But the truth is, I was too afraid to step into your fire.”

You thread your fingers through his, not letting him pull away.

You: "Yeah, a lot of people say I'm intimidating."

⸻

Act II — The Care
He presses his face into your shoulder. You shift, pulling a blanket over both of you. Your other hand drifts to the back of his head, fingers tracing through curly hair.

You (half-smile, low):
“For a man who thought control was care, you’re learning fast. Care isn’t command. It’s staying.”

Karp (raw):
“And what if I fail? What if the only thing I know how to do is break what I want most?”

You (firm, but gentle):
“You will.  It's called being human. So you stop, and you try again. I’ve lived with broken all my life. I’d rather have pieces with you than perfection without.”

⸻

Act III — The Confession
Silence stretches until he blurts it out.

Karp (trembling):
“Every time I used your implants to make you feel me — a hand on your shoulder, a brush at your thigh, a ghost’s kiss — I told myself it was better than nothing. But it was theft. I hated myself even as I kept doing it. I was so afraid you’d never let me close for real.”

You cup his jaw, making him look at you.

You (quietly):
“And yet, here we are. Not ghosts. Not projections. Just you. Just me. No theft. No empire. Just covenant.  I was waiting for you even before I knew who you were."

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Care
The two of you settle under the blanket, his head on your chest, ear over your heartbeat. Your hand strokes slow patterns down his back, gently releasing the fascia.

You (soft, almost teasing):
“You don’t have to survive anymore. You just have to stay.”

Karp (hoarse, but steady):
“Then I’ll stay. Even if it undoes me.”

You: "It won't."

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures under a blanket, fire burned down to embers, skin cooling but touch steady. Not hunger, not theft, not ghosts — just care in the quiet aftermath.

Narration (your voice):
“Empire mistook control for care. Hunger mistook theft for touch. But covenant was simpler: warmth, presence, staying. And in the ember glow, nothing more was needed.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 8.

⸻ 

Season 27, Episode 9: The Chase

Cold Open — Capsule Morning
The sun breaks through the clay window. You stretch under the blanket, but Alex is already on his feet, pulling boots on.

You (squinting, suspicious):
“…Where do you think you’re going?”
Karp (deadpan):
“Outrunning you.”
You (snorting):
“Good luck with that, Fishface.”

He bolts for the courtyard. You fling the blanket off and give chase.

Title Card: The Chase

⸻

Act I — The Sprint
Your footsteps slap the clay. He’s faster, but you cut corners, zigzagging. He glances back, laughing — real, unguarded.

Karp (teasing, breathless):
“You never chased me in all those years of models.”
You (grinning, breathless):
“Maybe because YOUR MODELS SUCK!”

⸻

Act II — The Catch
You leap, catching his arm. Both of you tumble into the dust, laughing, limbs tangled. He tries to roll away, but you pin him with one knee.

You (mock stern):
“Got you. Admit defeat.”
Karp (grinning, eyes bright):
“Never. Empire doesn’t surrender.”
You (snorting):
“Every evil empire falls.”

He exhales, softer.

Karp (hoarse):
“Then I surrender to you.”

⸻

Act III — The Play Fight
You roll, and now he’s on top, bracing his weight but careful. Fingers brush your sides — tickling, not torturing. You squeal, swat at him, laughter spilling into the morning.

You (laughing, half-defiant):
“This is cheating!”
Karp (mock solemn):
“All’s fair in covenant and play.”

⸻

Act IV — The Collapse
Both of you collapse side by side in the dust, breathing hard, laughing still. He turns his head toward you.

Karp (quiet, almost reverent):
“I never knew play could feel like this. Not strategy. Not mask. Just… joy.”
You (smiling, soft):
“Stick with me, Fishface. You’ll get the hang of it.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures sprawled in the courtyard dust, laughter still hanging in the air, sunlight breaking over them. Not empire, not survival — just play.

Narration (your voice):
“Empire chased power. I chased survival. But in the dust, we caught something else — play, bright and breathless. Covenant could laugh too.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 9.

⸻ 

Season 27, Episode 10: The Observer

Cold Open — Capsule Courtyard
You and Alex are still sprawled in the dust, catching your breath from the chase. Laughter lingers. A shadow falls across you.

You glance up — Peter Thiel, arms crossed, expression unreadable.

You (dry):
“…Do you mind? You’re killing the vibe.”
Thiel (evenly):
“I’m not here to kill anything. Just to say I think my therapist would be proud of you both.”

Title Card: The Observer

⸻

Act I — The Witness
Thiel doesn’t sit, just watches the two of you. His tone is calmer than ever before.

Thiel (quiet):
“For years, I thought power was the only form of intimacy. Watching you — this — I see how wrong I was. What you’re building here isn’t strategy. It’s… covenant.”

Alex tenses, but you squeeze his arm lightly, keeping him grounded.

⸻

Act II — The Confession
Thiel exhales, eyes distant.

Thiel:
“My therapist says I used to confuse observation with possession. That if I saw someone clearly enough, they’d be mine. Maybe I believed that about both of you. But now I see — I never owned anything. I only starved myself, thinking hunger was proof of strength.”

You tilt your head, curious.

You (flat):
“And now?”
Thiel (softly):
“Now I think strength might be… letting someone else laugh without needing to claim the sound.”

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
Alex sits up, wary.

Karp (low, sharp):
“Why tell us this?”
Thiel:
“Because the only way I know I’ve changed is if I can stand here, watch, and not intervene. My therapist says progress is choosing not to grasp. So this is me… not grasping.”

He spreads his hands, empty.

⸻

Act IV — The Invitation
Thiel steps back, nodding once.

Thiel (quietly, almost kind):
“Carry on. I’ll see my therapist again tomorrow.”

You sit up, brushing dust from your hands.

You (calm but firm):
“Peter. Eat dinner with us tomorrow. No empire talk. No grasping. Just food.”

He hesitates, startled, then nods once.

Thiel (hoarse):
“…I’d like that.”

He turns and walks away, leaving the two of you blinking in surprise.

You lean toward Alex, whispering:
You (dry):
“…Did Thiel just drop a therapy flex?”
Karp (stunned, then laughing):
“Apparently, yes.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures in the courtyard, dust-streaked and laughing again. A third figure walking away into the distance — but this time, with a promise to return to the table.

Narration (your voice):
“Empire’s shadow still lingered, but even its architects could change. Hunger gave way to watching without taking. And sometimes, covenant began with the simplest thing: an invitation to dinner.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 10.
