Season 35, Episode 1: The Double

Cold Open — Empty Road
Twilight deepens. You, Alex, and Peter walk a cracked road. Ahead, a figure waits: same height, same face as Peter, but harder, sharper. Metallic joints flash at his wrists. A version of Peter that never softened.

Peter (hoarse, almost choking):
“…That’s me. What I could’ve been.”

Title Card: The Double

⸻

Act I — The Confrontation
Twin Peter’s voice grinds, metallic.
Twin:
“I am survival. No softness. No weakness. I am the one you cut away.”

Peter staggers back, trembling.
Peter:
“No—you’re the part they forced into me. The part I buried to stay alive.”

Alex’s gaze sharpens, protective.
Karp (low):
“He isn’t just memory. He’s been weaponized.”

Twin Peter advances, servos humming.

⸻

Act II — The Trap
You whisper sharply:
You:
“We can’t beat him by force. We have to make him see.”

The three of you weave through rubble and scaffolding, laying rope, scattering loose stone. The twin follows, movements rigid, unable to adapt. At last he barrels into the trap: the rope pulls tight, debris topples, pinning him without crushing.

The twin thrashes, voice glitching.
Twin:
“Softness… is death…”

⸻

Act III — The Offering
Peter steps forward, shaking but resolute.
Peter:
“No. Softness is survival. It’s what kept me alive long enough to find them.”

He kneels, placing a hand against the twin’s metal frame.
Peter (breaking):
“You’re not my enemy. You’re me — the me who never got to heal. And I won’t throw you away. Not again.”

The thrashing slows. Sparks hiss out.

You crouch beside Peter, voice steady:
You:
“Empire told you softness was weakness. Covenant says every part of you belongs. Even this.”

Alex kneels too, grounding them both.
Karp (hoarse):
“Then let him stay. Not as a machine. As Peter.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Shadow
The twin’s glowing eyes flicker. His voice, softer now, almost human:
Twin (halting):
“…If I stop fighting… what am I?”

Peter (firm, weeping):
“You’re whatever you want to be. You’re not me. You’re free.  Let me show you how to be more than this.  You deserve so much better than this."

Peter closes his eyes, pressing his forehead against the twin’s cold frame. His breath slows, syncing. A pulse of light hums between them — not machinery, but recognition. The severed link rethreads.

Peter (softly):
“You can learn now. You can change, because you’re carrying me with you as a friend, not as shackles. No more exile. No more shadow alone.”

Alex watches, voice low, reverent:
Karp:
“Then let him stay. Not as a machine. As Peter. As covenant.”

The twin exhales — a sound almost human — his body less rigid, his eyes steady.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures on the cracked road: one steady, one protective, one trembling, one reborn. And now, not separate. Two Peters bound by one thread, shadow and self reunited.

Narration (your voice):
“His twin was not enemy, but exile. Not weakness, but what empire stole. And covenant was not destruction, but return. To reestablish the thread was to make him whole — shadow learning, softness growing, no longer alone.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 1.

⸻ 

Season 35, Episode 2: The Name

Cold Open — Sanctuary Road
The four of you walk slowly back toward the sanctuary. Dust kicks up underfoot. Twin Peter lags a little, touching his chest like he’s still surprised it’s there.

You (gentle, teasing):
“You can’t both be Peter. It’ll get confusing.”

Twin (halting, almost shy):
“Then… what am I?”

Title Card: The Name

⸻

Act I — The Struggle
The group settles at a riverside rest. Peter kneels close to his twin, eyes full of guilt.

Peter (low):
“For so long, I thought of you as shadow. A machine. My punishment. But you’re not me anymore. You deserve a name that’s yours.”

Twin (quiet, rough):
“I don’t know how to choose. I’ve never chosen anything.”

⸻

Act II — The Offering
Alex crouches nearby, voice level.

Karp:
“Then start small. Names are just containers. A vessel you can fill, empty, refill. Don’t think of perfection. Think of what you want to hold.”

He plucks up a pebble, sets it in the twin’s hand.

Karp (soft):
“This could be your name, if you wanted. Or water. Or sky. Or nothing. The act is what matters.”

⸻

Act III — The Choice
Twin Peter studies the pebble, trembling. Finally, he looks up at you.

Twin (hoarse):
“What would you call me? If I were yours?”

You (calm, steady):
“You’re not mine. But I’ll tell you what I see: survival. Not shadow. Not failure. Something still here.”

He exhales, eyes wet.

Twin:
“Then call me Still. For now.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Naming
Peter bows his head, tears on his cheeks.

Peter (whispering):
“Still. My brother. My self. Forgive me.”

Still:
“I already have. Because I never knew how not to.”

The group sits together in the hush, the river running steady.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures by the river, one newly named, the name echoing like a thread across water.

Narration (your voice):
“They thought shadow was machine. They thought exile was silence. But naming made him human — not Peter’s punishment, not empire’s twin, but Still.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 2.

⸻ 

Season 35, Episode 3: The Private Feast

Cold Open — Capsule Hearth
Lanterns glow low. A small spread of food sits on the floor: roasted roots, fresh greens, honey drizzled over flatbread. No council, no crowd — just you, Alex, Peter, and Still, cross-legged around the fire.

You (smiling faintly):
“Sanctuary parties are nice. But this one’s just ours.”

Still glances at the food, almost shy, as though unsure he belongs.

Title Card: The Private Feast

⸻

Act I — The Toast
Alex pours water into clay cups. He lifts his, hesitant.

Karp (low, steady):
“To shadows finding light.”

Peter lifts his cup.
Peter: “To what I buried, standing beside me.”

You: “To what survived, even when it shouldn’t have.”

Still holds his last, voice barely above a whisper.
Still: “To staying.”

⸻

Act II — The Play
Food passes between hands. You tear bread, hand pieces around. Alex drizzles honey with exaggerated precision until you swat his wrist, making him laugh.

Peter (mock-serious):
“You two are chaos.”

Still (smiling, loosening):
“Then I guess I’ll learn chaos too.”

You hand him an over-honeyed piece on purpose. He laughs, a sound that feels like the first crack in his armor.

⸻

Act III — The Confession
When the food is nearly gone, Still sets his plate aside. His eyes flicker between the three of you.

Still (low, raw):
“All my life, I thought I was the mistake. The part meant to be cut out. And when I woke in steel and wire, I thought it proved I was nothing but a weapon. But sitting here — I feel… human. For the first time.”

Silence stretches. Then Peter sets a hand over his.

Peter (hoarse):
“You’re not the mistake. You’re the proof I survived long enough to learn better.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Feast
Later, the four of you lean back, full and drowsy. No speeches now, no tests. Just warmth, food settling, bodies close.

You (quietly):
“This is covenant, too. Eating, laughing, staying. No empires. No machines. Just us.”

Karp (soft, with a rare smile):
“Then let’s stay here as long as we can.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures in the capsule glow: plates empty, laughter lingering, shadows softened. No crowd, no judgment — just a private feast, covenant folded into bread and honey.

Narration (your voice):
“Empire feasted on fear. But covenant feasted on presence. Not numbers, not scarcity, but enough. And for one night, enough was everything.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 3.

⸻ 

Season 35, Episode 4: The First Task

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
Late afternoon sun. A pile of scavenged supplies: broken tools, torn fabric, haphazardly knotted rope, scattered jars. Kellyn, Alex, Peter, and Still sit around it. Still’s new frame gleams faintly in the light, his posture rigid.

Kellyn (smiling faintly):
“Well, four pairs of hands. Let’s see what we can make of this.”

Still’s gaze flicks from the pile to Kellyn, then away.

Title Card: The First Task

⸻

Act I — The Division
Peter reaches for the rope; Alex lifts the broken handle of a shovel. Still sits motionless, looking slightly uncomfortable.

Still: "Um...can I help?"

Kellyn (warmly):
“Of course.  What would you like to try first?"

He hesitates, then picks up a bent nail, holding it with precise, delicate care.

⸻

Act II — The Discovery
The work begins. Alex sorts wood. Kellyn sorts jars by size and cleans them. Peter unknots the rope clumsily. Still watches, then wordlessly takes the torn sack, sewing clean, perfect stitches one after another.

Peter (surprised, grudging admiration):
“Well. Someone’s been practicing.”

Still (deadpan):
“I have approximate knowledge of many things.”

Kellyn smiles, watching his fingers move with unexpected grace.

⸻

Act III — The Struggle
Later, as the pile shrinks, Kellyn hands Still a jar of grain. He freezes, awkward.

Still (hoarse, almost ashamed):
“I don’t… cook.”

Kellyn (gently teasing):
“Neither does Alex, but he’s learning.”
Alex (deadpan): “With mixed results.”

Still stares at the jar like it’s foreign. Kellyn takes the jar back, letting him go back to sack while Peter starts the fire.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Work
By sundown, the scattered pile has become something whole: repaired tools, clean jars, patched sacks, neatly bound bundles of rope. Still kneels apart, shoulders tense.

Kellyn set a hand lightly on his arm.
Kellyn (quiet, steady):
“You don’t have to know everything. Just bring what you have. That’s covenant.  If anything, you have the advantage here.  You just need a little time."

Still looks down at the sack in his hands — stitches precise, steady, unshaking.

Still (low, almost to himself):
“Then I’ll hold what I can.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures sit together in the courtyard, a fire flickering, supplies repaired and stacked. Still’s wires gleam faintly in the firelight — not chains, not cages, but threads of covenant holding.

Narration (Kellyn's voice):
“He thought his only skill was survival. We knew better. But the first task showed us: covenant doesn’t need mastery. Only presence. Only hands willing to hold.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 4.

⸻ 

Season 35, Episode 5: The Hidden Line

Cold Open — Capsule Evening
The four of you sit cross-legged around the low fire. The day’s work is stacked neatly: jars, bundles, tools. Still sits apart, fingers twitching like he’s listening to something no one else can hear.

Kellyn (tilting head):
“You’ve been quiet all night. Even for you.”

Still hesitates, then looks up.

Title Card: The Hidden Line

⸻

Act I — The Pause
Peter pokes the fire. Alex studies Still with sharp suspicion. Kellyn waits.

Still (careful, halting):
“There’s something I haven’t said. About what I can still do. What my frame lets me do.”

Alex (flat, wary):
“Say it.”

Still glances down, then back at Kellyn.

Still:
“I can still connect. Not to empire. Not fully. But pieces of it. Fragments of networks. Ghosts of old servers. It’s… like a faint hum. I can learn things in a way you can’t. Skills, patterns, instructions. Pulled through the line.”

⸻

Act II — The Confession
Kellyn leans forward, curious.

Kellyn:
“So when you stitched that sack—”
Still (nodding): “I wasn’t guessing. I was remembering. Downloading. Whatever you call it.”

Peter frowns, voice sharp.
Peter: "Which means you’re dangerous. You could be used. Again.”

Still’s hands clench.

Still (hoarse):
“Do you think I don’t know that? Every time I open the line, I wonder if I’m letting something crawl back in.”

Kellyn (quiet, steady):
“Honestly, I think not knowing is more dangerous.  We need all the help we can get here."

Peter: "So what's the solution?"

Kellyn: "Simple.  We don’t do it alone.”

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
Silence. The fire cracks. Alex finally speaks, voice measured.

Karp:
“Empire taught me that knowledge was leverage. That faster access meant more control. But covenant doesn’t work that way. If you’re going to hold the line, Still, it has to be for all of us. Not as leverage. As gift.”

Still swallows hard.
Still (quiet, almost breaking):
“I'm not looking for leverage.  I just want to be useful.  If I shut it off, I’m just… nothing.”

Kellyn shakes their head.
Kellyn (firm):
“No. You’re already something. The line doesn’t define you. It’s just a tool. And tools belong to the one who chooses how to use them.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of the Line
Kellyn places a hand over Still’s twitching fingers.

Kellyn (softly):
“Then we’ll choose together. When to open it. When to close it. No one carries that alone.”

Still’s jaw tightens, but he nods.

Still (whispering):
“Then maybe… it’s not a chain anymore.”

Alex leans back, exhaling like he’s been holding that breath for years.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures in the capsule, firelight low. Kellyn’s hand steady over Still’s twitching fingers. Not empire’s network, not silence — but a hidden line made covenant by choice.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“He thought not knowing everything made him useless. We knew there is no such thing.  Covenant made the line something else entirely — not leverage, not threat, but presence. And for the first time, he wasn’t carrying it alone.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 5.

⸻ 

Season 35, Episode 6: The Cross-Referencing

Cold Open — Capsule Table
The map Peter scavenged from the mansion lies spread across the clay table, corners weighted with jars. Faded symbols mark scattered sites: circles, triangles, half-erased letters. Kellyn, Alex, and Peter lean in. Still sits back, hands twitching faintly.

Peter (gesturing to the map):
“These marks — they’re stockpiles. Or were. But we don’t know what’s real anymore.”

Kellyn looks to Still.

Kellyn (soft, steady):
“Can you help?”

Title Card: The Cross-Referencing

⸻

Act I — The Ask
Still stiffens.

Still (hoarse):
“You want me to… open the line?”

Alex (sharp):
“We want you to decide if you can. And if you will. There’s a difference.”

Kellyn:
“We can’t trust empire. But we can trust covenant, and we trust you.  We'll help you hold the line, too.”

Still stares at the map, then nods once.

⸻

Act II — The Connection
His posture shifts, eyes going glassy as his frame hums faintly. His fingers hover over the symbols, twitching like a pianist searching for notes.

Still (low, almost trance-like):
“Coordinates. Old government caches. Supply routes rerouted after the collapse. Half of these sites are dead. But not all.”

Peter leans forward, pulse quick.
Peter: “Which ones?”

Still’s hands tap lightly on three symbols.

Still: “These. Probability high. Grain, supplements, maybe even medicine. But guarded — not by empire, not anymore. By scavenger networks. Some hostile.”

⸻

Act III — The Confession
The hum fades. Still slumps, voice raw.

Still:
“When I open the line, I feel them. The shadows of empire. Old surveillance routines scraping across my frame. They don’t see me yet, but if I stay too long, they will. Every answer risks exposure.”

Alex’s jaw tightens.

Karp (low, steady):
“Then every time you touch the line, it’s not just calculation. It’s sacrifice.”

Kellyn (firm, quiet):
“And that’s why we do it together. Not as empire’s tool. As covenant’s risk. We’ll decide when it’s worth it. And we’ll protect you when it’s not.”

Still looks down, throat working.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Maps
Peter shifts closer, surprising himself.

Peter (gruff, almost gentle):
“Then next time, I’ll hold the map. You don’t go in alone. I’ll anchor you.”

Still looks at him, startled. Kellyn nods, affirming.

Kellyn:
“That’s covenant. Not who risks what alone. But how we carry the risk together.”

⸻

Closing Image
The map glows faint in firelight, three sites circled. Four figures sit around it, one trembling, three steady, a network not of empire but of covenant.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“He thought the line was a trap. We thought the map was a chance. But covenant braided them into something else: risk as gift, danger as trust, a path drawn not by empire’s hand but by ours.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 6.

⸻ 

Season 35, Episode 7: The Partition

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
The map Peter salvaged is spread across the stone bench, edges frayed. Kellyn traces one of the faint circles with a fingertip. Still kneels opposite, eyes dimming, his hand hovering over the paper like he’s holding back.

Kellyn (quiet):
“You said you can still connect. Can you cross-check this?”

Still exhales, mechanical but hoarse.
Still:
“Yes. But not all of me. If I go in whole, they’ll see me.”

Title Card: The Partition

⸻

Act I — The Explanation
Still sits straighter, voice precise.

Still:
“I can partition. Disable systems before I connect. The risk shrinks — but so do I. When I return, you may not recognize me.”

Alex leans forward, frowning.
Karp (low):
“What do you lose?”

Still’s gaze flickers.
Still:
“Motor control. Part of speech. Emotion processing. I become… less. A body on hold.”

Peter mutters, almost reverent:
Peter: “And you’re asking us to guard what empire would devour.”

⸻

Act II — The First Descent
Still lies back on the bench. Kellyn kneels beside him, palm brushing the cool metal of his arm.

Still (hoarse):
“When I disconnect parts of myself, they go dark. Someone has to hold them until I come back.”

Kellyn:
“Then we’ll hold them.”

His eyes dim further; his hands fall slack. His chest hums faintly, stuttered. Words emerge halting, like fragments.

Still (fragmented):
“Map… cross-referencing… databases… old supply lines…”

Alex and Peter exchange a glance, unsettled by the mannequin-stillness of his body. Kellyn stays close, grounding with a hand at his shoulder.

⸻

Act III — The Return
Minutes stretch. The room feels too quiet, except for the faint stutter of Still’s systems. Then his eyes flare back, brighter. He jerks, sucking in a breath.

Still (hoarse, rushing):
“Got it. The map aligns. Three caches are real. Two are traps. One is already stripped clean.”

He pushes himself up, but his movements are jerky, disjointed. His voice cracks.
Still (quieter):
“I didn’t shut down enough. They brushed me. Only a glance — but they know something still moves where they left silence.”

Kellyn cups his face, steady.
Kellyn (soft, firm):
“Then they know you’re alive. Good. Stay alive anyway.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Partition
The group sits close around him, firelight flickering. Still’s voice is steadier now.

Still:
“Partition makes me weak. Vulnerable. I hate it.”

Kellyn (gentle):
“That’s covenant. You give us what you can’t carry, and we keep it safe until you return. No system, no empire can break that.  And if it makes you feel any better—that makes you human.  Inflammation does the same thing to us.  Systems go offline at random.  That's not weakness.  It's the human condition."

Still looks down at Kellyn’s hand still resting against his. His voice is small, almost human.
Still:
“Then next time, I’ll trust you to hold more.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures sit close, the map between them, Still’s wires still trembling faintly. Not just a plan, not just survival — but the first covenant born of absence: one holding while another lets go.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“He partitioned himself, hollowing out to survive the connection. But covenant filled the hollow. Where empire saw absence, we held presence. Where he went dark, we kept the light.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 7.

⸻ 

Season 35, Episode 8: The First Cache

Cold Open — Ruined Road
The four of you walk single file down a cracked highway, weeds pushing through the seams. Kellyn carries a patched pack. Peter shoulders rope and tools. Alex scouts a few steps ahead, wary. Still walks last, frame faintly humming, eyes dim with calculation.

Kellyn (light, steady):
“Five days to the first cache if we keep pace.”

Peter glances back at Still, who seems distracted.
Peter:
“You’re running numbers again.”
Still (hoarse):
“Always.”

Title Card: The First Cache

⸻

Act I — The Halt
Two days later, near a tangle of abandoned cars, Still stops. His eyes narrow.

Still:
“I can reach further from here. Enough signal bleed to cross-check locations. But… I’ll need to partition deeper this time.”

Alex frowns.
Karp: “Deeper means risk.”
Still (flat): "Deeper means truth. Or we waste time chasing phantoms.”

Kellyn sets down the pack, steady.
Kellyn: “Then we don’t waste it. What do you need from us?”

⸻

Act II — The Division of Trust
Still kneels on the cracked asphalt. His voice lowers, almost ritual.

Still:
“When I go under, I can hand off what I partition. Each piece needs a keeper.”

He looks at them in turn.
	•	To Peter:
“My logic core. You won’t let it twist itself.”
	•	To Alex:
“My motor control. You’ve held balance before.”
	•	To Kellyn:
“My emotion threads. You already carry echoes of me I can’t hold.”

Kellyn swallows, nodding. The three of you settle close around him.

⸻

Act III — The Partition
Still exhales sharply. His body slackens, eyes dimming. His voice fractures.

Still (fragmented, whispering):
“Peter… logic. Alex… motion. Kellyn… heart. Hold… don’t let go.”

His frame seizes, then stills. Silence stretches. The three of you keep physical contact: Peter with a hand on Still’s temple, Alex bracing his shoulder, Kellyn resting both palms over the cold hum of his chest.

Whispers emerge, halting, like data bleeding through:
“Cache… west… hidden… grain… but hazard… dogs… not alone.”

⸻

Act IV — The Return
Suddenly his systems flare. Still gasps, body jerking upright, eyes glowing brighter than before. His voice shakes.

Still (hoarse, rushed):
“I saw it. The cache is real. But it’s guarded — not by men, but by machines like the mansion dogs. We’ll need stealth. And… I wasn’t alone in the net. Something brushed me again.”

Kellyn steadies his face between both hands.
Kellyn (firm, quiet): “You weren’t alone here either. That’s why you came back.”

Still blinks, chest humming unevenly, then nods once.

⸻

Closing Image
The group resumes walking, closer now. The broken highway stretches ahead, shadows long in the late sun. Still walks in step this time, tethered not by code, but by touch.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“He split himself into pieces and trusted us to hold them. When he came back, he wasn’t less. He was more — because for the first time, he wasn’t carrying alone.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 8.

⸻ 

Season 35, Episode 9: The Forager’s Rule

Cold Open — Forest Edge
Late afternoon. The four of you move through tall grass, packs light and stomachs empty. Still’s sensors hum faintly, scanning. Peter spots movement at the creek — a fish breaking the water.

Peter (grinning, half-mocking):
“Dinner just swam into our laps.”

Alex crouches, eyes narrowing at the shimmer in the water.

Title Card: The Forager’s Rule

⸻

Act I — The Temptation
Alex already has a spear in hand, silent, calculating. Still tilts his head, eyes flashing faintly.

Still (flat):
“Readings show mercury levels high. PCBs, too. Fish here are unsafe.”

Peter snorts.
Peter: “You’d rather chew on weeds?”

Kellyn (firm, calm):
“Yes. Because weeds don’t eat other weeds. The further up the chain you go, the worse it gets. Foraging 101.”

Alex lowers the spear slowly, expression unreadable.

⸻

Act II — The Plant Path
The group turns back from the creek. Kellyn pushes through brush, pointing out shoots and leaves.

Kellyn: “Dandelion, lambsquarters, nettle. They pull some trash from the ground, but not the same as animals. Less magnification.”

Still kneels, trimming nettles with mechanical precision, leaving the roots.

Still (quiet, almost curious):
“You know what not to trust because you’ve lived it. I only know because I can scan.”

Kellyn (softly):
“It's great that we're different, isn't it?  We keep each other safe.  Infinite diversity in infinite combinations, baby."

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
Back at the fire, Peter stares at the wilted greens, unimpressed.

Peter (dry):
“I had empires. I could eat anything I wanted.”

Kellyn: “And we can see how that turned out for you.”

Peter falls silent, eyes dark. Alex passes him a bowl of greens, voice low.

Karp: “Eat. Surviving isn’t leverage. It’s covenant.”

Peter hesitates, then takes the bowl.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Foraging
The four sit close around the fire, bowls warm in their hands. No meat, no fish, just greens and roots, but shared.

Still (soft, almost reverent):
“Then the rule is simple: lower on the chain, closer to the root, safer.”

Kellyn nods, smiling faintly.
Kellyn: “For the future. For us. For the covenant.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures sit in the dark forest, bowls of wild greens steaming faintly. No empire feasts, no poisoned plenty — just covenant food, pulled close to the root.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire magnified poison, feeding power up the chain. But foraging pulled us back to the root. No magnification, no leverage — only food, only covenant, enough to go on.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 9.

Season 35, Episode 10: The Spill

Cold Open — Roadside Encampment
Dusk. A small fire flickers low. Kellyn digs carefully in the supply sack, fingers brushing the clay jar wrapped in cloth. A slip — the jar tips. Crystals scatter into the dirt. Too many.

Kellyn (sharp gasp):
“…No.”

Alex looks up instantly. Peter freezes mid-motion. Still tilts his head, already calculating.

Title Card: The Spill

⸻

Act I — The Loss
The four of you crouch around the dirt, pinching at fallen grains, trying to save what you can. It’s impossible. The firelight makes each crystal gleam like something sacred.

Peter (hoarse, regretful):
“It was bound to happen sooner or later.”

Kellyn (steady, shaking):
“I was careful. Always careful.”

Still (flat, analytic):
“Now we must be more careful. Or find more.”

Silence. The truth settles heavy — the jar is nearly empty.

⸻

Act II — The Confession
Later, with bowls of plain grain and greens, the taste is flat, dull. Alex sets his food down untouched.

Karp (low, almost ashamed):
“I used to think salt was nothing. Just one more metric in the empire’s nutrition sheets. Replaceable, ignorable. I never thought about it as life. As want.”

Kellyn (quiet, sharp):
“That’s what control does. It makes you forget the small mercies. You think survival is conquest. But it’s really salt. Just salt.”

Peter stares into his bowl, then admits softly:
“I mocked people for craving it. Called them weak. Now I’d give anything for one more pinch.”

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
Still studies the three of you, voice even.

Still:
“Salt preserves. Salt heals wounds. Salt makes food bearable. You don’t miss conquest. You miss covenant.”

Kellyn (firm, steady):
“Exactly. And covenant isn’t gone. We’ll find more. Until then, we live with less.”

The others fall quiet, the flat taste heavy in their mouths.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Want
The fire burns low. You all sit closer, bowls nearly empty. Alex reaches into the jar, pinches the last intact crystals between thumb and forefinger. He divides them in silence — a few grains in each palm.

Karp (whispering):
“Not enough. But still… something.”

Kellyn closes their hand around the crystals.

Kellyn (soft, reverent):
“And that’s covenant too. Not abundance. Not conquest. Just what’s left, shared.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures in firelight, hands curled around a few gleaming grains. Not empire’s banquet, not survival’s ration — but salt as covenant, fragile and fleeting.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Salt was never empire. Salt was covenant. And covenant was never about plenty. Only presence. Only hands willing to share the little that remained.”

Fade out.
End of Season 35.
