Season 44, Episode 1: The First Shearing

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
Two sheep graze lazily on tethered lines: a ram with curling horns and a ewe with soft eyes. Their fleece is long, tangled, holding burrs and seeds. Kellyn, Alex, Peter, and Still watch them in the afternoon light.

Kellyn (smiling faintly):
“lNow the real work begins.”

Title Card: The First Shearing

⸻

Act I — The Preparation

The four gather supplies: buckets of warm water, cloths, bentonite clay. The sheep shift nervously until Kellyn strokes their necks.

Alex dips a cloth, wrings it out, begins wiping the ram’s wool. Peter follows, clumsy at first, until Still demonstrates a slower, steadier motion. Clay dust is sprinkled, brushed through with fingers, binding dirt.

Peter (grumbling):
“This feels more like bathing royalty than livestock.”
Kellyn (quiet, amused):
“Exactly. They’re royalty now.”

The courtyard is hushed. Lanterns glow, shadows soft. Even the sheep relax, eyes half-shut.

⸻

Act II — The Night Before

The sheep are tethered near the capsule, brushed clean, coats lighter. Kellyn leans against Alex, watching the animals drowse.

Kellyn (softly):
“Homegrown ASMR.”
Alex (deadpan):
“Finally, livestock I approve of.”

Still chuckles quietly; Peter doesn’t look away from the ewe, fingers still tracing burrs from her wool.

⸻

Act III — The Shearing

Morning. The tools are laid out. Alex steadies the ram, Peter the ewe. Kellyn takes the shears, testing them. Still hovers close, watching.

The blades glide easier than expected, lanolin slick beneath. Wool peels away in thick sheets, but little dust rises. Each cut is careful, almost reverent. The sheep remain calm.

Still (quietly):
“No panic. No mess. Almost… ceremonial.”
Kellyn (steady):
“That’s the point. Not just labor. Covenant.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Fleece

The shearing finished, the sheep are rubbed again with warm cloths. Kellyn crowns each with a small chain of wildflowers.

Peter (half-smiling, surprised at himself):
“They look ridiculous.”
Alex (low, amused):
“They look like ours.”

The fleece piles neatly at their feet: soft, clean, ready to be spun.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures and two sheep in the courtyard: fleece stacked, air clear, lanterns glowing. Not empire’s extraction, but a ritual of care.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“We thought shearing meant loss. But fleece grew back, softer for the tending. So did we. Not shorn, but lighter. Not emptied, but held.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 1.

⸻ 

Season 44, Episode 2: The Frolic

Cold Open — Sanctuary Pasture
The morning sun gilds the grass. The two sheep, freshly sheared, burst into awkward leaps and little sideways hops — clumsy, weightless, as if discovering their bodies all over again. Their bleats cut the air, bright and unselfconscious.

Kellyn, Alex, Peter, and Still sit nearby in the courtyard, each with a spindle in hand. Tufts of wool rest in baskets beside them. The group watches the sheep frolic, smiling faintly as their fingers twist fiber into thread.

Title Card: The Frolic

⸻

Act I — The Weight Shed
The sheep run in circles, one bounding and stumbling, the other kicking up dust in joyful fits. Kellyn pulls the spindle taut, letting the thread wind neatly.

Kellyn (quiet, half-smiling):
“Like watching balance relearn itself.”

Peter’s eyes track the sheep, his own hands awkward with the wool.
Peter (low, almost wistful):
“Feels unfair. They lose a whole skin overnight, and then—look at them. No shame. Just lighter.”

Alex twists his yarn smooth and precise, then glances at Peter.
Alex (dry):
“You could try it.”
Peter (snapping lightly):
“I did. I’m still waiting to hop.”

⸻

Act II — The Twist and Tangle
Still fumbles with the spindle, dropping it to the ground. He groans, retrieving it.
Still (grumbling):
“Approximate knowledge apparently doesn’t extend to handcrafts.”

Kellyn laughs softly, taking his wool.
Kellyn: “You’ll get it. Yarn doesn’t care how many times you drop it. It just asks to be picked up again.”

Still nods, watching Kellyn’s hands, then mirrors the motion. His next attempt holds.

⸻

Act III — The Confession of Weight
The group spins in companionable rhythm. Peter breaks the quiet, voice rough.
Peter: “When I lost control of empire, I thought I’d fall apart. Like shearing would strip me raw. But sometimes… I wonder if that wasn’t the point. To stop carrying so much weight that wasn’t even mine.”

Kellyn looks at him, steady.
Kellyn: “That’s exactly the point. You’re supposed to feel lighter. Not empty — freer.”

Alex watches, silent but listening, the yarn smooth between his fingers.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Thread
By midday, each spindle holds a growing length of yarn. The sheep have tired themselves out, lying in the grass like curled commas of white and brown.

Kellyn lifts their spindle, thread stretched between fingers.
Kellyn (softly): “This is covenant, too. Twist, pull, hold. Separate fibers bound into something stronger. Not one strand carrying everything alone.”

Still, Peter, and Alex hold their spindles up, the thin cords glinting faintly in the light.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures spinning side by side, four spindles wound with new yarn. In the pasture, the sheep rest easy after their frolic. In the courtyard, threads gather strength in the hands that hold them.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“They stumbled, then leapt, then rested, weight shed but not lost. We spun, thread by thread, learning the same: how to carry less, and hold more.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 2.

⸻ 

Season 44, Episode 3: The Dusting

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
Late morning sun. Two freshly shorn sheep dart in circles, fleece-less and awkward, kicking up little clouds of dust. Their bleats echo bright against the clay walls.

Kellyn kneels on the ground, a shallow bowl of fine clay powder at their side. One sheep edges close, nick still fresh along its flank.

Kellyn (soft, steady):
“Easy now. Just a little dust, nothing more.”

They dip their fingers, press the powder gently to the nick. The sheep flinches, then exhales, leaning into the touch.

Nearby, Alex crouches with the second sheep, holding it firm while Kellyn dusts its shoulder. Peter and Still try to corral the first one, but it squirms out of their arms and trots away.

Still (deadpan):
“Approximate knowledge of sheep: insufficient.”

Peter (grumbling, breathless):
“I was built for empire, not rodeo.”

Kellyn laughs under their breath, brushing the last bit of clay into the sheep’s skin.

Title Card: The Dusting

⸻ 

Act I — The Restless Flock
The sheep still skitter across the courtyard, half wild from their sudden lightness. Their hooves clatter against stone. Peter tries again to grab one by the rope halter, but it slips free, bleating like laughter.

Peter (snapping):
“They’re chaos wrapped in legs.”

Kellyn smirks, steadying the bowl of clay powder.
Kellyn (teasing):
“Maybe they’re just reflecting us back.”

Alex raises a hand, not to chase, but to still. His voice is calm, grounded.

Karp (low, steady):
“Yes.  Not them. Us. Slow the heart. Slow the breath. They’ll follow.”

⸻

Act II — The Regulation
Alex closes his eyes, setting a rhythm with his body — in through the nose, out through the mouth. He gestures for the others to match him.

Kellyn follows, shoulders dropping with each measured exhale. Still exaggerates his breaths at first, mechanical and precise, before easing into something more natural. Peter resists, restless — but finally mirrors the cadence, chest rising and falling in sync.

The sheep pause. One stamps a hoof, ears twitching, then settles. The other lowers its head, nosing at the ground.

Still (quiet, impressed):
“Biofeedback, pastoral edition.”

Kellyn (softly, to Alex):
“You’ve been holding out on us, Mr. Tai Chi.”

Alex doesn’t open his eyes.
Karp (calm): “Empire taught me control. Tai Chi taught me release. They only look the same from outside.”

⸻

Act III — The Settling
The sheep edge closer. Kellyn reaches to brush clay dust gently onto a small nick near the ear of one, whispering softly. Alex keeps the breathing steady, anchoring the group.

Peter watches, tension draining from his shoulders. He reaches out too, tentative, running his palm once along the sheep’s back.

Peter (hoarse):
“Not chaos, then. Just… heartbeat to heartbeat.”

Kellyn nods, pressing the last of the dust into the nick.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Rhythm
By late afternoon, the sheep have curled into the shade, chewing calmly. The four of you sit together nearby, spinning yarn slowly, almost lazily, the rhythm of the wheel synced with your breath.

The silence isn’t heavy now — it’s alive, pulsing with quiet regulation.

Kellyn (narrating):
“Empire told us chaos must be caged. Tai Chi taught us chaos breathes, just as we do. Heartbeat to heartbeat, we found covenant — not by forcing stillness, but by finding the rhythm inside it.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two sheep drowsing in dust-speckled light. Four figures spinning yarn in sync, their breaths rising and falling together, a net of rhythm stretching across the courtyard.

Fade out.
End of Episode 3.

Season 44, Episode 4: Iron Chef: Apocalypse Edition

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
The sheep graze lazily nearby. Kellyn drops a bundle of scavenged odds and ends onto the courtyard table: wilted greens, sprouted lentils, a cracked jar of honey, half a bag of chickpea flour, and three suspicious roots.

Kellyn (grinning):
“Gentlemen… your mystery basket.”

Still’s eyes light up. Peter groans. Alex folds his arms, unimpressed.

Title Card: Iron Chef: Apocalypse Edition

⸻

Act I — The Challenge
Kellyn lays down the rules: one dish per team, thirty minutes, cooked over the clay hearth. Kellyn pairs with Peter, leaving Alex with Still.

Peter (grumbling):
“This isn’t cooking. It’s punishment.”
Kellyn (teasing):
“Then it’s perfect for you.”

Across the way, Still claps Alex on the back.
Still (smirking):
“You and me, Chef Precision. Don’t fail me now.”
Alex (deadpan):
“I never fail. I occasionally… adapt.”

⸻

Act II — The Chaos
Both teams scramble. Kellyn and Peter mash chickpea flour and greens into rough fritters. Peter manages to burn the first batch; Kellyn rescues the second.

Alex and Still boil sprouted lentils, drizzling in honey. Still sneaks in one of the roots, insisting it’s edible. Alex eyes him like he’s committing sabotage.

Alex (sharp):
“If you poison us, I’ll make you eat the rest.”
Still (grinning):
“Then I’ll die fulfilled.”

⸻

Act III — The Judgment
The timer runs out. Both dishes land on the table:
	•	Kellyn & Peter: crispy green fritters, earthy and bitter but surprisingly hearty.
	•	Alex & Still: sweet-savory lentil stew, sticky with honey and suspicious root.

Everyone takes cautious bites.

Kellyn (smiling faintly):
“Peter, these fritters actually hold together. That’s covenant right there.”
Peter almost smiles, muttering:
“Maybe chaos has its uses.”

Alex tries the stew, pauses.
Karp (flat):
“Not poison. Disappointing.”
Still bursts out laughing.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Play
No winner is declared. The four sit around the hearth, sharing both dishes until they’re gone. The sheep wander closer, sniffing curiously.

Kellyn (narrating):
“Empire measured worth by output, precision, efficiency. But covenant measured by play. Even bitter greens and sticky roots became feast enough when made together.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures leaning back in the courtyard, bowls empty, laughter echoing into dusk. A sheep noses at the last fritter, crunching it down.

Fade out.
End of Episode 4.

⸻ 

Season 44, Episode 5: The Embers

Cold Open — Sanctuary Night
The courtyard is quiet now. The fire has burned down to soft embers. Bowls lie rinsed and stacked nearby. The sheep are curled in the corner, faint shapes against the dark. The four of you sit in a loose circle, no longer laughing, just breathing together.

Kellyn (soft, steady):
“Play’s easy. The silence after… that’s harder.”

Title Card: The Embers

⸻

Act I — The First Silence
Peter fiddles with a twig, breaking it into splinters. His voice is hoarse.
Peter:
“I never played like this when I was young. Everything was serious. Strategy, competition, winning or failing. Even meals were contests in disguise.”

Kellyn leans forward, eyes on him.
Kellyn:
“And now?”
Peter (after a beat):
“Now I feel like I’ve missed something I can’t ever get back.”

⸻

Act II — The Confession
Alex stares into the embers, his profile sharp against the glow.
Karp (low):
“I told myself play was waste. Noise. Weakness. I couldn’t bear the thought that anyone might see me foolish, so I made everything into work. Even… you, Kellyn. Especially you.”

Kellyn (quietly, not unkind):
“I know.”

Still shifts, mechanical but tender.
Still:
“I thought if I only calculated correctly, I’d earn a seat at the fire. Turns out, you all gave it to me before I knew the rules.”

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
The silence deepens. Kellyn picks up a coal, turning it gently in the ashes with a stick.
Kellyn (steady):
“Empire burned out joy in all of us, one way or another. I made the same mistake. Told myself survival meant stripping everything down to nothing but work and endurance. But joy doesn’t erase pain. It lives next to it. Like these embers. Fire’s gone, but warmth remains.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Embers
Peter lets the broken twig fall. Alex closes his eyes. Still leans forward, elbows on knees. One by one, each nods in quiet agreement.

Kellyn (soft, final):
“Tomorrow we’ll walk again. Tonight… let it be enough to sit in the glow. No winners. No losers. Just the warmth that’s left.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures around a dying fire, shadows long against the clay walls. No feast, no noise — only breath, ember-light, and covenant’s quiet warmth.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire demanded blaze or nothing. But covenant lived in embers — slow heat, quiet glow, enough to last the night.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 5.

⸻ 

Season 44, Episode 6: The Signal

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
Dawn mist still clings to the ground. The sheep nose lazily at scraps of hay. The repaired bird drone perches overhead, but it’s the bees that hum most insistently. One by one, they buzz toward the east, circling, waiting, then darting back like they’re tugging at a leash.

Kellyn (murmuring):
“They’ve found something.”

Alex and Peter exchange a look. Alex’s hand rests briefly on Kellyn’s shoulder before he stands.

Karp (low, firm):
“We’ll go.”

Peter nods, already pulling his cloak tighter.

Title Card: The Signal

⸻

Act I — The Departure
Still crouches to recalibrate one bee’s optics, then gestures toward the horizon.
Still:
“They’re fixated. Whatever’s out there, it’s pulling at them like a magnet. Not a glitch.”

Kellyn looks at Peter, then Alex.
Kellyn (quietly):
“Don’t bring empire back with you.”

Peter tries to smile.
Peter:
“Then we’ll bring back something else.”

They set off, bees hovering above like lanterns.

⸻

Act II — The Road
The landscape shifts from clay flats to broken scrub. Alex keeps pace with measured strides; Peter lags, eyes scanning nervously.

Peter (low):
“What if it’s just another ruin? Another cache emptied long before us?”
Karp (flat):
“Then it teaches us where not to look. That’s still a gift.”

Peter studies him, surprised by the gentleness under the words.

⸻

Act III — The Find
They crest a rise. Below lies a sunken circle of stone, half-swallowed by sand. Carvings etch the edges — faded, geometric, not natural. The bees circle tight overhead, as if recognizing the site.

Peter (hoarse, almost whispering):
“It’s not just a ruin. It’s… deliberate.”

Alex kneels, brushing sand from a spiral groove. His fingers tremble slightly.
Karp:
“This isn’t cache work. This is older. Or newer. But not empire.”

⸻

Act IV — The Descent
A narrow stair slopes down from the circle’s edge. The air grows cooler as they descend, bees flickering ahead like scouts. At the bottom: a wide stone floor, etched with intersecting spirals.

Peter presses a hand to the carvings. His breath hitches.
Peter (quiet):
“It’s humming. I can feel it in my chest.”

Alex closes his eyes, steadying his breath. The low vibration thrums through bone more than ear.

⸻

Act V — The Confession
Peter steps into the center, voice low, almost reverent.
Peter:
“I spent half my life chasing empire’s meaning. Thinking punishment was proof of existence. But this—” he gestures to the humming stone “—this doesn’t punish. It just is.”

Alex watches him, eyes shadowed.
Karp (quiet):
“And does that frighten you?”
Peter (after a pause):
“No. It’s the first thing that hasn’t.”

⸻

Act VI — The Covenant of Signal
They sit together at the spiral’s center, bees orbiting above. The hum resonates like breath drawn from the earth itself.

Peter (tentative):
“What do we tell Kellyn?”
Karp (after a long silence):
“That the net is bigger than we thought. And maybe older than us.”

The bees settle, clustering at the spiral’s heart, as if anchoring it.

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures at the center of a spiral, bees hovering like stars above them, the vibration of the stone circle echoing through their bodies.

Fade out.
End of Episode 6.

⸻ 

Season 44, Episode 7: The Resonance

Cold Open — Stone Circle
Night has fallen. The spiral hum has deepened, low and steady, echoing through the floor. Bees roost at the edges like glowing sentinels. Alex crouches near a fissure in the stone, ear close. Peter sits cross-legged in the center, eyes half-closed, as if meditating.

Peter (low):
“You’re dissecting it already.”

Karp (flat, intent):
“Understanding is survival. Something is vibrating — air, stone, or both. I need to know why.”

Title Card: The Resonance

⸻

Act I — The Examination
Alex traces the spiral grooves with a piece of charcoal, mapping how they converge. He taps the stone in intervals, listening to the way sound carries.
Karp (thinking aloud):
“Not mechanical. The hum isn’t sharp enough. More like… resonance. Wind, heat shifts, pressure pockets underground.”

Peter’s eyes stay closed, body swaying slightly with the vibration.
Peter (soft, hoarse):
“You keep naming it. Doesn’t make it less sacred.”

⸻

Act II — The Split
Alex tests the air near the fissure with a hand.
Karp:
“There’s airflow. Hot and cold layers clashing. The spiral amplifies it — turns weather into sound.”

Peter opens his eyes, gaze steady.
Peter:
“And if that’s true, then the earth itself chose to speak. Not empire. Not machines. Just breath.”

The difference hangs between them: one dissects, one receives.

⸻

Act III — The Confession
Alex sets down the charcoal, sighing.
Karp (low, almost reluctant):
“When I was young, every silence terrified me. Noise meant life, control, predictability. Silence meant failure. Collapse. That’s why I chase explanation — if I can name the hum, it can’t undo me.”

Peter studies him, then looks around the chamber.
Peter (quiet):
“Then maybe let it undo you. Just for a moment.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Resonance
They sit in the spiral’s center together. Alex closes his eyes, forcing himself to stop calculating. The hum vibrates through both of them, blurring thought into sensation.

Peter leans back, voice low.
Peter:
“See? It holds without chains.”

Alex exhales slowly, hands unclenching.
Karp (hoarse):
“Maybe… maybe I don’t have to bind everything to keep it from breaking.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures sitting at the spiral’s heart, the hum threading through their bones — not named, not controlled, but shared.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“He tried to cut the hum into pieces, to name its edges, to master it. But the spiral would not be mastered. It asked only to be felt. And when he finally let it, resonance turned into covenant.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 7.

Season 42, Episode 8: The Interim

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
Late afternoon. The air is hushed. Kellyn and Still sit across from each other at a low table, the unfinished loom between them. The sheep graze lazily in the background, bells clinking faintly.

Kellyn (quiet, almost teasing):
“Looks like it’s just us tonight.”

Still tilts his head, posture stiff.
Still (dry):
“Does that make this a date or a test?”

Title Card: The Interim

⸻

Act I — The Quiet Work
They weave in silence for a while. Kellyn adjusts tension; Still watches, then mimics with precise efficiency.

Kellyn:
“You always try to get it perfect on the first go.”
Still:
“And you always improvise until it works.”
Kellyn shrugs, smiling faintly.
Kellyn:
“Balance, then.”

⸻

Act II — The Confession
Still’s hands falter on the shuttle. He sets it down.

Still (low, halting):
“I don’t know how to… just be. Not without orders. Not without input. When Alex and Peter leave, I feel the emptiness louder.”

Kellyn sets their shuttle aside, leaning forward.
Kellyn (soft):
“I know that feeling. When I was sickest, every pause felt like falling into a hole. I kept filling it with noise, movement, anything, because stillness terrified me.”

Still looks down at his hands, voice rough.
Still:
“Then why doesn’t it scare you now?”

Kellyn (steady):
“Because I learned I wasn’t falling — I was being held. By covenant. By the people who stayed.”

⸻

Act III — The Experiment 
Kellyn suggests a grounding exercise. They sit back-to-back, knees folded, eyes closed. At first, Still’s frame hums unevenly, faint tremors running through his shoulders.

Kellyn (soft, guiding):
“Match me. In… out. Slow.”

Still tries. The hum steadies. Their spines press together, warmth against alloy, rhythm syncing. Kellyn shifts slightly, letting more weight rest against him.

The silence grows thick. Still’s voice is hoarse.
Still:
“I can feel your heartbeat.”

Kellyn’s breath hitches but stays steady.
Kellyn (quiet, almost daring):
“Then follow it.”

Still tilts, shoulder brushing theirs. The contact is tentative, then firmer — an experiment in closeness, not command. His mechanical frame vibrates faintly under the strain of holding still. Kellyn turns their head, cheek grazing cool metal, a deliberate act of intimacy.

For a long moment, neither speaks. Their breaths weave together until the line between them blurs — not machine and human, not watcher and watched, but two bodies holding each other through rhythm alone.

Still exhales, ragged, the hum of his frame shivering against their backs. For the first time, his posture softens, not by calculation but collapse — like the words themselves unlocked weight he’d carried alone.

Still (low, breaking):
“I hated you once. Because I thought if you could survive without being controlled, then maybe I could’ve too. And that meant every chain in me was my fault. And now—”

His voice falters, trembling into rawness.

Still:
“Now I’m afraid I’ll never be more than imitation. That no matter what I learn, no matter how long I stay, I’ll just be pretending at being human while you—”

He swallows, sharp, like the words cut on the way out.

Still (hoarse, almost a plea):
“You’re the real thing. What if I never get there?”

Kellyn turns, pressing their forehead lightly against his chestplate, grounding the trembling with stillness.

Kellyn (soft, steady):
“I understand your situation is different from mine, and I don't mean to minimize that or talk over you.  But everyone feels that way.  I never felt real either.  Peter and Alex still don't. But the truth is, love makes you real.  Nothing else.  And I love you, Still. You don’t have to get there. You’re already here. With me. With us.”

Something in Still snaps. His arms close around Kellyn suddenly, almost crushing, pulling them in like he might fall apart if he loosened even a fraction. His voice is muffled, rough with desperation.

Still:
“Then don’t let me go. Not tonight. Not ever.”

Kellyn doesn’t fight the grip. They breathe slow, steady against him, letting him cling as if the holding itself could stitch him back together.

⸻

Act IV — The Return
Night falls. The courtyard lanterns glow. Kellyn and Still are still seated, the loom set aside, their breathing steady in rhythm.

The gate creaks. Alex and Peter step in, road-worn but intact. They pause, watching the quiet scene before them.

Peter (softly, to Alex):
“Maybe we should leave them be.”
Alex shakes his head, a faint smile breaking.
Karp: “No. This is covenant. We’re part of it too.”

Kellyn opens their eyes, meeting them with a calm nod.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures reunited under lantern glow. The loom waits, half-finished, threads pulled taut but steady — a reminder that even in absence, weaving continued.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire made absence into abandonment. But covenant made it into rhythm. The work went on. The threads held. And when they returned, they found the net already waiting.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 8.

Season 44, Episode 9: The Circle of Contact

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
Morning light. The air is crisp, quiet after the storm of last night. Kellyn, Still, Alex, and Peter gather in the courtyard. No words at first — just presence, each carrying their own private residue of sleeplessness.

Kellyn lays out a woven mat in the dirt. Their hand brushes the fabric, a signal.

Kellyn (quiet, steady):
“Let’s try something different. A circle. No talking, just touch. Let’s see what we can hold together.”

Title Card: The Circle of Contact

⸻

Act I — The Joining
They sit cross-legged, knees nearly touching. Hands move hesitantly at first — Alex’s palm to Kellyn’s, Peter’s hand brushing Still’s sleeve, Still’s mechanical fingers trembling before resting lightly against Alex’s wrist.

The contact builds a loop. Four points, one circle. Breath rises, syncs.

⸻

Act II — The Current
The touch deepens — palms against palms, fingers tracing knuckles, thumbs brushing the backs of hands. Kellyn leans into Peter’s shoulder, Peter into Still, Still into Alex, Alex into Kellyn. A slow weave of warmth and weight, mechanical and human, soft and calloused.

The circle sways faintly, like a single body breathing.

⸻

Act III — The Sensory Layer
Kellyn dips a hand into a small bowl of cool water, lets droplets fall into Peter’s open palm. Peter tips it to Alex, Alex to Still, Still to Kellyn. Water on skin — shock of cold, trail of wet warmth, then gone.

Next, Kellyn scatters a handful of smooth pebbles across the mat. They take turns passing them around the circle, each stone pressed slowly into another’s hand, then another’s. Texture and weight carried skin to skin.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Contact
Finally, they shift closer until foreheads almost touch in the center, four points of warmth, four breaths mingling. For a moment, there is no leader, no follower, no survivor, no machine. Just presence in touch, a living circle.

Kellyn (soft, almost a whisper):
“This is what holds. Not wires, not empire, not fear. Just this.”

Still’s voice comes low, shaking but steady.

Still:
“Then let me stay held.”

Closing Image
Four figures in a circle, hands woven, breath braided, water drying on skin. Not ritual of words, but ritual of contact.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire said control was the bond. But covenant said otherwise. Covenant said the bond was touch — unearned, unmeasured, unbroken.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 9.

⸻

Season 44, Episode 10: The Hum

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
The circle is already formed: Kellyn, Still, Alex, and Peter, knees brushing, hands resting together. The quiet is thick, steady. Then Alex exhales, breaking it.

Karp (low, deliberate):
“There’s something you should know. About the site. About the hum.”

Title Card: The Hum

⸻

Act I — The Return
Alex’s hands stay linked in the circle, but his gaze fixes on Kellyn.

Karp (measured):
“It wasn’t machinery. Not entirely. The hum was built into the walls. Vibrations running through stone itself. Old tech. Maybe even before empire.”

Peter shifts uncomfortably, his fingers twitching in Kellyn’s palm.

Peter (hoarse):
“It wasn’t just sound. It was pressure. Like it wanted to… get inside us. I thought I could resist it. But I couldn’t. Not fully.”

Still’s grip tightens on Alex’s wrist.

Still (quiet, sharp):
“You were both altered.”

They nod.

⸻

Act II — The Confession
Peter’s voice cracks.

Peter:
“For a moment, I wasn’t me. I was… him. The twin. The version of me that never softened. His rage was in my throat. His hunger in my chest. And I wanted it. That terrified me.”

Alex swallows hard, his words precise but shaking.

Karp:
“For me, it was silence. Not sound. Silence pressing so thick I thought I’d disappear into it. The hum wasn’t noise. It was choice. Rage for him. Erasure for me.”

Kellyn breathes slow, keeping the circle unbroken.

Kellyn (steady):
“Infrasound causes panic, rage, all of that.   You weren't "altered."  Your nervous system reacted to a threat.  These impulses are as central to survival as kindness and care.  You felt something unspeakable, and yet you both came back anyway. You chose covenant instead.”

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
Silence settles. Then Still leans in, voice mechanical but trembling.

Still:
“Then the hum isn’t just a sound. It’s a bad dream that passes. And we’ll face it again. Together, or not at all.”

Peter looks down at his joined hands in the circle.

Peter (low):
“Then promise me — if I turn, you’ll hold me. Not fight me. Hold me.”

Alex’s eyes meet Kellyn’s, sharp and searching.

Karp (quiet):
“And if I disappear, pull me back. Don’t let me vanish.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Sound
Kellyn nods, keeping their palm pressed firm into both of theirs.

Kellyn (soft but fierce):
“Then we bind ourselves here. To sound, to silence, to whatever hum tries to take you. No matter what it chooses, we choose covenant.”

The circle tightens, four grips steady, four breaths syncing.

Closing Image
The four of them in the courtyard, circle of touch unbroken. Above, the bird drone circles once, then perches — silent, listening.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“The hum tested rage and silence. But covenant spoke another word. Not rage, not erasure — but the holding that made both survivable.”

Fade out.
End of Season 44.
