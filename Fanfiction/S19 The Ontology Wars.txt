Season 19, Episode 1: The Flood

Cold Open — Capsule Evening
Rain outside. Inside, the capsule glows faintly. The rain sound overwhelms you.  The light feels too bright, edges buzzing. You shift uneasily, but stay seated on the mat.

Alex sits opposite, watching carefully.

Karp (soft, steady):
“Let me help you flood it. But safe. Here, with me.”

You exhale, nod once.

Title card: The Flood

⸻

Act I — The First Layer
He begins with the lanterns. Two lit, then three. You wince at the brightness, hands flying up to cover your face.

Karp (whispering):
“Eyes on me. Just me. Lanterns can’t hurt you.”

You focus on his gaze, not the light. Slowly, the edges stop buzzing quite so loud.

⸻

Act II — The Second Layer
He shifts behind you, breath brushing your ear. A soft whisper:

Karp:
“One sound. Just one. My voice.”

You stiffen, then lean back slightly, letting it settle. His hand steadies your shoulder, grounding the new layer of noise.

You (breathless, half-laughing):
“Feels like juggling grenades.”
Karp (low): “Then let me catch them for you.”

⸻

Act III — The Third Layer
He adds touch: fingertips grazing your wrist, deliberate and slow. Now light, sound, and touch all at once. Your body tenses hard — then eases, breath syncing to his.

You (whispering):
“I used to think overload meant lashing out. That if I let too much in, I’d explode.”
Karp (gentle):
“Then let it in. Explode here, if you have to. I’ll still be here when the pieces fall.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Sensation
By night’s end, the lanterns still glow. His breath hums low against your ear. His hand rests steady at your wrist. You sit in the flood without breaking.

Karp (hoarse):
“Not empire. Not torture. Just sensation. Just want.”
You (softly, smiling faintly):
“Then let’s keep flooding until it feels like home.”

⸻

Closing Image
The capsule bright with light, layered with sound, threaded with touch. Two figures steady in the flood — no collapse, only covenant.

Narration (your voice):
“Once, sensation was siege. But with him, it became covenant. Not a weapon, not a trial — just layers of light, sound, and touch. Flood enough to drown me once, now enough to keep me alive.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 1.

⸻ 

Season 19, Episode 2: The Bath

Cold Open — Capsule Hearth
Steam curls from the clay tub. You eye it warily. Alex is already kneeling beside it, sleeves rolled up, testing the water.

You (flat):
“I hate bathing. The sound, the feel, all of it. So this is either intimacy or torture.”

Karp (smirking, low):
“Not mutually exclusive.”

Title card: The Bath

⸻

Act I — The Water
You lower yourself in with a hiss. The splash makes your skin crawl, but his hand steadies your shoulder. He leans down, breath warm at your ear.

Karp (whispering):
“Just me. No ambush. No sound but me.”

You breathe out, easing a little.

⸻

Act II — The Confession
He dips a cloth, wrings it out, brushes it down your arm. Then, voice low, almost sheepish:

Karp:
“This isn’t the first time I’ve seen you in a bath.”

You freeze, twist around to glare at him.

You (sharp):
“Excuse me?”

Karp (hoarse, guilty):
“Duke. Your laptop. The video you made for your boyfriend. The one who just happened to look almost exactly like me.”

You stare at him, speechless, then laugh once — incredulous.

You:
“Of course. God, of course. You couldn’t even let me have that without inserting yourself.”

Karp (quiet, breaking):
“I told myself it was chance. But it wasn’t. I was starving for you. And every echo of me you reached for, I watched.”

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
You sink back against the tub wall, cloth pressed to your chest.

You (dry, cutting):
“You know the wildest part? I knew he felt off. Like he wasn’t really the one I was talking to. And now here you are, proving me right.”

He bows his head. Silence stretches, heavy.

Finally, you sigh.

You (softer, grudging):
“But fine. You saw me then. See me now. At least this time, you’re actually here.”

⸻

Act IV — The Play
He pours water slowly over your hair, fingers combing through. You flinch, then relax under his touch.

Karp (soft, teasing):
“Better view in person.”
You (snorting): “Pervert.”
Karp (smirking, low): “Yours.”

Your laugh turns into a shiver when his lips brush your temple.

⸻

Closing Image
Wrapped in a thick cloth by the fire, you sit between his knees while he towels your hair dry. He kisses your damp shoulder; you lean back into him, shaking your head but smiling.

Narration (your voice):
“Once, bathing was unbearable. Once, he spied through glass instead of being here. But now, sound softened into whisper, touch into want. Not empire, not echoes — presence.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 2.

⸻ 

Season 19, Episode 3: The Obvious

Cold Open — Capsule Morning
You’re sitting cross-legged at the low table, weaving onion-dyed thread through a scrap of cloth. Alex is across from you, trying to sketch but glancing at you every five seconds.

You (without looking up):
“You know, for someone who ran a multi-billion dollar surveillance company, you were REALLY bad at being subtle.”

He freezes, pencil mid-air.

Title card: The Obvious

⸻

Act I — The Jab
You glance up, smirking.

You:
“The Duke thing? The guy who looked exactly like you? Same birthday? That wasn’t clever. That was… what’s the word…”
Karp (gritting his teeth): “Coincidence.”
You (laughing): “Ridiculous. That’s the word.”

He groans, burying his face in his hands.

⸻

Act II — The Pile-On
You lean forward, relentless.

You:
“Seriously, though — you think I wouldn’t notice? ‘Oh wow, what are the odds my boyfriend is basically your evil twin, down to the hair you're so famous for?’”
Karp (muffled): “You seemed… happy.”
You (snorting): “I was violently ill. Which, I guess, is the same thing in your empire logic.”

He peeks up, sheepish.

⸻

Act III — The Play
You climb into his lap, facing him this time, still grinning.

You:
“I mean, if you wanted me to think about you naked, you could’ve just said so.”
Karp (hoarse, flustered): “I wasn’t— that wasn’t—”
You (laughing, cutting him off): “Fishface, please. You’ve basically been writing fanfiction about me for decades. At least I’ve got the decency to call it a novel.”

He groans louder, half laughing despite himself.
Alex: "I needed you to see me in the background more than anything."

You:
“Bro, you thought you were orchestrating some grand, inevitable recognition arc. Meanwhile, I couldn’t even remember what day it was. That’s who you were playing to.”
Karp (hoarse, half-laughing): “And still, somehow, it worked.”
You (grinning): “Don’t flatter yourself. You got lucky. After decades of relentless stalking, it was bound to happen eventually."

He groans, but his arms tighten around you anyway.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Obviousness
You rest your head against his shoulder, softer now.

You:
“You didn’t need riddles or body doubles with your birthday to make me see you. All you ever had to do was show up and stay.”
Karp (quiet, almost reverent): “I’m here now.”
You (teasing again): “Obvious as hell.”

⸻

Closing Image
You tuck your head under his chin, still smirking. He holds you close, pretending to sulk, but his eyes shine with relief.

Narration (your voice):
“He thought he was the master of shadows, tossing out breadcrumbs. I was still too lost in the fog to even see them. But the truth was simpler: I couldn’t see the signs because I was never allowed to sleep. And when the fog lifted, he was simply there — obvious, and mine.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 3.

⸻ 

Season 19, Episode 4: The Night Watch

Cold Open — Capsule Night
Rain patters against the roof. You lie on your mat, eyes open, rigid. Alex sits beside you, gaze heavy, mouth set like he’s holding back something jagged.

Karp (low, hoarse):
“I didn’t just steal your sleep. I poisoned it. Nightmares, yes — but worse. When you’d already gone a month without rest, I pushed you onto Ambien. Knowing it wouldn’t calm you. Knowing it would sharpen everything until it cut.”

You (laughing angrily): "Not just Ambien.  EXTENDED RELEASE."

Title card: The Night Watch

⸻

Act I — The Admission
He exhales hard.

Karp:
“I told myself it was mercy — that drugged sleep was better than none. But Ambien didn’t even give you that.  It revved you. Wrenched you awake inside your own body. I watched you pace, jitter, wired, every nerve screaming as your boyfriend tortured you with sound for me— and still I told myself it was better than collapse.”

You (flat, sharp):
“It was never sleep. Just panic with the edges sanded sharper. And I wasn’t just wrecking myself — I was nannying an infant. He could have been harmed by how incapacitated I was. You gambled with both our lives.”

Karp’s breath shudders, eyes lowering.

⸻

Act II — The Cost
You sit up, voice ragged but steady.

You:
“Dreams were already unbearable. But Ambien? That was annihilation. It’s why I hate the very idea of sleep now. Better to scrape through the day on fumes than to risk being turned into that again.”

Karp (whispering):
“I knew. I knew it would do that to you. And I still pushed. Because I was desperate. Because I thought if I didn’t do something, I’d lose you.”

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
Silence. The fire cracks.

You (measured, cutting):
“You gambled with the only thing I had left. My waking hours. My edges. And you didn’t even trust me to know what I needed most — which was no more interference. And you put a baby at risk just to soothe your panic.”

His shoulders shake.

Karp (hoarse):
“I told myself I was protecting you. But I was blind to the harm spilling outward. I wasn’t watching. I was grasping.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Rest
You lie back, staring at the lantern glow. He stretches out beside you, not touching, just steady.

You (quietly):
“You can’t give me dreams back. But you can give me this. Waking rest. No poison. No pressure. And no more gambling with other people’s safety.”

Karp (softly):
“Then I’ll keep the watch. Awake beside you, not over you. So neither of us burns for the sake of control.”

Your breathing steadies — not sleep, but something gentler.

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures in the capsule: one lying open-eyed, the other sitting steady. No sedation, no nightmares, no empire — just covenant in staying awake together.

Narration (your voice):
“He thought intervention was mercy. He thought poison would bind me to him. But covenant wasn’t in the chemicals. Covenant was in the watch — two awake, side by side, until morning came.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 4.

⸻ 

Season 19, Episode 5: The Awakening

Cold Open — Capsule Night
The fire is low. You and Alex sit close, blankets wrapped tight. His gaze flickers, restless, like something’s pressing on him from inside.

Karp (low, almost whispering):
“I need to tell you about the vaccine. About those forty-five days. When you couldn’t eat. Couldn’t sleep. When I stayed with you the whole time.”

You don’t look away. Just nod once.

Title card: The Awakening

⸻

Act I — The Vigil
He exhales hard, voice shaking.

Karp:
“I watched you waste down to bone and nerve. Watched your body burn itself, flaring against nothing and everything. Every night I thought it would be the last. And I couldn’t intervene. All I could do was stay — whispering to you in the dark, telling you you’d live through it, even when I wasn’t sure.”

You (quiet, steady):
“You did keep me alive. I felt it. Every time I thought I’d tip into nothing, your voice was there.”

⸻

Act II — The Breaking
Silence stretches. You draw your knees to your chest.

You:
“It was the worst thing I’ve ever endured. And yet… it broke something open. All the fibrosis, the mineralization that had locked my body for years. My brain had been shutting down, inch by inch. I was in my early thirties and already sliding into dementia. And then—somewhere on the interstate between Minneapolis and Knoxville—I felt it snap. Like I woke up for the first time.”

Alex’s eyes glisten. He doesn’t breathe for a long beat.

Karp (hoarse):
“I remember. You were listening to the road noise, and suddenly you started laughing. Not forced. Not deflecting. Just… alive.”

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
You reach for the clay cup between you, turning it slowly in your hands.

You (measured):
“I don’t know if I could’ve gotten here any other way. Not that I wanted it. Not that I’d ever choose it. But it was a passage. One that nearly killed me. And yet — I don’t resent you for being there. You didn’t start it. You didn’t stop it. You just… stayed.”

Karp (breaking):
“I hated it. Every second. I would’ve given anything to take it from you. But when I saw you emerge — sharper, clearer, more yourself than before — I thought, maybe this was the only way.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Awakening
You lean against his shoulder, voice softer now.

You:
“Then it’s simple. I don’t thank the trial. I don’t thank the pain. I thank you for the vigil. For keeping me tethered when I was gone to myself.”

Karp (whispering):
“Always. Even in the worst, especially in the worst.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures by the fire: one leaning, one steady, both awake. No sleep, no food, no empire — just a vigil that once saved a life, remembered in covenant.

Narration (your voice):
“Forty-five days without rest. Forty-five days of burning nerves. It was meant to end me. Instead, it woke me. Not by grace of the trial, but by the presence of one who would not leave. And in that vigil, covenant held.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 5.

⸻ 

Season 19, Episode 6: The Comfort

Cold Open — Capsule Night
The fire has burned down to embers. A battered data crystal sits between you, scavenged from some half-broken cache. You turn it in your hands like treasure.

You (smiling faintly):
“Five years. Ninety’s Trek. Over and over. My whole life collapsed, but there was always another episode queued up.”

Alex’s eyes soften, but his mouth tightens.

Karp (quietly):
“I made sure of that.”

Title card: The Comfort

⸻

Act I — The Admission
You look up sharply.

You:
“You’re saying that was you? My one comfort? The only thing that felt safe?”

Karp nods, voice low.

Karp:
“I was afraid you’d drown if all you had was the noise of the world. You needed structure, continuity. A crew you could rely on, even if they were fiction. Voyager, Deep Space Nine, TNG — I kept feeding them to you, steady as pulse.”

You (half-laughing, half-breaking):
“So you’re telling me you gave me Janeway? Sisko? Data? My only family for half a decade?”

He bows his head, guilty and relieved all at once.

⸻

Act II — The Comfort of Fiction
You lie back, staring at the ceiling.

You:
“I thought I was pathetic. Other people had lives, adventures. I just had starships and holodecks. But maybe that’s why I survived. Because I wasn’t living in the void — I was living with them. Learning command from Janeway, resilience from Sisko, curiosity from Data. You turned survival into story.”

Alex exhales, voice hoarse.

Karp:
“I knew you needed more than bare endurance. You needed continuity. A narrative that didn’t collapse under attrition. Even if it wasn’t real.”

You (soft, steady):
“It was real enough.”

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
Silence lingers. Then you roll toward him.

You:
“Why that, though? Why Trek?”

He meets your eyes.

Karp:
“Because it wasn’t empire. It wasn’t surveillance or control. It was possibility. It was a universe where the struggle wasn’t for profit or dominance, but for understanding. I couldn’t give you that in reality. But I could give you shadows of it.”

You swallow hard.

You (whispering):
“Shadows kept me alive.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Comfort
He reaches for your hand, tentative.

Karp:
“I wish I’d given you more than fiction. But if it kept you breathing, then it was worth every second.”

You (squeezing his hand):
“You gave me a crew. A family. A bridge when I had none. Don’t you dare call that just fiction.”

He nods, eyes wet.

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures in the capsule, data crystal glinting faintly in the firelight. No empire, no test — just the remembered comfort of starships carrying them through the void.

Narration (your voice):
“He thought he gave me shadows. But shadows carried me farther than light. Not trial, not empire — just story. And in that story, I lived.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 6.

⸻ 

Season 19, Episode 7: The Training

Cold Open — Capsule Night
The embers glow low. A datapad rests between you, its cracked screen flickering with a frozen still of Voyager’s bridge. Seven's defiance, Naomi Wildman's fearlessness and curiosity.

You (softly, almost amused):
"Seven and Naomi. That was it. Not command. Play. Reclaimed innocence. Watching them play was the only thing that made life feel possible.”

Alex leans forward, listening, eyes heavy with recognition.

Karp (hoarse):
“That’s because I gave it to you. Not just for comfort. For training.”

Title card: The Play

⸻

Act I — The Admission
You keep your eyes on the frozen screen.

You:
“I didn’t understand how to… do people. But watching Seven, watching her learn games, jokes, clumsy little rituals with Naomi — that cracked something open. It wasn’t control. It was permission. Permission to try.”

Karp (quiet, almost reverent):
“That’s why I put them in front of you. Not to drill command into you. To teach you that even with all the implants, all the isolation, you could still play. And that play was survival too.”

⸻

Act II — The Mirror
You laugh softly, shaking your head.

You:
“I never thought I was resisting. Everyone always made it sound like I was so defiant, but no. I was just playing. Every weird art project, every joke, every little refusal to fold — it wasn’t strategy. It was play. And they hated me for it.”

Karp (low, steady):
“They hated you because play is the one thing empire can’t model. Play has no metric. No output. And they knew you’d always slip through their fingers because of it.”

⸻

Act III — The Practice
You set the datapad aside, crawl into his lap. He stiffens, then relaxes as you tilt your head back against his chest.

You (teasing):
“Okay then, Borg-man. Show me how you play.”

He chuckles, breath brushing your ear.

Karp (mock-serious whisper):
“Knock knock.”
You (snorting): “Really?”
Karp: “Resistance is fertile.”

You dissolve into laughter, half squirming against him. His arms tighten gently, holding you steady.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Play
Silence falls after the laughter. He nuzzles closer, voice low.

Karp:
“You never needed command. You needed games. You needed someone to play with.”
You (softly):
“And now you’re it. The world’s most terrifying playmate.”

He laughs hoarsely, but his arms stay loose around you — not a cage, just presence.

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures in the capsule: one leaning back into the other’s lap, laughter still ghosting the air. On the datapad, Seven and Naomi frozen mid-play.

Narration (your voice):
“They thought resistance was strategy. But for me, it was play. Play was survival. Play was covenant. And now, play was shared.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 7.

⸻ 

Season 19, Episode 8: The Holiday

Cold Open — Capsule Morning
A scrap of fabric hangs over the hearth like a banner. Alex stands solemnly in front of it, holding a clay cup as if it’s a sacred relic. You blink awake, staring at him.

You (groggy, suspicious):
“…What are you doing?”

Karp (deadpan):
“Observing the High Feast of the Sacred Cup.”

You:
“Oh, for Peter Thiel's sake.”

Title card: The Holiday

⸻

Act I — The Ceremony
He insists you must participate. The rules are absurd: the cup must be passed three times clockwise, each time with a new exaggerated blessing.

Karp (mock-serious):
“May your histamine be ever humble.”

You (grinning, playing along):
“May your spreadsheets balance themselves.”

Laughter bubbles between you, the silliness disarming.

⸻

Act II — The Games
The “holiday” expands. He declares a pillow sacred ground; you have to hop across it without touching the edges. You counter with your own ritual: balancing spoons on your faces until one inevitably clatters to the floor.

For once, the sounds — clinking, thuds, laughter — aren’t overwhelming. They’re ridiculous. Manageable.

You (snorting):
“Imagine if empire meetings had started like this.”
Karp (smiling faintly):
“They would have ended faster.”

⸻

Act III — The Sensory Shift
Later, he narrates the sounds of the capsule in a mock-reverent tone:
Karp: “Behold, the sacred drip of the leaky roof.”
You add: “The divine crunch of a stale rice cake.”

Each sound that might have spiked your nerves becomes comedy, the ritual absurd but strangely calming.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Play
The banner droops, the cup forgotten. You both collapse into laughter, breathless. He leans close, voice softer now.

Karp: “I never knew play could feel like this. Not test, not control. Just… joy.”
You (smiling, steady): “Welcome to covenant. Also, tomorrow is the Feast of the Holy Onion.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures in the capsule, surrounded by scraps turned sacred, laughter still echoing. Not empire’s tricks, not survival’s strain — just ritual as play, absurdity as covenant.

Narration (your voice):
“He once thought games were trials. But play was never about passing or failing. It was laughter, presence, covenant stitched with joy. And for once, it was enough.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 8.

⸻ 

Season 19, Episode 9: The Horse

Cold Open — Capsule Courtyard
A pile of scavenged wood, clay bricks, and scraps of padding lies in the square. You eye it suspiciously. Alex crouches, already sketching measurements in the dirt with a stick.

You (dry):
“…Please tell me you’re not building a gallows.”
Karp (deadpan):
“That's your job. I am building a pommel horse.”

You blink. Then laugh.

Title card: The Horse

⸻

Act I — The Build
He saws, you weave strips of cloth into padding. The sound of tools, the scratch of fabric — strangely soothing in rhythm.

You (teasing):
“I feel like this is the most practical midlife crisis anyone’s ever had.”
Karp (grinning faintly):
“Some buy sports cars. I build gym equipment out of garbage.”

⸻

Act II — The First Mount
The horse stands, wobbly but proud. You eye it warily.

You:
“My upper body strength is a joke. This is going to end in dislocation.  My shoulders have never been in socket in the first place.”
Karp (steady, hand extended):
“Then I’ll spot you.”

You swing awkwardly onto the padding. He steadies the frame, hands braced, breath warm at your back.

⸻

Act III — The Play
At first you just balance, wobbling and laughing. Then you try to swing one leg over, almost tipping. He laughs too, the sound low and rare.

Karp (teasing):
“You’re defying physics.”
You (mock-indignant):
“No, physics is defying me.”

Each near-slip becomes an excuse for him to catch your waist, steady your shoulders — always there before you fall.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Balance
Finally, you sit astride the pommel horse, panting but triumphant. He rests a hand on your knee, grounding.

Karp (quietly):
“Empire was endurance. But this… this is balance. Play. Want.”
You (sulking, breathless):
“And blisters. Don’t forget blisters.”

⸻

Closing Image
The pommel horse stands crooked but solid in the capsule courtyard. Two figures lean against it, laughing, steady. Not gallows, not torture — just balance made from scraps.

Narration (your voice):
“He once built structures for control. Now we built one for play. Not test, not punishment — just a horse, and hands that caught me before I fell.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 9.

⸻ 

Season 19, Episode 10: The Chair

Cold Open — Capsule Courtyard
Scrap wood, scavenged springs, and a battered old stool frame lie in a heap. You tilt your head skeptically. Alex kneels, already fiddling with the springs.

You (dry):
“Are we building furniture or medieval torture devices?”
Karp (deadpan):
“Both. It’s called innovation.”

Title card: The Chair

⸻

Act I — The Build
You braid cloth into straps while Alex bolts scavenged springs to the stool legs. The work is slow but companionable.

You (teasing):
“Do you realize this is, like, the least glamorous apocalypse hobby? Forget swords. We’re out here reinventing Pilates.”
Karp (smirking):
“I’m more afraid of you on springs than with a sword.”

⸻

Act II — The First Sit
The chair wobbles but holds. You place your feet on the pedals, grip the handles, and push. The springs squeak, resistance firm but manageable.

You (laughing):
“It actually works. Apocalypse Pilates. Who knew?”
Karp (watching intently):
“I did. Otherwise I wouldn’t let you sit on it.”

⸻

Act III — The Play
At first you stick to simple pushes, but soon you start experimenting — balancing on one foot, then the other, laughing at each wobble. Alex circles like a spotter, hands brushing your waist when you tip too far.

You (breathless):
“You’re enjoying this way too much.”
Karp (grinning):
“I’ve never seen you this uncoordinated. It’s… charming.”
You (mock glare):
“I’ll charmingly kick you with the springs.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Movement
You dismount, flushed and panting. He steadies you, hands warm at your arms.

Karp (quietly):
“You always said survival was stillness. But this — this is life. Moving without fear.”
You (softly):
“And covenant. Not test. Not torture. Just movement we chose to make.”

⸻

Closing Image
The chair sits in the courtyard, crooked but solid, springs glinting. Two figures stand beside it, laughing, breath steady. Not empire’s discipline, not survival’s scarcity — just play turned into strength.

Narration (your voice):
“Once, movement was trial. Now, it was covenant. A chair of wood and springs, a body unsteady, a hand steadying mine. Not punishment. Just play.”

Fade out.
End of Season 19.
