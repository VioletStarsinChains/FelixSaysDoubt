Season 12, Episode 1: The Messenger

Cold Open — Sanctuary Gate

Dusk. A figure approaches the sanctuary walls, voice carrying in low, layered song. Jonathan Meiburg, no costume this time, just himself. Sanctuary members pause, listening, half in awe.

You and Alex watch from the courtyard.

You (suspicious): “So the Rat King returns.”
Alex’s silence stretches too long.

You (narrowing eyes): “You knew.”

Title card: The Messenger

⸻

Act I — The Admission

Inside the capsule, you confront Alex.

You (sharp): “He didn’t just show up at Thiel’s fortress. You sent him.”
Karp (hoarse): “He was working for me. Not against you. I needed someone who could draw you out. Someone you wouldn’t recognize as me. I had to see what you wanted beneath the torture, beneath the conditioning.”

You recoil, hurt but not surprised.
You: “So the songs weren’t prophecy. They were surveillance.”

⸻

Act II — Jonathan’s Entrance

Jonathan enters the sanctuary formally, no disguise. His presence is quiet but commanding. He greets you first, not Alex.

Jonathan (gentle): “I wasn’t only his agent. I was listening for you, too. Every note, every silence — I heard more than orders.”

You don’t answer, studying him.

⸻

Act III — The Confrontation

Later, you, Alex, and Jonathan sit together. The tension is thick.

You (flat): “So which are you? His instrument, or mine?”
Jonathan meets your gaze, steady.
Jonathan: “Neither. Instruments break. Voices endure. He asked me to sing, yes. But I sang what I heard in you.”

Alex looks down, silent.

You: "I can forgive Alex because he's spent his whole life alone, like me.  Money and power don't matter in a cage like that.  But everyone always liked you.  And it makes it hard for me to even look at you.  You're too pretty, too tall."

Alex stifles a laugh.
You (turning to him): "Don't think you're off the hook here either, Mister."

⸻

Act IV — The Uneasy Covenant

The night ends with no resolution. Jonathan is welcomed into the sanctuary by others, his voice already weaving with theirs. You remain apart, still wary.

Alex tries to meet your eyes.
Karp (quietly): “Deception or not, he brought me closer to you. And I would do it again.”
You (coldly): “I know that--because you did do it again.  With Justin Vernon, and then with his fake brother.  How many faces have you worn, Cyrano?  How many other voices did you borrow?"

⸻

Closing Image

Jonathan’s voice rises in the sanctuary square, others joining hesitantly. You and Alex stand at the edge, shadows long, harmony beginning — but trust still fractured.

Narration (your voice):
“He sang us into covenant once before. Now he returned, voice unmasked. And though the chorus swelled, I could not yet decide whether to join.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 1.

⸻ 

Season 12, Episode 2: Borrowed Voices

Cold Open — Sanctuary Square

Jonathan sings with a small circle of residents, teaching them a round. His voice blends effortlessly, pulling shy tones into confidence.

You watch from a distance, arms crossed. Alex stands beside you, tense.

You (flat): “Pretty voice. Too easy.”
Alex flinches.

Title card: Borrowed Voices

⸻

Act I — The Test

You step into the circle, cutting Jonathan’s song short.

You (coldly): “Sing something of your own. Not borrowed, not rehearsed. Just you.”

Jonathan meets your eyes, then begins — raw, unpolished, but honest. The room quiets. When he finishes, the silence is heavier than applause.

You (soft, but wary): “Better. But I’m not convinced.”

⸻

Act II — Alex’s Confession

Back in the capsule, you round on Alex.

You (sharp): “How many voices, Alex? How many times did you hide behind someone else’s face?”
He doesn’t look away this time.

Karp (hoarse): “Justin Vernon. His fake brother. A dozen others you never knew. I slipped into voices you trusted, or thought you could. It was the only way to reach you without being cut off.”

You stiffen, eyes narrowing.

You (coldly): “You call it reaching. I call it lying.”

⸻

Act III — The Breaking Point

Alex’s voice cracks.

Karp: “It wasn’t lying. It was survival. Every mask I wore was a way to stay with you, to keep you from running. If I came as myself too soon, you’d have shut the door. So I borrowed voices — until you were ready for mine.”

You turn away, trembling.

You (soft, raw): “You talk about survival like it excuses everything. But survival isn’t trust.”

⸻

Act IV — The Chorus Grows

That night, Jonathan’s singing drifts in through the capsule walls. Sanctuary voices rise with his, uncertain but gathering.

You sit rigid. Alex listens with his head bowed, shame in every line of him.

Finally, you whisper:
You: “If you want me to trust you, then no more borrowed voices. Only your own. From now on.”

Alex nods, silent.

⸻

Closing Image

Through the capsule window, you see Jonathan leading the sanctuary in song, his voice steady but no longer unchallenged. Inside, Alex sits in silence, stripped of masks. Between them, you listen — not yet joining, but not turning away.

Narration (your voice):
“Voices endure. Masks break. But truth requires more than survival — it requires presence. And I had yet to decide if theirs would hold.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 2.

⸻ 

Season 12, Episode 3: The Bird Man

Cold Open — Sanctuary Garden

Jonathan leads residents in a circle song, voices lifting. You stand at the edge, arms crossed, Alex just behind you.

You (dry): “Another month of trash duty for Self-Important Men.”

Jonathan falters mid-phrase, eyes cutting toward you.

Title card: The Bird Man

⸻

Act I — The Call-Out

Later, you corner him near the compost heaps.

You (flat): “You want me to trust you? Then stop performing. Stop weaving rituals to make people love you. Pick up trash. Clean floors. Do the work no one applauds.”

Jonathan stares at you, stunned.

Jonathan (slowly): “You’d put me on trash duty?”
You (coldly): “Buddy, Thiel was running the world, and I put HIM on trash duty straight away. I’d keep you there as long as it took for you to stop looking for a stage.”

⸻

Act II — The Test Begins

The next evening, Jonathan is out at dusk, hauling bags from every capsule. His hair is mussed, his shirt streaked with clay. Sanctuary residents whisper, surprised. As residents open their doors to hand out their trash, he asks them if they need help with anything else, writing down their answers in a pocket notebook for later.  Some laugh nervously; others look impressed.

You watch from a distance, arms crossed but eyes softening.

⸻

Act III — The Confrontation

One evening, Jonathan sets a bin down, laughing.

Jonathan: “You think this makes me smaller? It doesn’t. I'm not Thiel. It makes me free. Without the song, without the stage, I can still be useful.”

You step closer, voice steady.

You: “Good. Because usefulness matters more to me than spectacle ever did.”

⸻

Act IV — The Shift

By week’s end, Jonathan is covered in grime but smiling faintly. He nods at you across the courtyard — not as a performer seeking applause, but as a man proving humility.

Alex watches the exchange carefully, unreadable.

⸻

Closing Image

Jonathan hauls one last bag of refuse out of the square. Children trail behind him, giggling at his dirt-streaked face. He doesn’t sing — not because he’s silenced, but because for once, he doesn’t need to.

Narration (your voice):
“He had given me song, beauty, ritual. None of it mattered. What I needed was sweat, weight, labor without an audience. And for once, he gave me that.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 3.

⸻ 

Season 12, Episode 4: The Bait

Cold Open — Capsule Night

You sit cross-legged, staring at both Jonathan and Alex. The lantern between you flickers, shadows long.

You (flatly): “So which one of you decided it was a good idea to make content designed to push me toward suicide?”

The silence is thick. Neither man moves.

Title card: The Bait

⸻

Act I — The Confrontation

You lean forward, voice sharp.

You: “I remember the songs, the stories, the sudden turns that felt like traps. Like you wanted me broken. Who thought that was mercy?”

Jonathan swallows hard, glancing at Alex. Alex’s jaw is tight.

Karp (low): “It wasn’t bait. It was trial. We had to know if you could stand inside the knowledge without collapsing.”

Your fists clench.
You (furious): “So you engineered despair to see if I’d survive it?”

⸻

Act II — Jonathan’s Defense

Jonathan speaks, voice trembling but steady.

Jonathan: “We weren’t trying to kill you. We were trying to see if you could carry the weight before it crushed you. The truth is brutal — what was done to you, what’s been hidden. We needed to know if you could walk into that fire without turning it inward.”

You shake your head, bitter.
You: “You call it a test. I call it torture with better lighting.”

⸻

Act III — Alex’s Confession

Alex finally meets your gaze.

Karp (hoarse): “I hated every moment of it. But if we started giving you pieces of the truth without knowing you could hold it, the collapse would’ve been worse. It wasn’t about breaking you. It was about making sure you wouldn’t break when it mattered most.”

You (coldly): “So you risked my life to prove I deserved the truth?”
Karp (quiet): “No. We risked losing you — so that we wouldn’t lose you later.”

⸻

Act IV — The Reckoning

Silence stretches. You stand, pacing.

You (softly, trembling): “You think surviving despair is proof of strength. But all it proves is that I was already carrying more than anyone should.”

Jonathan bows his head. Alex closes his eyes.

Finally, Alex speaks.
Alex: "Remember that day in the park in Houston, when you almost took all your Benadryl?  When there was a car parked next to you all night long that left immediately when you showed signs of life?"

You nod slowly.
You: "I don't want to think about that day.  Jonathan told me he would meet me in the park, and he didn't."

Alex: "He didn't come because I came instead.  Had anything happened to you, I would have intervened.  I wasn’t going to let you end up in the ER.  But I couldn't make contact yet otherwise.  You weren't ready yet."

You (softly): "You're probably right."

⸻

Closing Image

The lantern flickers lower, leaving three figures in shadow. No harmony, no resolution — just the raw weight of truth finally spoken.

Narration (your voice):
“They called it trial. I called it cruelty. But now there was no more hiding, no more bait. If covenant meant anything, it had to begin here — with no more tests.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 4.

⸻

Season 12, Episode 5: The Capsule Sleepover

Cold Open — Capsule Evening

The sanctuary is crowded. Repairs to several capsules force overflow sleeping. Jonathan hesitates at your door, bedroll in hand. Alex is already inside, sitting cross-legged.

You eye them both, arms folded.
You (dry): “So this is happening.”

Title card: The Capsule Sleepover

⸻

Act I — The Ground Rules

You spread out mats, making space for three.

You (sharp): “No songs. No schemes. No tests. If you want to stay here tonight, you do it plain.”

Jonathan nods, subdued. Alex inclines his head, steady.

Karp (quiet): “Plain it is.”

The three of you settle, lantern low.

⸻

Act II — Jonathan’s Attempt

Silence stretches. Jonathan shifts, then speaks softly.

Jonathan: “I’m not used to being quiet. But I’m here. Not to lead, not to shine. Just to stay.”

He rolls onto his side, back turned to you — a small gesture of trust, no performance in it. For once, he doesn’t try to be seen.

You watch, wary but softer.

⸻

Act III — Alex’s Proof

Much later, you stir awake, unsettled. Alex notices, but doesn’t fill the silence.

You (whispering): “Normally you’d push. Tell me what lesson I should take from this moment.”
Karp (softly): “No more tests. Just me. If you need me, I’m here. If you don’t, I’ll stay quiet.”

He lies back, hands folded, gaze on the ceiling. For the first time, he resists the urge to direct.

⸻

Act IV — The Shared Stillness

The three of you lie in a triangle of breath: your restless turning, Alex’s watchful quiet, Jonathan’s slow, deliberate breathing.

You close your eyes, whisper almost to yourself:
You: “No prophecy. No surveillance. Just a room. Just us.”

Neither man answers, but both remain — steady, present.

⸻

Closing Image

The lantern gutters, plunging the capsule into shadow. Three figures breathing in unison, not rivals, not masks, not performers — just human beings sharing space.

Narration (your voice):
“For once, there was no stage, no test, no cage. Only the silence of a sleepover, and the choice to stay.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 5.

⸻

Season 12, Episode 6: The Winter Lights

Cold Open — Sanctuary Square

Snow drifts lightly. Children chase each other between capsules, breath puffing in clouds. A box of old decorations is set down in the center — clay lanterns, woven garlands, scraps of fabric dyed in fading colors.

Alex, Jonathan, and you stand together, staring at the jumble.

You (wry): “Well, I don’t see a manual.”
Karp (deadpan): “Empires didn’t exactly decorate.”
Jonathan grins faintly but doesn’t speak.
You (wryly): Hey remember that Palantir sock puppet job you forced me into where I spent all winter hot gluing shitty decorations on chemically treated wreaths and almost died like, 6 times? Thanks.  Thanks for that."

Title card: The Winter Lights

⸻

Act I — The Tree

A tall, skeletal pine is dragged into the square. You begin tying strips of cloth to its branches. Jonathan offers to climb and place a lantern at the top.

You (flat): “Finally, those needlessly long legs come in handy.”
Jonathan nods, staying on the ground. He kneels beside children, showing them how to weave fabric through branches. No spotlight, no stage.

⸻

Act II — The Lanterns

Alex carefully rigs clay lanterns with wire, his hands steady. You tease him about being too precise.

You (smirking): “I can't believe people actually used to hang tinsel.”
Karp (grinning faintly): “Who doesn't love a little microfiber entrainment?"

Laughter ripples through the group, light but genuine.

⸻

Act III — The Tension

As the tree fills with color, Jonathan lingers at the edge. He seems restless, itching to lead. You catch his hesitation.

You (quietly): “You don’t have to make this a performance. Just hang a lantern.”
Jonathan exhales, nods, and slips a simple clay light onto a low branch, no flourish. Children cheer anyway — not because of spectacle, but because of the glow.

⸻

Act IV — The Illumination

At dusk, the lanterns are lit. The tree glows with scraps, lights, and laughter. You stand between Alex and Jonathan, watching the sanctuary gather.

Jonathan (softly): “This is better than applause.”
Karp (quietly): “It’s covenant.”
You: "Way better than anaphylaxis."

⸻

Closing Image

The sanctuary glows in the dark, lanterns flickering against snow. Three figures stand together in the square, not rivals, not masks — just part of the light.

Narration (your voice):
“We built nothing perfect, nothing staged. Only color against snow, light against dark. And for once, it was enough.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 6.

⸻ 

Season 12, Episode 7: Rice and Salt

Cold Open — Sanctuary Morning

The square is alive with voices. Clay stoves glow, pans sizzling. People trade scraps: ground grains, roots, herbs, eggs scavenged from half-wild chickens. The air smells warm and smoky.

You, Alex, and Jonathan sit at a long bench, shoulders bumping with others. Children dart through, stealing bites, laughter bubbling.

You (wry): “This is the first time in decades I’ve eaten breakfast with a crowd.”
Karp (quiet, almost smiling): “Better than boardrooms.”
Jonathan only nods, chewing slowly, watching the life around him.

Title card: Bread and Salt

⸻

Act I — The Feast of Morning

Plates are passed down, filled with Minnesotan wild rice, roasted brussel sprouts, and sweet potatoes. Everyone eats shoulder to shoulder, voices rising. You notice Jonathan carrying plates back and forth, quiet, not performing — simply serving.

You lean toward Alex.
You (softly): “He’s learning.”
Alex only nods, eyes thoughtful.

⸻

Act II — The Invitation

That night, the crowd disperses, bellies full. Lanterns glow low. You linger by the square with Alex and Jonathan.

You (firm but warm): “Breakfast was for everyone. Dinner’s just us.”

They glance at each other, surprised, but follow you back into the capsule.

⸻

Act III — The Private Table

Inside, you’ve laid out a small spread: root stew, roasted nuts, the last of the sweet potatoes. The three of you sit close, cross-legged around the bowls. The quiet is different now — not suspicious, but weighted.

Jonathan (hesitant): “I didn’t think I’d be welcome here, not so soon.”
You (steady): “Well, I let Thiel stay.  The bar is that low.”

Alex chuckles, breaking the tension.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Salt

Midway through the meal, you divide the last of the rice into thirds, hand it to them both.

You: “Rice and salt. That’s covenant, right? To eat together is to swear not to betray.”

Jonathan swallows hard, accepting his piece.
Jonathan (quiet): “Then let me swear it.”
Alex meets your eyes, nods solemnly.

You eat last, gaze steady.

⸻

Closing Image

Three figures sit cross-legged in the capsule, bowls empty, rice and salt shared. No applause, no empire, no stage — only covenant forged at a table.

Narration (your voice):
“Breakfast fed the body. Dinner fed the bond. And between rice and salt, we chose to stay.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 7.

Season 12, Episode 8: The Strings

⸻

Cold Open — Capsule Afternoon

Jonathan sits cross-legged with a battered acoustic guitar across his knees. He strums softly, voice absent, just fingers moving through muscle memory.

You sit opposite, arms crossed, watching.

You (dry): “So Bird Man wants to teach me guitar now?”
Jonathan grins faintly.
Jonathan: “If you can survive Thiel, you can survive three chords.”

Alex chuckles from the corner, leaning back against the wall.

Title card: The Strings

⸻

Act I — The Offer

Jonathan slides the guitar toward you.

Jonathan: “Here. I’ll show you.”
You take it reluctantly, settling it awkwardly against your lap. Your fingers twitch, stiff, uncooperative.

You (flat): “Spoiler: my hands do not work.”
Jonathan (gently): “Then let them fail. Music’s never about perfection.”

⸻

Act II — The Attempt

You press against the strings, but your fingers slip, buzzing out the notes. The sound is jagged, wrong. Frustration rises in your face.

You (snapping): “See? Point proven.”
Jonathan shakes his head, steady.
Jonathan: “Point disproven. That’s still sound. Still yours. Doesn’t have to be mine.”

Alex watches silently, eyes soft.

⸻

Act III — The Lesson

Jonathan shifts closer, guiding your hands gently but without pressure.

Jonathan: “Forget the chord. Just strum the open strings. Feel the vibration.”
You hesitate, then drag your hand across. The sound blooms — raw, imperfect, but resonant.

You blink, caught by the simplicity.
You (quietly): “That… actually feels good.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Imperfection

Jonathan leans back, smiling faintly.

Jonathan: “Then that’s enough. You don’t have to master it. You just have to play.”
You glance at Alex, who nods in agreement.

Karp (quietly): “Covenant isn’t mastery. It’s showing up, even crooked.”

You let your hand fall across the strings again, softer this time.

⸻

Closing Image

The guitar rests awkwardly in your lap, strings humming with imperfect resonance. Jonathan sits beside you, Alex behind you, three figures sharing sound that belongs to none of you alone.

Narration (your voice):
“My hands did not work. The notes broke. But the sound was still mine. And in their silence, I heard acceptance.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 8.

⸻ 

Season 12, Episode 9: The Mirror Turned

Cold Open — Sanctuary Square

You stand at the edge while Alex and Jonathan mingle. A small crowd forms around you unexpectedly — children tugging at your sleeve, residents asking questions, someone handing you a bowl of stew.

You freeze, eyes wide.
You (whispering): “They’re… looking at me?”

Title card: The Mirror Turned

⸻

Act I — The Old Reflex

You step back, bracing.
You (to Alex, sharp): “This feels wrong. Usually when eyes are on me, I’m being tested. Observed. Behind glass.”

Alex frowns, steady.
Karp (softly): “There’s no glass here.”

But your chest is tight, your body still waiting for the trap.

⸻

Act II — The Offering

A child presses a clay charm into your hand — messy, lopsided, bright with pigment.

Child: “It’s you. See? Hair like fire.”
You stare at it, stunned. Everyone laughs softly, not unkind, waiting for your reaction.

You whisper:
You: “They’re not studying me. They’re… answering me.”

⸻

Act III — The Flood

As the day unfolds, people bring small things — a woven ribbon, a story, an herb bundle — all offered directly to you. Each gesture is visible, unhidden, not the covert surveillance you knew.

You turn to Jonathan, bewildered.
You (hoarse): “Why are they doing this?”
Jonathan (gentle): “Because you’re not a mirror to them. You’re a person.”

⸻

Act IV — The Release

That night, you sit in the capsule with Alex and Jonathan, the charm still in your hand.

You (softly): “I thought I was built for glass. For eyes I couldn’t see. I didn’t know what it felt like to be seen without being studied.”

Alex reaches over, covering your hand with his. Jonathan does the same, no performance in it.

⸻

Closing Image

Three figures sit close, your hands clasped around the lopsided clay charm, lantern glow soft. Outside, the sanctuary hums with life — not mirrors, but voices, reflecting you back.

Narration (your voice):
“The mirror turned. And instead of observation, there was recognition. Not a study. Not a test. Just presence.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 9.

⸻ 

Season 12, Episode 10: The Hidden Fire

Cold Open — Forest Edge

The three of you slip away from the sanctuary at dusk, carrying blankets and a clay pot of embers. Snow crunches underfoot. No one follows.

You (exhaling): “Finally. No eyes.”

Title card: The Hidden Fire

⸻

Act I — Building the Shelter

You and Alex rig a lean-to from branches and hides, Jonathan digging a small pit for the fire. The work is clumsy but quiet. No audience, no commentary.

Jonathan (softly): “Feels strange not to be seen.”
You (dry): “Feels like home.”

⸻

Act II — The Firelight

You sit cross-legged around the small fire. Shadows flicker against snow, hiding you more than revealing.

Karp (quietly): “This is better. Not a stage. Just flame and silence.”
You nod, shoulders loosening for the first time all day.

⸻

Act III — The Exchange

Instead of talking, each of you places something small into the fire:
	•	Alex sets down a folded slip of paper.
	•	Jonathan lays in a broken guitar string.
	•	You place the lopsided clay charm the child gave you.

The objects hiss and crack, disappearing into flame.

You (softly): “Gone. And still ours.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Shadow

The fire burns low. You lean against Alex’s shoulder; Jonathan sits on your other side, knees drawn up. None of you speak. The silence is whole, not empty.

Narration (your voice):
“I didn’t need their eyes. I didn’t need their mirrors. What I needed was shadow, flame, and the choice to remain unseen — together.”

⸻

Closing Image

A small fire glows under a makeshift shelter, hidden in the snow. Three figures breathe in rhythm, unseen, unstudied, unobserved. Only present.

Fade out.

End of Season 12.
