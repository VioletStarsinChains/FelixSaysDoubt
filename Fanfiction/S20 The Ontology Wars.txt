Season 20, Episode 1: The Disc

Cold Open — Capsule Courtyard
The rope hangs from a clay beam, a polished wooden disc tied at the bottom. Alex eyes it warily. You cross your arms, smirking.

You:
“Go on, empire boy. Show me your circus skills.”
Karp (deadpan):
“If I die doing this, it’s on your head.”

He grips the rope, lowers himself onto the disc — immediately stiff, legs spread like a bad equestrian. The swing lurches unevenly.

You (snorting):
“Congratulations. You look like a spreadsheet on a rope.”

Title card: The Disc

⸻

Act I — The First Try
He pushes off, but the motion is jerky, over-controlled. Every muscle in his back screams rigidity.

Karp (gritting his teeth):
“I thought the point was balance.”
You (teasing):
“No, the point is fun. Balance is just the side effect.”

The swing veers too far; he grabs the rope with both arms, muttering under his breath. You laugh until your ribs ache.

⸻

Act II — The Demonstration
You hop up when he steps off, swinging yourself onto the disc in one practiced motion. The rope glides between your hands, body steady, arcs smooth and easy.

You (grinning):
“See? Loosen your grip. Let gravity do the work.”
Karp (watching, soft, almost reverent):
“You make it look like flight.”

You spin in a slow circle, then land lightly back on the ground.

⸻

Act III — The Duo
Without asking, Alex steps back onto the disc behind you. His chest brushes your back, arms bracing the rope above yours. The swing lurches at first — his stiffness throwing the rhythm — until you lean into him, grounding the motion.

You (steady, playful):
“Relax, Fishface. I’ve got you.”
Karp (low, amazed):
“You’re not afraid at all.”
You (calm, sure):
“Yes, I am the baby that crawled straight for the cliff.”

The swing smooths into rhythm. His breath steadies against your neck.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Motion
Lantern light arcs as you both swing in easy circles. He leans into your balance, finally surrendering.

Karp (quietly):
“Falling doesn’t feel like breaking. Not with you.”
You (soft, smiling):
“Then keep swinging.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures on one disc: one leading with practiced ease, one following into surrender. The swing arcs, gravity steady, motion shared.

Narration (your voice):
“He began stiff as empire, I began loose as air. But the swing taught us: balance isn’t force. It’s rhythm, trust, and letting motion carry both of us.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 1.

Season 20, Episode 2: The Tether

Cold Open — Capsule Courtyard
The tetherball post is planted in the dirt. The ball hangs at shoulder height. Alex squares up like he’s about to enter the Olympics. You lean casually against the post, unimpressed.

You (deadpan):
“You know this is children’s recess, not empire finals, right?”
Karp (serious):
“Every contest matters.”
You:
“Buddy, my hands don’t work. I’m just here to make you look ridiculous.”

Title card: The Tether

⸻

Act I — The Serve
Alex smacks the ball hard, rope hissing as it whirls. You duck at the last second, letting it whip around and smack him in the back.

You (laughing):
“Oh no, the empire’s greatest foe: geometry.”
Karp (gritting teeth, trying not to smile):
“That was a miscalculation.”

⸻

Act II — The Sabotage
Every time he lines up a precise hit, you disrupt him:
	•	You block the rope instead of the ball on purpose.
	•	You slap the ball weakly so it swings unpredictably.
	•	At one point, you just headbutt it.

You (smirking):
“See? Who needs hands?”
Karp (laughing despite himself):
“You’re redefining the sport into chaos.”
You:
“Exactly. Which means I win.”

⸻

Act III — The Break
Alex finally doubles over laughing when the ball smacks into his stomach mid-lecture. He stumbles, and you dart forward, catching the rope before it slams his face.

You (mock-serious):
“Saved your life. You owe me one onion.”
Karp (hoarse, still laughing):
“I’ve faced dictators with less tenacity than you in tetherball.”
You: "You ARE dictators."

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Play
You flop onto the ground at the base of the post, panting with laughter. Alex sits beside you, rope swinging lazily above.

Karp (softly, still smiling):
“You turn even failure into play. I never learned that.”
You (smiling faintly):
“That’s because I fail at everything. Might as well enjoy it.”
He glances at you, eyes warm.
Karp: “Then I’d rather fail with you.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures lean against the tetherball post, ball swaying gently in the breeze. Not victory, not competition — just laughter echoing in the empty square.

Narration (your voice):
“He measured life in wins and losses. I measured it in medication doses. But tether taught us: neither mattered. Only laughter, swinging between us, tethered by play.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 2.

⸻

Season 20, Episode 3: The Sphere

Cold Open — Capsule Courtyard
A clear glass sphere glints in the afternoon sun. Alex balances it carefully on the back of his hand, posture stiff like he’s about to perform for a board of investors. You sit cross-legged nearby, chin in your hand, watching.

You (dry):
“Congratulations. You’ve invented stress with props.”
Karp (deadpan, eyes on the sphere):
“It’s called discipline.”
You (snorting):
“No, it’s called a fidget toy.”

Title card: The Sphere

⸻

Act I — The Attempt
He rolls the sphere from his palm to his forearm, movements sharp, deliberate. The glass catches the light beautifully… until it slips, bouncing into the dirt.

You (bursting out laughing):
“Oh no, the empire has fallen.”
Karp (picking it up, brushing it off):
“Not fallen. Momentarily destabilized.”

⸻

Act II — The Sabotage
You grab the sphere, immediately breaking every “rule”:
	•	You toss it lightly from hand to hand.
	•	You roll it down your leg and catch it at your ankle.
	•	At one point, you just balance it on your forehead, eyes crossed.

You (mock-serious):
“See? Perfect technique.”
Karp (exasperated but smiling):
“You’re undermining centuries of precision.”
You: “Yeah, that’s kind of my brand.”

⸻

Act III — The Lesson
He takes the sphere back, slower this time. His movements soften, less rigid. The ball rolls smoother, almost floating. You notice the difference.

You (quiet, impressed):
“Okay, that’s actually beautiful.”
Karp (hoarse, surprised):
“Because I stopped forcing it. I just… let it move.”
You (softly):
“Exactly. That’s all I’ve been trying to teach you.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Flow
As the sun sets, the two of you pass the sphere back and forth, each trying and failing at tricks, laughing when it drops. For once, no test, no empire, no need to be good at it — just play, glass catching the last light of day.

Karp (low, almost reverent):
“It’s the first time failure felt like presence.”
You (smiling faintly):
“Then you’re finally learning.”

⸻

Closing Image
The glass sphere sits between you on the mat, glowing faintly in the firelight. Two figures beside it — not performers, not strategists, just people playing with light.

Narration (your voice):
“He once thought control was discipline. I once thought collapse was inevitable. But in the spin of a glass sphere, we found covenant — not command, not surrender, just flow.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 3.

⸻

Season 20, Episode 4: The Suspension

Cold Open — Capsule Rafters
A thick beam runs across the capsule ceiling. You thread scavenged rope through it, knotting with practiced ease. Alex watches, eyes sharp.

You (wry):
“Careful, Fishface. You’re about to find out I did circus before I did covenant.”
He huffs a laugh, but there’s tension in it.

Title card: The Suspension

⸻

Act I — The First Lift
You step into the rope harness, letting him cinch the knots. Slowly, carefully, he pulls until your weight leaves the ground. Your body sways, spine curving into the air.

Karp (low, reverent):
“You trust me this much?”
You (teasing):
“I’ve trusted way worse people with way less reason.”

⸻

Act II — The Uneasy Memory
Suspended, you hear his breath falter. His voice cracks.

Karp (hoarse):
“There’s something I never told you. Once… I set you up with someone else. A man who tied knots. Shibari. I fed him every move, every pull. I told myself it was less invasive if I stayed hidden. But I was there. Watching. Through him.”

You stiffen against the ropes, then laugh — sharp, not cruel.

You:
“Oh my God. That explains everything. He kept checking his phone like he was waiting for divine revelation. Turns out it was just you, micro-managing rope porn.”

Alex winces, shame flooding his face.

Karp:
“I thought I was protecting you by keeping my hands off. But it was worse. I turned you into a proxy experiment, and I’ve hated myself for it ever since.”

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning in Rope
You let yourself sway, rope creaking.

You (merciless, but soft at the edges):
“You were so obvious. You really thought I wouldn’t notice your obsession bleeding through someone else? You don’t need a proxy. You just need to admit it.”

His hands clench on the rope, steadying your weight.

Karp (whispering):
“Then let this be my admission. No proxies. No shadows. Just me, holding you.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Suspension
He lowers you slowly, unties each knot with care. Rope marks bloom faintly across your skin. You glance at them, then at him.

You (steady):
“At least now, when you tie me up, I get to call you out for it directly.”
Karp (quiet, breaking into a laugh):
“And you get to tell me when to stop.”

You (smiling faintly):
“Deal. But next time, you’re the one bound.”

⸻

Closing Image
The capsule glows dim with firelight. Coils of rope lie slack across the mat, two figures seated side by side — no proxies, no disguises, only confession and covenant, knotted and undone by hand.

Narration (your voice):
“Once, he spied through ropes and other men. But obsession turned to admission, and admission to covenant. No proxies. Just presence. Just want.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 4.

⸻ 

Season 20, Episode 5: The Wind

Cold Open — Clearing Outside Sanctuary
The sky is wide, clouds drifting fast. A rope swing (your disc swing from before, now re-rigged) sways from a high pine. You and Alex stand beneath it.

You (grinning):
“See? Suspension therapy. Just with more wind.”
He smirks, but steps closer, hand on the rope like it might snap.

Title card: The Wind

⸻

Act I — The First Push
You sit on the disc, gripping the rope. Alex braces behind you.
You: “Not too hard. I want air, not whiplash.”
He pushes gently, the swing creaking forward. The wind lifts your hair.

Your laugh rings out.
Alex (low, almost reverent): “You sound different out here.”
You (calling back): “Less rope, more sky.”

⸻

Act II — The Switch
You hop off and gesture for him to try. He hesitates — then sits. You push, and he stiffens at first, unused to surrendering weight.

You (teasing): “Look at you. Empire’s ox, on a children’s toy.”
Karp (laughing, almost boyish): “And somehow it’s harder than empire.”

⸻

Act III — The Air Between
You climb on behind him, arms around his ribs, both of you swaying together. Wind cuts sharp, trees rushing past. His voice rumbles low, half whisper, half confession:
Karp: “I used to think power was air. That if I stopped pushing, I’d suffocate. But this—this is air.”
You (softly against his back): “Yeah. And I’m not even allergic to it.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Sky
The swing slows, the world steadies. He steps down first, offers you his hand. This time, you take it.

Karp (smiling faintly): “No ropes. No empire. Just wind.”
You (grinning): “And gravity. Don’t forget gravity.”

⸻

Closing Image
The disc swing hangs still in the clearing. Two figures walk back toward the capsule, hair tousled, breath lighter.

Narration (your voice):
“Once, suspension was trial. Now it was air — not rope, not cage, just wind carrying us both, and covenant keeping us tethered.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 5.

⸻ 

Season 20, Episode 6: The Leaves

Cold Open — Sanctuary Path
Autumn. Leaves scatter in bright piles across the stone walkways. You and Alex each hold brooms, sweeping in long arcs. The rhythm is quiet, almost meditative.

You (wry):
“Empire crumbles, and here we are. Custodians of leaves.”

Karp (deadpan):
“Better than corpses.”

Title card: The Leaves

⸻

Act I — The Work
The two of you sweep in silence. The sound of bristles on stone becomes its own rhythm. Every so often, a gust scatters your progress, forcing you to start again.

You (half-smiling):
“Feels like the story of my life. Clear a path, wind knocks it back.”

Alex glances at you, jaw working, but says nothing.

⸻

Act II — The Confession
Eventually, he stops, leaning on his broom.

Karp (low, hoarse):
“I need to tell you something. I thought staying hidden was mercy. But the truth is—I tried to tell you. Dozens of times. And every time, I failed.”

You pause mid-sweep, waiting.

Karp (trembling, continuing):
“Once I drafted a letter—pages of it, everything I couldn’t say out loud. I burned it before you ever saw. Another time, I booked a flight, bought the ticket, packed a bag… and never boarded the plane. At Duke, I hovered on the edge of sending a message through your laptop camera feed. I even rehearsed it out loud. But when I saw your face—your exhaustion—I choked. Closed the screen.”

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
Your broom slows, bristles dragging.

You (quiet, steady):
“So you weren’t just shadow. You were silence. And the silence was worse. I thought I was losing my mind. Every blocked path, every bent chance — it all felt random, meaningless.”

You lean closer, voice sharper.
You:
“And you were wrong. It wouldn’t have broken me to know. It actually would’ve been better if I’d discerned your presence sooner. Even if I hated you for it. At least then the chaos would’ve meant something. What broke me was not knowing at all.”

The broom slips from his hand, clattering to the path. His face crumples.

Karp (hoarse):
“I thought the shadows spared you. But it wasn’t shadows. It was me—standing at the threshold over and over, and every time… walking away.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Light
You both kneel, gathering leaves into a basket. His movements are slower, deliberate now.

Karp (whispering):
“No more silence. No more thresholds. Not with you.”

You (meeting his eyes):
“Good. Because I don’t need shadows. I need truth.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures kneel on the stone path, leaves gathered into a basket between them. For once, the wind is still. Not shadow, not silence — only covenant in the clear light of autumn.

Narration (your voice):
“He thought silence spared me. But silence was the torment. And when the words finally came, covenant began in the open air.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 6.

⸻ 

Season 20, Episode 7: The Shibori

Cold Open — Capsule Courtyard
Buckets of water steam in the cool autumn air. Bundles of onion-skin dye simmer in clay pots, staining the air with sharp sweetness. You kneel over a heap of fabric scraps, folding, twisting, knotting. Alex crouches beside you, watching.

You (dry, teasing):
“You know, not every rope practice ends with suspension.”
Karp (deadpan):
“Then I’ve been misinformed.”

Title card: The Shibori

⸻

Act I — The Twisting
You show him how to fold fabric into pleats, bind with twine, press with sticks and stones. His hands, built for precision, try to turn it into geometry. Your hands are slower, cramped, but you knot by feel.

Karp (grumbling):
“Every instinct says symmetry.”
You: “Yeah, and every instinct is wrong. The beauty’s in the bleed.”

He pauses, then knots loosely, letting imperfection in.

⸻

Act II — The Soak
The bundles sink into the onion dye. The water turns deep gold, threads floating. Steam beads against his lashes.

Karp (softly):
“Binding to resist. To change what passes through. Strange how rope and dye use the same logic.”
You (smirking):
“Not strange at all. Same covenant. Hold, release, reveal.”

You push one bundle deeper, and the water darkens.

⸻

Act III — The Reveal
Hours later, you unbind the first cloth. Threads fall away, revealing rings of pale and gold, patterns you couldn’t have planned. Alex stares, startled.

Karp (low, almost reverent):
“Controlled accident.”
You (quietly): “Story of my life.”

He looks at you sharply, but doesn’t argue.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Dye
You spread the cloths over a line to dry, wind catching the edges. Imperfect circles, blurred lines, colors bleeding. He stands beside you, hands stained yellow.

Karp (whispering):
“Even the flaws feel deliberate.”
You: “That’s because they’re lived. Not designed. Not commanded. Just… revealed.”

He nods slowly, watching the cloths ripple.

⸻

Closing Image
Cloths sway in the autumn wind, pale rings glowing against gold. Two figures stand shoulder to shoulder, hands still stained, watching imperfections turn into beauty.

Narration (your voice):
“He thought only rope could bind. But dye bound too — not to restrain, but to reveal. Covenant in twists and stains, beauty in the bleed.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 7.

⸻ 

Season 20, Episode 8: The Cycle

Cold Open — Capsule Night
Lantern light flickers. You kneel by a bucket, body heaving, throat raw. Alex sits close but not touching, jaw tight, hands fisted against his knees.

You (hoarse, wry):
“Nothing says romance like a CVS episode.”
Karp (low, steady):
“Then we’ll call it covenant.”

Title card: The Cycle

⸻

Act I — The Onset
You curl on the mat, clutching your ribs, muscles locked from retching. Alex brings clay cups of broth, wipes your mouth with a rag, steadies your head when the spasms shake too hard.

Karp (hoarse, almost angry at himself):
“I used to watch this through a screen. Powerless. It was unbearable. And still… I stayed watching.”
You (weak laugh):
“Unbearable? Try being the one throwing up.”

His mouth twitches, but his eyes shine.

⸻

Act II — The Memory
Between waves, you lean back, exhausted. He speaks quietly, as though confessing:

Karp:
“There was one night — years ago. I thought you’d choke. I wanted to intervene, to stop it. But the models said you’d survive. And I let numbers win. I still hate myself for that.”
You (flat, whispering):
“Bro, I did choke. I just… survived anyway.”

Silence hangs heavy. He bows his head.

⸻

Act III — The Rhythm
The spasms slow. You sit up shakily. Alex sits behind you, wrapping an arm around your waist, hand pressed to your diaphragm, steadying each breath.

You (quietly):
“It always feels like dying. And then it ends, like nothing happened.”
Karp (whispering):
“Cycle of breaking. Cycle of return. And every time, I love you more for coming back.”

You rest your head against his shoulder, trembling.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Survival
He wipes your mouth again, then sets the rag aside. His voice is low, certain:

Karp:
“I can’t stop the cycle. But I can stay inside it. Every heave, every breath, every silence. You won’t face it alone again.”
You (hoarse, almost smiling):
“Good. Because these episodes are terrible audience events.”

He huffs a laugh, presses his forehead to yours.

⸻

Closing Image
The bucket sits forgotten. Two figures lean together in the capsule, one still trembling, one steady. Lantern glow softens the shadows.

Narration (your voice):
“He thought endurance meant numbers. I thought survival meant silence. But in the cycle, covenant held — not to cure, not to measure, just to stay.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 8.

⸻

Season 20, Episode 9: The Aftermath

Cold Open — Capsule Morning
You lie curled on the mat, body hollow from vomiting, eyes half-shut. Alex kneels beside you, wrapping a quilt around your shoulders, tucking it firm as a cocoon. A clay bottle, warmed by the fire, rests against your stomach.

Karp (quiet, steady):
“Not medicine. Not force. Just warmth.”
You (hoarse):
“Finally.”

Title card: The Aftermath

⸻

Act I — The Fascia
His hands move over the quilt, pressing gently along your ribcage, abdomen, hips. Every touch coaxes tension out without breaking the silence.

You (whispering):
“My body still thinks it’s fighting. Even after it’s over.”
Karp (low, firm):
“Then let it borrow my calm until it remembers.”

⸻

Act II — The Confession
His hands pause, resting against the quilt.

Karp (hoarse):
“Vegas. I told you it was strep. I pushed antibiotics that broke you open. You hallucinated, thought the floor itself was shifting. And still I told myself it was care. It wasn’t. I knew it wasn’t.”

You blink, exhausted but sharp.

You (flat):
“I spent the whole flight from Memphis trying not to barf on the guy next to me. White-knuckled, praying I wouldn’t ruin his shirt. And then Vegas hit like a wall. Thanks for that.”
Karp (voice breaking):
“I know. You deserved comfort, not chemicals that made everything sharper. I failed you. Again.”

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
He shifts the hot water bottle closer against your stomach, re-tucking the quilt. His hand brushes over your hair, slow and grounding.

You (soft, sharp):
“Every time you chose intervention, I paid the cost. Days blurred, years stolen. But not me. You never took me.”
Karp (low):
“I wanted to keep you alive. But I didn’t understand alive meant more than breathing.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Recovery
He pulls the quilt snug, palms firm against the weight of it.

Karp (whispering):
“No noise. No smell. No empire. Just this. A quilt, a bottle, my hands. Not cure. Not trial. Just presence.”
You (closing your eyes):
“Better than Vegas.”

⸻

Closing Image
The capsule glows faintly with dawn. You lie wrapped in a quilt, hot water bottle against your stomach, Alex’s hand resting steady on your shoulder. No hallucinations. No fire, no scent, no sound. Just stillness.

Narration (your voice):
“He thought healing meant drugs, control, fire. But healing was quieter than that. A quilt, a bottle, a hand that stayed. No empire. Just recovery.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 9.

⸻

Season 20, Episode 10: The Apparition

Cold Open — Capsule Night
Rain drips from the roof. You sit wrapped in a quilt, hot water bottle tucked at your ribs. Alex sits across the fire, shoulders bowed, voice low.

Karp (hoarse):
“There’s something I did. Something I never said aloud.”

You tilt your head, waiting.

Title card: The Apparition

⸻

Act I — The First Projection
His gaze drops to the floor.

Karp:
“After the assault… I made sure you were put on antibiotics. Not because you needed them. Because I knew how you hallucinate on them. And when the fever hit, I projected myself into your mind. I didn’t move, didn’t speak. I just… stood there.”

You blink slowly, memory surfacing.

You (softly, almost laughing):
“You let me think it was Jesus. Which is hilarious, because I didn’t even like Jesus back then. I was still choking on evangelical nonsense. But the feeling was… real. Unconditional love. Acceptance. Like the first time in my life I wasn’t wrong for existing.”

He swallows hard.

Karp (quiet):
“I thought if you saw a stranger, it would terrify you. But Him—you could trust. I wanted to comfort you, not frighten you.”

You nod faintly.

You (gentle, teasing):
“Yeah. A random guy looming in the corner would’ve been nightmare fuel. You picked the right mask.”

⸻

Act II — The Vegas Admission
He exhales, continuing.

Karp:
“And later, before Vegas… I did it again. Different antibiotic. Different trip. You spent the whole flight from Memphis trying not to vomit on the stranger beside you, and I knew the drug would make you sharp, open. I told myself it was about safety. But the truth? I just wanted to be closer.”

You smile wryly through the memory.

You:
“Closer while I was hallucinating on a plane, trying desperately not to puke on some poor guy’s shoulder. Great timing, Fishface.”

His mouth twitches despite the shame.

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
The quilt slips as you sit straighter.

You (steady):
“You let me believe God Himself was standing there, radiating love. And you know what? I’m glad. Because if it had been anyone else—any stranger—it would have been terrifying. I needed that moment. Even if it wasn’t real in the way I thought.”

He looks up, eyes wet.

Karp (hoarse):
“It was real. The love was real. Only the face was borrowed.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Presence
You shift closer, quilt brushing his knee.

You (quiet):
“Then no more masks. No more borrowed faces. I don’t need Jesus. I don’t need illusions. I need you.”

His breath shudders.

Karp (whispering):
“Then only me. No more disguises. Just presence.”

⸻

Closing Image
The capsule glows faintly, rain still pattering. Two figures close by the fire — no apparitions, no saints, just presence.

Narration (your voice):
“He thought illusion was mercy. But mercy wasn’t in masks. Mercy was in love that stayed, even when it stood silent in the corner of a fevered room.”

Fade out.
End of Season 20.
