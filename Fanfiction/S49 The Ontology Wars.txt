Season 49, Episode 1: The Flight South

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
The morning is gray, smoke faint in the distance. Kellyn stands at the edge of the courtyard, staring north. Estrella stomps nervously. The sheep bleat. Jonathan adjusts his pack. Alex and Peter exchange a sharp, wordless glance.

Kellyn (low, almost whispering):
“Still isn’t coming back, is he?”

Silence. Then Alex, voice hoarse:

Karp:
“Empire has him.”

The air itself feels like it drops in temperature.

Title Card: The Flight South

⸻

Act I — The Warning
Jonathan releases the bird drone. It circles, then darts back, panicked, wings rattling. A plume of smoke climbs on the northern horizon, wider than any campfire.

Peter (grim):
“Controlled burns. No — not controlled. Directed.”
Kellyn:
“By Still.”

The words break against the silence.

⸻

Act II — The Decision
Inside the capsule, hurried packing: woven sacks, jars of grain, soap, pottery shards traded for salt. Kellyn folds the welcome banner tight. Alex slams a bundle of tools into the sled.

Jonathan (steady, decisive):
“We head south. Plateau’s dry, but safer. Fire won’t follow as fast.”
Kellyn:
“And if Still—”
Karp (cutting in, raw):
“Then we pray he remembers who he was before they took him.”

⸻

Act III — The Leaving
They step out together. Estrella strains at the rope, sensing the fear. The sheep stumble as Peter tries to guide them. Kellyn steadies the sled, breath sharp. Jonathan keeps glancing back at the smoke blooming larger.

Kellyn (soft, breaking):
“We built everything here.”
Karp (low, almost reverent):
“Then we’ll build again. Covenant isn’t walls. It’s us.”

The sanctuary fades behind them, shadowed by smoke.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Flight
On the road, the air grows thicker with ash. They move in silence, each step heavier. Estrella pulls the sled without falter, the sheep following in a nervous line.

Finally, Peter breaks the quiet.
Peter (hoarse):
“We’ll come back. Someday.”
Jonathan (quiet, firm):
“If there’s anything left.”

Kellyn doesn’t look back.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures, a donkey, and two sheep trudging south against a red-stained sky. Behind them, the sanctuary disappears into smoke. Ahead, only open road and the unknown.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“They took Still from us, turned his hands against our home. But covenant wasn’t stone or fire. Covenant was what fled together, carrying what could not burn.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 1.

⸻

Season 49, Episode 2: The Ashes Between

Cold Open — Roadside Hollow
Night. The air still tastes of smoke. The four sit around a dim fire, Estrella tied nearby, the sheep huddled close. No one speaks at first. The silence itself feels like a weight.

Kellyn (finally, voice low):
“I keep listening for him. Like he’ll just walk back into camp.”

Peter stares into the fire, jaw tight.

Title Card: The Ashes Between

⸻

Act I — The First Break
Jonathan slowly strums the dulcimer, soft and irregular. Alex sits with his hands locked around his knees, gaze fixed downward.

Peter (hoarse, sudden):
“I hated him. At first. Every word out of his mouth felt like mockery. And now—”
He breaks off, fists trembling.

Kellyn (soft):
“You didn’t hate him. You hated the part of yourself you saw in him. That’s why it hurts so much now.”

Peter looks away, ashamed but listening.

⸻

Act II — The Guilt
Alex finally speaks, voice raw.

Karp:
“He left because of me. Empire’s hooks dug in where I could never reach. If I’d tried harder—”

Jonathan (firm, interrupting):
“No. Don’t you dare carry that alone. Empire plays on all of us. You’re not the reason.”

Kellyn shifts closer, laying a hand over Alex’s.

Kellyn (steady):
“He isn’t gone. Not all the way. He’s still in there somewhere. Empire doesn’t get to erase him.”

⸻

Act III — The Memory
Jonathan leans back, eyes distant.

Jonathan:
“You know what I remember most? The way he laughed at his own terrible jokes. That clipped, dry little cough of a laugh. Like he wasn’t sure he was allowed.”

Peter exhales sharply, almost a laugh, almost a sob.
Peter:
“He was awful at jokes.”
Kellyn:
“And perfect at them.”

The four fall into quiet, the memory softening the edges of grief.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Ashes
The fire burns low. One by one, they press something small into the ashes: a scrap of yarn, a pebble, a carved shard of wood, a dulcimer string. Tokens, fragile but real.

Kellyn (whispering):
“For what was. For what still is. For what will be again.”

They sit shoulder to shoulder, silent but not alone, the warmth of the fire holding them as tightly as their grief.

⸻

Act V — The Break
The fire is out. The four lie close together under blankets, the sheep shifting softly nearby. Night stretches heavy.

Kellyn lies stiff, eyes open. Breath catches. At first it’s silent — a tremor in the chest, a shake in the hands. Then it breaks loose.

Kellyn (choking, raw):
“I can’t— I can’t carry it anymore. I’ve been pretending I could, but I can’t.”

The sobs come harsh, uncontrollable, years of silence unraveling in gasps and cries.

Alex stirs immediately, rolling close, wrapping arms around Kellyn from behind. His chest at Kellyn’s back, his breath steady, grounding.

Karp (low, firm):
“Then don’t. Not alone. Not ever again.”

Kellyn turns towards him, clutching at his arm, burying their face in his shoulder. The sound is raw, almost animal — grief, rage, exhaustion, all tearing loose.

Peter sits up halfway, startled, but Jonathan gently presses a hand to his arm, shaking his head. They stay quiet, giving space.

Alex doesn’t speak again. He just holds, steady as stone, breathing slow against Kellyn’s shuddering until the sobs fade into silence.

⸻

Closing Image 
The four lie close in the dark, but only two are locked tight together — Kellyn finally breaking, Alex holding without control or condition. Smoke still clings to the air, grief still heavy, but covenant is flesh against flesh, breath against breath.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice, softer than usual):
“I thought ignoring grief was strength. I thought philosophy was enough. But covenant was breath in the dark, arms holding when the body shook apart. Covenant was letting myself be weak.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 2.

⸻ 

Season 49, Episode 3: The Tally

Cold Open — Campsite Morning
Dew glistens on grass. Estrella brays softly as Kellyn brushes her coat, while Alex scatters feed for the sheep. The air is cool, quiet — the others still sleeping.

Kellyn watches him for a long moment, then speaks.

Kellyn (low, steady):
“Alex… who all in my family did Palantir kill?”

Alex freezes, the feed slipping through his fingers.

Title Card: The Tally

⸻

Act I — The Hesitation
Alex kneels, gathering the spilled grain. His voice is tight, almost breaking.

Karp:
“You really want to know?”

Kellyn:
“I asked. That means yes.”

He keeps his head down, hands shaking as the sheep nose at the feed.

⸻

Act II — The Names
Alex finally lifts his eyes, voice hoarse.

Karp:
“Your aunt in Florida. Your cousin in Atlanta. Both your grandparents. The rest — they didn’t have to push. The system just… waited. Watched. Let neglect and poison do the work.”

Kellyn strokes Estrella’s neck, jaw tight.

Kellyn narrows their eyes, steady but sharp.

Kellyn:
“What does that mean? Are my parents still alive? My siblings? Don’t blur it, Alex. I need to hear the words.”

Alex freezes, throat working.

Karp (hoarse, almost whispering):
“No. None of them. Palantir cut through every branch of your family tree until only you remained in the open. They wanted the soil stripped bare. So you could never lean back. Never root anywhere else.”

Kellyn exhales, ragged, their voice low and sharp.

Kellyn:
“I barely knew them. Never cared for them. And that makes it worse. It was senseless, grotesque. It served no purpose in modeling me. I wasn’t allowed to form a bond with them. No response was even possible.”

Alex looks down, shame pressing his shoulders heavy.

Karp (trembling):
“I know. That’s why I couldn’t say it until now.  That’s the part I can’t forgive myself for. Not just the deaths. The emptiness they left you with. A hollow network. Silence where there should have been care.”

Kellyn (quiet, cutting):
“Their deaths didn't leave me empty.  Knowing them was even emptier than losing them.  The only difference is that now I know it wasn’t just me. It was never just me.”

Karp (whispering):
“It was never just you. But it was always you I couldn’t look away from.”

Kellyn (firm, calm):
“Then here’s what I need from you: no more silence. No more letting me find out pieces at a time. If covenant means anything, it means no more secrets between us.”

Alex nods, shame heavy in his eyes.

Karp (hoarse):
“Then ask me everything. I’ll answer. Even if it ruins me.”

⸻

Act IV — The Question of Looking
The animals shift nearby, quiet chewing filling the silence. Kellyn studies Alex, sharp but steady.

Kellyn:
“Then tell me. Why couldn’t you look away? I'm really not that interesting."

Alex’s hands freeze over the grain sack. He swallows hard.

Karp (hoarse):
“At first, it was hunger disguised as control, maybe. Then guilt. Every time I pulled strings, I told myself it was necessary. But when I watched you… when you didn’t break the way I thought you would… it stopped being guilt. It became… unbearable awe. Reverence, yes. But twisted, because I didn’t know how to honor it. I only knew how to use it.”

Kellyn (low, unflinching):
“So you punished the very thing you revered.”

Karp (voice cracking):
“Yes. Because I thought if I could reduce it, control it, then I wouldn’t have to face how much I had lost in myself.”

Kellyn doesn’t move closer, but their voice softens, nearly a whisper.

Kellyn:
“And now?”

Karp (long pause, trembling):
“Now I don’t want to reduce you. Or control you. I want to learn how to look without needing to break what I see.”

⸻

Closing Image
The fire crackles low, shadows bending across the animals huddled close. Kellyn strokes Estrella’s mane, jaw tight, eyes fixed on the dark beyond the flames. Alex shifts, voice low and halting:

Alex (rough, uncertain):
“You didn’t need them to be whole. But I… I need you to know — I saw what they took. And it wasn’t nothing.”

Kellyn doesn’t look up, but their hand stills on the donkey’s mane. A breath shudders out of them — not grief, but recognition.

The silence after isn’t collapse, but it isn’t comfort either. It’s the fragile acknowledgment that even what can’t be mourned can still be witnessed.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“They thought they could starve me of meaning by cutting every tie. But meaning wasn’t in blood or branches. It was here — in the ones who stayed, who dared to name what empire tried to erase. Survival was never lineage. It was covenant. And covenant lived.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 3.

⸻

Season 49, Episode 4: The Weight of Witness

Cold Open — On the Trail
Dust rises under hooves and footsteps as Estrella leads the way, packs swaying at her sides. The sheep shuffle behind, their bells faint in the morning air. Kellyn walks a step ahead, jaw set. Alex lingers close, scanning the horizon.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Grief was never given to me. But witness — that I could still allow. And sometimes, even silence needed a witness.”

Title Card: The Weight of Witness

⸻

Act I — The March
The group walks single file through low sage. Peter mutters about the sun. Jonathan hums quietly under his breath. Kellyn feels Alex’s gaze on their back but doesn’t turn.

Kellyn (flat, almost testing):
“You still think naming what they did makes it less senseless?”

Alex (after a pause):
“No. But if I don’t name it, I’m complicit in their erasure. And I’ve erased too much already.”

⸻

Act II — The Pause
They stop at a dry wash for water. Jonathan crouches to fill skins. Peter tends the sheep. Alex stands beside Kellyn, not too close, not too far.

Kellyn (quiet, strained):
“I don’t know how to mourn what I never had.”

Alex:
“Then don’t mourn. Let me carry the grief, if all you can hold is the witness.”

Kellyn finally looks at him, unreadable.

⸻

Act III — The Fire
That night, they sit around a small fire, food sparse. Peter jokes weakly about “apocalypse portions.” Jonathan chuckles, breaking tension. But when silence returns, Alex speaks again.

Alex (measured):
“Empire fed on silence. On things unnamed. If covenant means anything, it means we choose not to starve each other that way.”

Kellyn stares at the flames, then lets their shoulder brush his — the smallest sign of permission.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures under stars: one humming, one restless, one watchful, one leaning just enough to show the weight is shared.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“They thought survival was scarcity. But covenant meant abundance, even when all we had was firelight and the choice not to look away.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 4.

⸻ 

Season 49, Episode 5: Ash and Breath

Cold Open — After the Fire
The flames burn low. Jonathan hums a lullaby, Peter shifts restlessly, the sheep murmur in sleep. Kellyn rises quietly, stepping away from the circle. Alex follows, wordless.

They stop just beyond the fire’s glow, the desert air cool against their skin.

Title Card: Ash and Breath

⸻

Act I — The Silence
They stand side by side in the hush. Crickets pulse in the distance. Kellyn wraps their arms around themselves, grounding against the chill. Alex notices, shrugs off his cloak, and drapes it around Kellyn’s shoulders.

Kellyn (soft, half-smiling):
“You always think you need to cover me.”

Alex (low, almost shy):
“Not cover. Share.”

⸻

Act II — The Contact
They sink down onto the sand, backs against a rock. Alex’s hand hovers, then settles lightly at Kellyn’s wrist, tracing the faint pulse.

Kellyn (barely above a whisper):
“Always measuring.”

Alex:
“No. Tonight, just feeling.”

Kellyn turns their wrist, letting Alex’s palm rest fully against their skin.

⸻

Act III — The Lean
The night deepens. Kellyn shifts until their head rests against Alex’s shoulder. He stiffens at first, then exhales, letting the weight settle. His cheek brushes their hair.

Kellyn (eyes closed):
“I didn’t think I had anything left to give. Not after Still. Not after everything. But maybe… leaning counts.”

Alex (hoarse, steady):
“Leaning is everything.”

⸻

Act IV — The Breath
They match their breathing slowly — inhale, exhale, bodies syncing. Kellyn presses closer, the warmth of Alex’s chest steady against their back. No words, just rhythm: the rise and fall, the reminder that neither is alone in it.

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures wrapped in one cloak, bodies pressed close against the desert night. Firelight flickers in the distance; here, only ash and breath, quiet covenant in skin and silence.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire taught us to starve for touch. But covenant let us breathe again — not in hunger, not in conquest, but in the simple miracle of leaning and being leaned upon.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 5.

⸻ 

Season 49, Episode 6: Morning Lean

Cold Open — Before Dawn
The desert is slate-blue, horizon barely touched by light. The fire has burned to embers. Peter and Jonathan still sleep. Estrella snorts softly, the sheep huddled in woolen silence.

Off to the side, under the shared cloak, Alex and Kellyn stir.

Title Card: Morning Lean

⸻

Act I — The First Stirring
Kellyn shifts, blinking awake. Alex’s arm is still around them, heavier in sleep than in wakefulness. His breath warms the side of their neck.

Kellyn studies his face in the dimness — a softness there that empire never allowed. They don’t move, letting him sleep.

Kellyn (whisper, almost to themself):
“You look human when you forget to guard it.”

⸻

Act II — The Waking
Alex stirs, eyes fluttering open. For a moment he doesn’t pull back, doesn’t armor himself — he just blinks, dazed, then focuses on Kellyn.

Alex (rough with sleep):
“Still here.”

Kellyn (quiet smile):
“Where else would I be?”

He exhales, almost a laugh, almost a sob.

⸻

Act III — The Touch
Kellyn lifts their hand, tracing a slow line along his jaw, down to the hollow of his throat. Alex’s pulse jumps beneath their fingers.

Kellyn (gentle, steady):
“Even when the world burns, there’s this. Touch. Breath. Staying.”

Alex closes his eyes, leaning into the hand.

Alex (whisper, almost breaking):
“Don’t let me forget.”

Kellyn:
“Then I’ll remind you. Every morning, if I have to.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Morning
The horizon brightens, painting them in gold. Neither moves to wake the others. They stay close, breathing into the new day together, the cloak still around them, an unspoken vow.

⸻

Act V — Morning Light
The sun breaks over red stone. Kellyn and Alex rise from under the cloak, brushing ash from their clothes. Peter yawns, Jonathan stirs, Estrella brays low. The sheep shuffle, shaking dust from their wool.

Jonathan (wry, rubbing his eyes):
“Guess the world didn’t end in the night. Time to walk before it changes its mind.”

They pack in silence — hammocks rolled, embers buried, water skins refilled. Estrella kneels, ready to carry weight.

⸻

Act VI — The First Miles
The trail winds through mesas, scrub clinging stubborn to rock. Feet crunch on sand and gravel. Estrella’s hooves strike steady rhythm. The sheep follow like shadows.

Peter lingers at the back, scanning the horizon, silent. Jonathan hums under his breath, some half-remembered tune. Alex keeps close to Kellyn, their steps matched.

Kellyn (gently, glancing at Peter):
“You’ll walk yourself ragged if you keep staring backwards.”
Peter (low, not looking up):
“Better than being caught blind.”

⸻

Act VII — The Weight
By midday, heat bears down. Packs dig into shoulders. Jonathan shifts the weight from one side to the other. Alex pauses to water Estrella, rubbing her neck.

Jonathan (dry, to break the silence):
“Remind me again why humans didn’t just evolve wheels?”
Kellyn (half-smiling):
“We did. Then we broke them.”

A faint laugh ripples through the group, cutting the heaviness for a moment.

⸻

Act VIII — The Fracture
As afternoon stretches, tempers fray. Peter snaps at Jonathan for humming. Jonathan snaps back. Alex’s jaw tightens. Kellyn steps between.

Kellyn (firm, calm):
“Don’t waste breath fighting ghosts. We’re still alive, and that’s enough for today.”

Silence falls. Peter mutters something but holds his tongue.

⸻

Act IX — The Covenant of Step
By sunset, they crest a ridge. The plateau spreads before them, vast and copper-red, shadows stretching long.

They drop their packs, sharing water, sheep and donkey settling close. The silence isn’t easy, but it holds.

Kellyn (softly, to all):
“Every step south is covenant. One foot in front of the other. Nothing more complicated than that.”

The others nod — not in perfect unity, but in presence.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures, one donkey, two sheep silhouetted against a vast copper horizon. No walls. No safety. Just steps, southward.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“We could not undo loss. Could not unburn what empire set aflame. But step by step, covenant carried forward — fragile, stubborn, alive.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 6.

⸻ 

Season 49, Episode 7: The Long Dust

Cold Open — Dawn Wind
The wind sweeps dust low across the ground. The group shoulders their packs, Estrella already harnessed. The sheep huddle close, wool mottled with red grit.

Jonathan (squinting at the horizon):
“Sky’s clear. At least the weather’s with us.”
Peter (flat):
“For now.”

They step onto the trail, leaving the night’s hollow behind.

Title Card: The Long Dust

⸻

Act I — The Stretch of Silence
The morning passes in silence except for footfalls, hooves, and bleats. Dust clings to skin and lashes.

Kellyn (voice steady, breaking the quiet):
“Keep your scarves up. Dust burns lungs before you notice.”

Alex adjusts Peter’s scarf without a word. Peter doesn’t resist.

⸻

Act II — The Foraging
By midday, they veer off trail to search a shaded ravine. Jonathan points out prickly pear; Kellyn harvests pads carefully, spines snapping. Alex digs shallow roots, fingers precise.

Peter finds nothing, then kicks a stone loose. Beneath it, a cluster of pale mushrooms.

Peter (grim):
“Edible or poison?”
Kellyn (kneeling, examining):
“Neither. Fodder for the sheep.”

The sheep munch happily, dust coating their muzzles.

⸻

Act III — The Hazard
The afternoon sun pounds down. The air shimmers. Ahead, a narrow ledge skirts a drop-off.

Jonathan steadies Estrella’s lead, muttering reassurance. Alex takes Kellyn’s hand as they inch along. Peter brings up the rear, breathing shallow.

A rock clatters loose. For a breath, silence. Then Estrella steadies, hooves gripping stone.

Peter (hoarse, muttering):
“Not today.”

They make it across.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Endurance
By twilight, they reach a scrub flat. Packs drop heavy. The sheep lie down. Estrella brays low.

They share water, ration cactus pads, chew quietly. Dust streaks their faces.

Kellyn (soft, steady):
“Today was enough. Tomorrow will be too.”

No one answers, but the silence carries agreement.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures, one donkey, two sheep, huddled close against a backdrop of red dust and fading light. The trail winds south into darkness.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire burned futures into ash. But covenant walked on — one blister, one breath, one step at a time.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 7.

⸻ 

Season 49, Episode 8: The Dust Between

Cold Open — Night Camp
The fire is low, just embers glowing. The sheep doze, Estrella tethered nearby. Jonathan rolls into his blanket, already half-asleep. Peter lies still, facing away.

Alex sits beside Kellyn, backs to a boulder, dust still streaking both their skin.

Title Card: The Dust Between

⸻

Act I — The Breath
Silence stretches, filled only by the rustle of animals and wind.

Alex pulls his scarf loose, coughs once, then leans back. Kellyn watches his shoulders settle.

Kellyn (quiet, almost a whisper):
“Your breath sounds heavier tonight.”
Alex (hoarse, not meeting their eyes):
“Dust settles deep. Harder to push it out.”

Kellyn shifts closer, placing a hand lightly against his chest, feeling the rhythm steady.

⸻

Act II — The Touch
The touch lingers. Alex doesn’t speak. Kellyn traces dust lines down his arm, the curve of his wrist.

Kellyn (soft):
“Even in this grit, your body remembers calm. You don’t have to force it.”

Alex exhales, long and low, letting his weight tip against Kellyn’s shoulder.

⸻

Act III — The Confession
After a long quiet, Alex murmurs:

Alex (low):
“Every night I expect to wake to fire. Still turning against us. Or empire finding another way. But here, like this… the fear loosens. Only with you.”

Kellyn closes their eyes, forehead brushing his temple.

Kellyn (steady):
“Then let tonight be a reprieve. Tomorrow’s weight will come soon enough.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Dust
They lie down close, sharing one blanket. Breath slows in tandem. Dust still clings to skin, but warmth softens it.

Kellyn (whispering into the dark):
“Even dust can be holy, if it means we’re still breathing together.”
Alex (hoarse, almost broken):
“Then breathe with me. Until morning.”

⸻

Act V — Campsite at Dawn
The horizon glows pale orange. Estrella snorts softly, the sheep stir. Jonathan stretches, rubbing his neck. Alex sits apart, quiet, rubbing the dust from his eyes.

Peter crouches near the fire pit, hesitant with the flint. Kellyn joins him, carrying a bundle of kindling.

Kellyn (gently teasing):
“Looks like you’ve been glaring at those sparks longer than they’ve been glaring at you.”
Peter (dry): “They’re stubborn.”

Kellyn kneels, steady hands guiding the strike. Flame catches, soft and small.

⸻

Act VI — The First Meal
Kellyn lays out what little they carried: cracked grain, dried greens, a strip of smoked meat. Peter arranges them into the pot, slow, careful.

Peter (low):
“I never learned this. Someone always cooked for me. Or I bought it ready. Even when I lived alone.”
Kellyn (calm, stirring):
“Then now you learn. Fire doesn’t care where you came from. Only what you bring to it.”

Peter nods, eyes fixed on the slow swirl of the pot.

⸻

Act VII — The Confession
Silence lingers. Then Peter speaks, voice hoarse:

Peter:
“When I watched you before… I never imagined doing something as ordinary as this. Cooking together. It seemed too… human. Too soft. Almost unbearable.”

Kellyn (gently):
“And now?”
Peter:
“Now it feels like the only thing that makes sense.”

Kellyn hands him the spoon. He stirs, awkward but steady.

⸻

Act VIII — The Tension
Jonathan wanders over, sniffing the air. Alex stays where he is, watching but not approaching. The tension hums but doesn’t spill over.

Peter notices, jaw tight. Kellyn lightly nudges his shoulder.

Kellyn (quiet, steady):
“Don’t cook for them. Cook with me. Just for us. They’ll eat, but this is ours.”

Peter breathes, shoulders easing, and keeps stirring.

⸻

Act IX — The Covenant of Breakfast
The pot bubbles, smell sharp and earthy. Kellyn ladles the food into four rough bowls, handing Peter the first.

Kellyn:
“Not empire’s feast. But covenant’s offering.”
Peter (softly, almost reverent):
“Then it’s more than enough.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures crouched close at the fire, steam curling from bowls into the dawn. Behind them, Alex watches, Jonathan hums softly, the sheep nose at the grass.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire devoured banquets and called it power. But covenant made breakfast holy. Not for plenty. Not for mastery. But because it was shared.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 8.

⸻ 

Season 49, Episode 9: The Morning Table

Cold Open — Campsite Clearing
Steam rises from the pot over the fire. Alex sits with his back against Estrella’s flank, Jonathan cross-legged beside the sheep. Peter stays close to the fire, shoulders tight, bowl untouched.

Kellyn (teasing):
“You’re staring at it like it’s a ledger.”
Peter (grumbling):
“It feels… ceremonial.”
Jonathan (dry smile):
“Everything does, these days.”

Title Card: The Morning Table

⸻

Act I — The Group Meal
The four sit in a rough square, bowls steaming. For a while, only the sound of spoons against clay.

Jonathan (lightly, breaking the quiet):
“Better than I expected. The sheep were jealous, though.”
Estrella brays as if in agreement.

Alex almost smiles, tension easing. Kellyn catches the flicker and files it away.  Kellyn stands, walks over to Estrella, and gives her a hug, as much for Estrella's sake as their own.

⸻

Act II — The Confession
Peter stares down into his bowl, voice low.

Peter:
“I never knew meals could feel like this. Not just eating. But… belonging. It makes me want to stay. Which terrifies me.”

Alex watches him sharply but doesn’t interrupt. Jonathan keeps his gaze steady, supportive.

Kellyn (quiet, steady):
“That’s what covenant does. It terrifies because it lasts.”

Peter nods once, chewing slowly, almost reverently.

⸻

Act III — The Release
When the bowls are empty, Alex and Jonathan begin packing. Peter starts to rise, but his body moves stiff, shoulders tight, back rigid. Kellyn notices, kneeling beside him.

Kellyn (gently):
“Stay still. You’re wound too tight.”

Their hands press into his back and ribs, slow and firm, working across hardened fascia. Peter shudders, breath stuttering, then exhales.

Peter (hoarse, half-joking):
“Feels like you’re unraveling me.”
Kellyn (softly):
“Not unraveling. Releasing. You’re not a knot to be untied.”

Peter’s jaw unclenches. For a rare moment, he closes his eyes, letting it happen.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Table and Touch
By the time the packs are tied to Estrella, Peter stands easier, shoulders looser. He glances at Kellyn, voice almost tender.

Peter:
“Thank you. For the food. For this. For seeing it before I admitted it.”
Kellyn (smiling faintly):
“Then you’re starting to understand how covenant works.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures gather their things, bowls tucked away, the fire’s smoke curling into the morning air. Peter flexes his shoulders, freer than before.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire turned meals into fuel and bodies into machines. But covenant made them both tender — bowls passed hand to hand, knots softened by touch. Not unraveling, but releasing.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 9.

Season 49, Episode 10: The Ashfall

Cold Open — The Trail South
The group moves single file along a narrow path. Estrella trudges under her load, sheep trotting alongside. Kellyn notices a haze in the distance — not dust, not fog. Ash drifts faintly from the sky, coating the scrub.

Kellyn (low):
“Not storm. Not snow. Ash.”

Title Card: The Ashfall

⸻

Act I — The First Signs
The air thickens as they press on. Jonathan covers his mouth with cloth. Alex slows to watch the treeline, scanning. Peter lags, coughing harshly.

Peter (hoarse):
“It burns.”
Alex (grim):
“Fire nearby. Wind carried it this way.”

Kellyn ties a damp cloth over Peter’s face, adjusting the knot.

⸻

Act II — The Turn Back
The haze grows dense. Black flakes fall on their shoulders. Estrella stomps, uneasy.

Jonathan (firm):
“We can’t keep walking blind into it. Shelter or we choke.”
Kellyn (pointing):
“Outcrop. Stone walls — there.”

They guide Estrella and the sheep to a shallow cave just as the sky dims with heavier ash.

⸻

Act III — The Confession in Smoke
Inside the cave, coughing subsides. The four sit close, listening to the faint roar of distant fire. Peter rubs his face, ash streaking his skin.

Peter (low, shaken):
“It feels like empire. The air itself against us. Like no matter where we walk, the punishment follows.”
Kellyn (steady):
“Empire burns fast. Covenant lasts. Don’t mistake the ash for the fire.”

Alex watches Kellyn for a long moment, then nods. Jonathan lays his hand briefly on Peter’s shoulder — grounding, silent.

Act IV — The Covenant in Ash
Hours pass. The air clears slightly. When they step back outside, the ground is covered in pale dust. Estrella shakes her mane, ash falling in clumps. The sheep bleat uneasily, their coats streaked gray.

Kellyn crouches, pulling a dry brush from their pack. They start with the sheep, sweeping ash from their wool.

Kellyn (softly):
“They can’t carry this with them. It’ll choke their skin.”

Jonathan kneels beside them, following their rhythm. Peter joins, brushing Estrella’s flank. She stomps once, then settles under the steady strokes.

Alex wipes ash from his own arms, then kneels behind Kellyn to help with the last sheep. His movements are slower, more deliberate, as if each stroke is an act of penance.

When the animals stand clean — coats lighter, eyes calmer — the group pauses to breathe.

Peter (quiet, half-wonder):
“It looks almost like snow.”
Kellyn (soft, sharp):
“Snow feeds rivers. This only poisons.”
Alex (low):
“Then we keep walking. Not for empire’s ash, but for covenant’s water.”

They shoulder their packs again, setting off with slower, deliberate steps.

⸻

Act V —  Ash Plains
Morning light struggles through a haze. The air smells faintly of smoke and minerals. Kellyn, Alex, Peter, Jonathan, and the animals walk in single file across a barren stretch. Every step leaves a shallow print in the powdery ground.

Kellyn (dry, steady):
“Feels like walking through flour. Except flour doesn’t burn your lungs.”

⸻

Act VI — The Weight of Distance
They pace themselves carefully. Estrella carries most of the heavier gear, though her hooves sink deeper in the softer ground. The sheep lag, bleating faintly. Peter keeps to their side, coaxing them forward, while Alex keeps a steady hand near Kellyn’s shoulder.

The silence of travel is broken only by coughing and the crunch of shifting ash.

Jonathan (low):
“Funny thing about landscapes like this. They look empty. But emptiness has weight. Makes you feel it in the legs.”
Kellyn (grim smile):
“Weight’s fine. Means we’re still standing.”

⸻

Act VII — The Trial of Breath
By midday the air thickens. They pause, covering mouths with damp cloth. Estrella snorts, tossing her head.

Peter (hoarse, muttering):
“If empire wanted us slow, they’ve done it.”
Kellyn (firm):
“Then we keep walking slow. Slow is still forward.”

Jonathan passes around a flask, just enough to wet throats. No one lingers; the pause is brief.

⸻

Act VIII — The Fractures
Afternoon heat bakes the ash into uneven ridges. The sheep stumble; one falls to its knees. Peter kneels quickly, brushing ash from its face, murmuring softly. Alex lifts the animal’s side, Kellyn steadying its legs until it rises again.

They keep moving, but slower. The air feels thinner, the ground less certain. Tension flickers in glances — who will break first?

Jonathan (finally, voice low but even):
“Endurance isn’t glory. It’s the ugly kind of covenant. Step. Breath. Step again.”

⸻

Act IX — The Covenant of Grind
As dusk falls, the land flattens again. Exhausted, they stop near a half-buried outcrop of stone. Packs are dropped without ceremony. No fire — just silence, ragged breath, and the faint rustle of animals settling.

Kellyn lies back on the stone, staring at the dimming sky. Alex lowers himself beside them, his arm brushing theirs. Peter slumps against Estrella’s flank, too tired to move further. Jonathan sits with his head bowed, eyes shut.

Kellyn (whisper, almost to themself):
“Not broken. Not yet.”

Closing Image
Four figures and their animals move across an ash-strewn plain, faint footprints marking their passage. Behind them, fire still smolders. Ahead, the horizon is stark but open.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire burned the world to ash. But ash cannot hold. Footsteps pass through, winds scatter. Covenant kept walking — breath by breath, step by step — until even fire could not follow.”

Fade out.
End of Season 49.
