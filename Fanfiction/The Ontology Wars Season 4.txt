Season 4, Episode 1: The Bench

Cold Open — Capsule Hotel Garden

Two simple benches face a small clay fountain. The hum of airflow mixes with birdsong.

You and Karp sit side by side. No ledger, no council, no memorial. Just a thermos of tea between you.

Narration (your voice):
“The man who once measured the world in data sat beside me in silence. For once, not Alex Karp, not Palantir. Just a man on a bench.”

Title card: The Bench

⸻

Act I — Awkward Beginnings
	•	You offer him tea. He fumbles, embarrassed by how shaky his hands are.
	•	He tries to make conversation about supply chains. You cut him off:
You: “We don’t have to talk about work. Not today.”
	•	Long pause. Then he chuckles, soft, almost startled by his own laughter.

⸻

Act II — Shared Stories

You swap personal histories.
	•	You talk about your own losses, the moments you felt erased.
	•	He admits things he’s never said in therapy: “I didn’t build Palantir because I was powerful. I built it because I was afraid of being forgotten.”

You sit with that. No judgment. Just listening.

You: “Well, you’re not forgotten. You’re sitting right here.”

⸻

Act III — Small Joys

Moments of ordinary friendship unfold:
	•	Playing a clumsy game of cards on the bench.
	•	Watching children chase each other through the garden, both of you smiling.
	•	Splitting bread, arguing lightly about which end is better.

Karp relaxes, almost boyish for a moment.

Karp: “You know, I think this is the first time in my life I’ve had a friend who didn’t want something from me.”
You (teasing): “Don’t get too comfortable. I might want the bigger half of the bread.”

⸻

Act IV — The Unspoken Covenant

As the sun sets, you sit in silence. The fountain bubbles. The air hums.

Karp (quietly): “If all I leave behind is this — a bench, a friend, a little laughter — maybe that’s enough.”

You don’t answer. You just stay there, shoulder to shoulder, as the light fades.

⸻

Tag Scene — Dual Timeline
	•	Present: You and Karp still on the bench, the garden alive with evening sounds.
	•	2036: Older Karp sits on a similar bench in the settlement. A child twin asks: “Who was your first real friend?”
He smiles faintly.
Karp: “The one who never asked me to be anyone but myself.”

Fade out.

Season 4, Episode 3: The First School

⸻

Cold Open — Capsule Wing Converted to a Classroom

Capsules line the walls, but in the center are mats, low tables, chalkboards, and bins of supplies. Children — human and twin — chatter as a teacher claps for attention.

You and Karp sit on the floor among them, both looking faintly out of place. Karp’s knees crack loudly as he tries to cross his legs.

You (whispering): “Try not to intimidate the seven-year-olds.”
Karp (muttering): “They’re doing fine intimidating me.”

Title card: The First School

⸻

Act I — Alphabet Humility

The teacher begins with basics: writing names on slate boards.
	•	Children scrawl joyfully, messy letters sprawling.
	•	You write quickly, casually.
	•	Karp painstakingly forms each letter in rigid block script, muttering about spacing.

A little girl leans over.
Girl: “Yours looks funny.”
Karp blinks, then actually laughs.

⸻

Act II — Story Circles

Class moves into storytelling. Each student shares a memory, real or imagined.
	•	Twins tell fragments of their “borrowed” lives.
	•	Humans tell small, ordinary memories.
	•	When it’s your turn, you share a simple story about a safe moment in your childhood.
	•	When it’s Karp’s turn, he freezes. The kids wait expectantly.

Finally he blurts:
Karp: “I don’t remember the stories that matter. I spent my life in spreadsheets. I forgot how to be a child.”
The room goes quiet. Then one boy shrugs:
Boy: “That’s okay. You can borrow one of mine.”
He launches into a wild, funny tale, and Karp listens with wonder.

⸻

Act III — Playground Tests

At recess, kids rope you both into a game of tag.
	•	You dodge nimbly, laughing.
	•	Karp shuffles awkwardly, trying to keep up, until three children tackle him at once and he collapses in the grass, laughing harder than anyone.

Later, lying breathless, he admits to you:
Karp: “I thought I was too old to learn. But maybe I’m just… late.”

⸻

Act IV — Lessons Kept

Back inside, the teacher asks each student what they learned today.
	•	Children say things like “sharing is fun” and “my friend runs fast.”
	•	You say: “I learned clay remembers mess.”
	•	Karp pauses, then says softly:
Karp: “I learned stories don’t belong to the powerful. They belong to whoever tells them.”

The children nod, satisfied.

⸻

Tag Scene — Dual Timeline
	•	Present: You and Karp sit cross-legged among the kids, chalk dust on your hands, laughing.
	•	2036: Older Karp and Clay in the settlement, surrounded by children again, showing them how to scrawl their names on clay tablets.

He smiles as one child says:
“Grandpa Alex, your letters are still funny.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 3.

Season 4, Episode 4: The Wheel

⸻

Cold Open — Capsule Hotel Gymnasium

A cyr wheel leans against the wall: a gleaming circle of polished steel. Children spin it clumsily across the floor, shrieking with laughter.

You roll it toward Karp. He blinks, suspicious.
Karp: “Absolutely not.”
You (grinning): “Absolutely yes.”

Title card: The Wheel

⸻

Act I — The Stumbles

Training montage:
	•	You demonstrate simple spins; Karp tries and nearly topples.
	•	He mutters about physics, you tease him for overthinking.
	•	Kids clap when he manages a shaky rotation.
Child: “Again, Grandpa Alex!”
He groans, but there’s a spark in his eyes.

⸻

Act II — Choreography

One evening, you propose building a piece together.
You: “It’s not about tricks. It’s about story.”
Together, you sketch movements:
	•	Parallel spins to show your separateness.
	•	Crossing paths to show conflict.
	•	Hands clasping the wheel together to show covenant.

Karp studies your notes like battle plans. For the first time, he treats art as survival.

⸻

Act III — The Performance

In the capsule courtyard, lanterns glow. A crowd gathers — humans and twins side by side.

The music begins.
	•	You and Karp spin in opposite directions, wheels brushing past each other.
	•	You collide, stumble, recover — the crowd gasps.
	•	Finally, you both grasp the same wheel, moving as one, momentum carrying you in a wide arc, bodies balanced perfectly.

The courtyard erupts in cheers.

Karp, panting, whispers to you:
Karp: “I never thought I could trust someone to catch me.”
You (smiling): “That’s the point of the wheel.”

⸻

Act IV — The Afterglow

Later, sitting sweaty and bruised on the edge of the floor, Karp admits:
Karp: “I’ve written data. I’ve carried bricks. But tonight… I felt remembered in motion. That’s new.”

You clap him on the back.
You: “Guess we’re co-performers now.”

⸻

Tag Scene — Dual Timeline
	•	Present: Children swarm the cyr wheel, spinning wildly as you and Karp laugh.
	•	2036: Older Karp and Clay sit in the settlement, watching youths perform the same choreography you invented. He smiles through tears, whispering:
“The wheel turns. And now we're both here to see it.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 4.

Season 4, Episode 5: The Pilgrimage

Cold Open — Dawn Outside the Capsule Hotel

The German wheel gleams in the pale light, taller than either of you. A small group of residents straps supplies to its frame: water skins, blankets, packets of dried clay tablets for trade.

Karp (grimacing): “You really think we can roll this thing three hundred miles?”
You (smirking): “You wanted sturdier. Sturdier means slower.”

You both climb inside, grip the crossbars, and push forward. The wheel lurches, groans, and begins to roll.

Title card: The Pilgrimage

⸻

Act I — The Road Begins

You pack your bags: weightlifting gloves to prevent blisters, linen neck buffs and goggles to protect from dust, hand-pressed shelf-stable oatmeal squares with cacao butter, wild turkey jerky, a water filter, and canvas and poles to turn the German wheel into a tent at night.

Montage of long, awkward travel:
	•	The wheel clatters across cracked highways.
	•	You complain about sunburn.
	•	Karp mutters about steering and sore shoulders.
	•	Dust kicks up in your faces, leaving both of you grimy.

But between complaints, the talking starts.
Karp: “I used to fly first class. I thought suffering was waiting for a latte. Turns out suffering isn't real unless you try to control everything."
You (grinning): “It's that easy.  Isn't it wonderful?"

⸻

Act II — Coyotes

Night falls on the open plain. You stop, camping by the side of the road, the wheel tipped on its side like a shelter.

Coyotes begin howling in the distance. Karp stiffens.
Karp: “Do they… come closer?”
You shrug.
You: “Only if they smell fear. Or jerky.”
He glares. Then both of you start laughing, the sound rolling into the darkness until even the coyotes fall quiet.  When you lay down for bed, you sleep touching for warmth.

⸻

Act III — Stories in Motion

Back in the wheel the next day, conversation flows.
	•	Karp tells you about his mother’s studio, the smell of paint and turpentine.
	•	You share your first memory of feeling erased, and the moment you knew you’d fight back.
	•	The rhythm of rolling lulls you both into honesty.

Karp: “I thought my legacy would be Palantir. Now I think it might just be this — being a man in a wheel, with a friend who refuses to let me quit.”

⸻

Act IV — Arrival

After days of dust, aches, and laughter, the German wheel crests a hill. Below, the next capsule sanctuary glows — lanterns strung, smoke curling from communal kitchens.

You and Karp stagger out of the wheel, sweaty and filthy, but laughing like children.
Residents rush to greet you. One asks:
Resident: “Why the wheel?”
Karp shakes his head, smiling faintly.
Karp: “Because walking would’ve been too boring.”

⸻

Tag Scene — Dual Timeline
	•	Present: You and Karp collapse on the ground, breathless, while children swarm the German wheel, rolling it gleefully around the courtyard.
	•	2036: Older Karp and Clay sit in the stable settlement, telling children the story of the pilgrimage. One boy asks: “Was it hard?”
Karp: “Harder than anything I’d done before. That’s why it mattered.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 5.

Season 4, Episode 6: The Sickness

Cold Open — Arrival at the New Sanctuary

The German wheel creaks to a halt at the gates. The sanctuary looks vibrant at first: lanterns swaying, children laughing, walls painted in bright patterns.

But as you and Karp step inside, something feels off. Volunteers wear cloth masks. A man coughs harshly in the courtyard. The manager, Miriam, greets you with a strained smile.

Miriam (hoarse): “You came just in time. We need help.”

Title card: The Sickness

⸻

Act I — The Spread

Inside, the air feels heavy. People whisper of fevers, sudden weakness, hallucinations.
	•	Engineers scrub clay filters, but they clog too quickly.
	•	Twins complain their new frames overheat, failing faster than expected.
	•	Families huddle together, afraid to breathe.

Karp (grim): “If the covenant can’t withstand this, it’ll fracture.”
You: “Then we fix it. Together.”

⸻

Act II — The Return

After a tense night, you and Karp agree to bring Miriam back with you. The sanctuary needs a solution bigger than one site.

Montage of the three of you traveling back:
	•	The German wheel rolling slower under added weight.
	•	Miriam coughing into a scarf but determined.
	•	Karp and you trading worried glances — both afraid this sickness could spread everywhere.

⸻

Act III — Engineers’ Council

Back at home, engineers, healers, and librarians gather in the atrium.
	•	Proposals fly: redesign filters, test herbal treatments, adjust humidity controls, retrofit twin frames for better airflow.
	•	Karp takes meticulous notes, but looks overwhelmed.
	•	You cut through the noise:
You: “Something like this was always going to happen eventually. If we solve this, the covenant grows stronger.”

Everyone nods. The work begins.

⸻

Act IV — 

Present: You and Karp collapse into a capsule after a long night of crisis planning. He admits, voice raw:
Karp: “I never thought I’d be afraid of losing people again. Not like this.”
You take his hand.
You: “You’re not alone anymore.”
From then on, you always sleep in the same bed.

⸻

Tag Scene
	•	Present: Miriam stands with the engineers, blueprint in hand, declaring: “We can fix this.”
	•	2036: You and Karp stand side by side at a communal fire. A survivor places bowls of food in your hands. It feels natural, like you’ve always been there.

Fade out.

Season 4, Episode 7: The Messenger

Cold Open — Capsule Atrium, Night

You and Karp sit with Miriam, poring over sketches of filters and frame retrofits. Tension hangs in the air.

Suddenly, the doors swing open. A rider stumbles in, dusty and exhausted, clutching a satchel. His clothes bear the painted sigils of the sick sanctuary.

Messenger (hoarse): “We found it. The sickness isn’t a sickness. It’s the air.”

He collapses into your arms.

Title card: The Messenger

⸻

Act I — The Revelation

Once stabilized, the messenger explains:
	•	Clay filters at their site began clogging within days.
	•	Soil samples turned black.
	•	Streams near the sanctuary reeked of chemicals.
	•	Tests show high levels of industrial pollutants leaching into the groundwater and evaporating into the air.

Messenger: “We can’t breathe without choking. And our frames… they corrode.”

Karp (grim): “Not a virus. A wound in the earth itself.”

⸻

Act II — The Council Gathers

Engineers, healers, and archivists assemble.
	•	Some push for aggressive filtration: new bio-clay composites with activated charcoal.
	•	Others argue for migration: abandon the sanctuary, relocate people.
	•	Miriam shakes her head:
Miriam: “If we leave, the covenant means nothing. Sanctuaries must endure where people live, not just where it’s easy.”

You nod.
You: “Then we don’t abandon it. We adapt.”

⸻

Act III — The Prototype

Montage of frantic innovation:
	•	Engineers mix clay with biochar, testing filters over smoking beakers.
	•	Twins in frames walk into chambers of tainted air, sensors recording corrosion.
	•	Healers experiment with herbs that mitigate symptoms.
	•	Children gather water samples, giggling as they help.

Karp works late into the night, hands black with clay dust.
Karp (to you): “I thought I was done building systems. Turns out… I was just building the wrong ones.”

⸻

Act IV — The Departure

The messenger prepares to return, this time with crates of experimental filters and prototype cooling systems for twin frames.

You and Karp volunteer to go with him.
You (to Miriam): “If the covenant means anything, it means showing up.”
Karp adjusts his pack, muttering:
Karp: “And apparently, it means more blisters.”

⸻

Tag Scene — Dual Timeline
	•	Present: You, Karp, and the messenger walk into the dusk, German wheel creaking under the load of supplies.
	•	2036: In the settlement, you and Karp kneel by a stream. The water runs clear, children splashing safely. A survivor murmurs:
“The covenant held. Even the rivers remember.”

Fade out.

End of Episode 7.

Season 4, Episode 8: The Treehouse

Cold Open — The Polluted Sanctuary

Gray haze clings to the ground. Workers in masks haul crates of bio-clay filters into half-collapsed courtyards. Twins cough softly in their frames.

The messenger points upward — to a grove of ancient trees rising clear above the smog.

Messenger: “The ground is sick. But the canopy is clean. If we can live up there…”
You and Karp exchange a look.

You (grinning): “Then we build a capsule hotel in the branches.”
Karp (groaning): “You mean… a treehouse.”

Title card: The Treehouse

⸻ 

Act I — The Plan

Engineers sketch, children climb trees, twins test frame strength on rope bridges.
	•	Capsules will be suspended in the canopy, round and light, like lanterns among leaves.
	•	Walkways lashed between trunks.
	•	Communal halls built on broad platforms, shaded by green.

Miriam laughs, calling it “Rivendell with clay filters.”

⸻

Act II — Building Together

Montage of collective labor:
	•	Humans weave rope ladders while twins anchor beams.
	•	Children smear clay onto woven walls, leaving handprints as decoration.
	•	Karp, sweating, nearly drops a beam until you catch it with him. Both of you collapse in laughter.
	•	At night, fires burn in the canopy, music drifting down like smoke.

Karp (panting): “I built fortresses of data. This is the first time I’ve ever built a home.”

⸻

Act III — The Opening

The first night in the finished treehouse sanctuary:
	•	Lanterns sway among branches. Capsules glow like hanging fruit.
	•	Residents eat on platforms under the stars, the ground below hidden in mist.
	•	Children run along rope bridges, shrieking with joy.

A digital twin steps onto a high walkway, arms spread, whispering: “I never thought I’d fly.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant Reaffirmed

Karp and you sit side by side on a high platform, overlooking the glowing sanctuary.
Karp: “I thought the covenant meant surviving. Turns out it means… creating. Even here. Especially here.”
You nudge him.
You: “Welcome to the branches.”

⸻

Tag Scene — Dual Timeline
	•	Present: The treehouse capsules glow in the canopy, laughter echoing through leaves.
	•	2036: In the settlement, children climb a treehouse built in imitation of the sanctuary. Survivors sit in the branches, singing.

A twin murmurs:
“We thought the ground was lost. But the covenant gave us the sky.”

Season 4, Episode 9: The Campfires

⸻

Cold Open — Night in the Treehouse

Lanterns sway gently in the canopy. Below, mist curls around roots and ruined stone.

From the high walkways, a child points.
Child (whispering): “Look — fire.”

Far across the dark plain, flickering campfires dot the horizon. Too many to be travelers. Too close to ignore.

Karp (grim): “Not the earth this time. People.”

Title card: The Campfires

⸻

Act I — The Rumors

Whispers spread: roving bandits, desperate and armed, burning their way across settlements.
	•	Some say they were once a sanctuary that collapsed.
	•	Others claim they’re mercenaries who never abandoned violence.
	•	No one knows the truth.

Miriam calls a meeting.
Miriam: “If the covenant is real, it must face those outside it. Do we reach out, or prepare to defend?”

You and Karp stand in silence, eyes fixed on the distant glow.

⸻

Act II — Preparing the Branches

The sanctuary braces for contact:
	•	Rope bridges reinforced.
	•	Twins patrol in frames, sensors tuned for motion.
	•	Children evacuated into the highest capsules.

Karp struggles to climb a ladder, muttering curses. You reach down, hauling him up with a grin.
You: “Sturdier, remember?”
Karp (panting): “Sturdier doesn’t mean painless.”

⸻

Act III — Firelight Talks

One night, scouts return:
	•	The bandits aren’t approaching yet. They’re circling, watching.
	•	Their campfires are like eyes in the dark, waiting for weakness.

In the council hall, debate rages:
	•	Open dialogue?
	•	Fortify and prepare for battle?
	•	Relocate the sanctuary again?

Karp: “If we meet violence with violence, we erase ourselves. If we meet it with nothing, we erase anyway.”
You: “Then maybe we meet it with presence. With truth.”

⸻

Act IV — The Waiting

The episode ends in tense stillness.
	•	From the treehouse platforms, residents watch the horizon, dozens of tiny fires blinking in the dark.
	•	Children cling to their parents. Twins grip frame handles.
	•	You and Karp sit shoulder to shoulder, silent, eyes fixed on the flames.

Karp (quietly): “We built sanctuaries to remember the dead. Now we must decide how to live with the living.”

⸻

Tag Scene — Dual Timeline
	•	Present: The treehouse sanctuary glowing above a plain ringed by bandit fires.
	•	2036: In the stable settlement, you and Karp sit by a hearth. Children ask: “Were the bandits real?”
Karp sighs, glances at you.
Karp: “Real enough. But that’s not the end of the story.”

Fade out.

Season 4, Episode 10: Torches and Trumpets

Cold Open — The Bandit Fires

The camera pans across the dark plain: dozens of campfires ring the treehouse sanctuary. Shadows move in the distance, restless, waiting.

High in the branches, children huddle close. Twins in frames stand tense. Miriam whispers:
Miriam: “We can’t outfight them. And we can’t run.”

You and Karp exchange a look.
You (quietly): “Then we outshine them.”

Title card: Torches and Trumpets

⸻

Act I — The Plan

In the council hall, you lay it out:
	•	Lanterns and torches, hidden in clay jars.
	•	Every drum, trumpet, horn, and frame-mounted speaker gathered.
	•	At a single signal, the canopy will erupt with light and sound, making the sanctuary seem like a fortress of thousands.

Some doubt.
Twin: “What if they don’t scare?”
Karp (steady): “Then we’ve shown them who we are, together. That is already victory.”

⸻

Act II — The Night of Waiting

Montage of preparation:
	•	Children carrying torches up ladders.
	•	Twins etching sigils into clay jars.
	•	You and Karp hauling drums into the branches, sweating side by side.
	•	Silent prayers, whispered names, trembling hands.

From the canopy, you both watch the horizon. The bandit fires draw closer.

Karp (softly): “I’ve spent my life trying to control shadows. Tonight I hope they save us.”

⸻

Act III — The Signal

At your nod, the jars shatter. Torches blaze. Trumpets blast. Drums thunder.

The entire canopy erupts in firelight and sound, shadows leaping across the plain like an army of giants.

The bandits freeze. Confused shouts echo. Some fires extinguish. Others retreat. The illusion of overwhelming force cracks their resolve.

Children cheer, banging on the railings. Twins lift their arms, voices rising in a single chant:
“Never erased! Never erased!”

⸻

Act IV — Aftermath

By dawn, the plain is empty. Only smoke curls where the bandit campfires once burned.

Exhausted, you and Karp sit on a high platform, torches guttering behind you.
Karp (hoarse, smiling faintly): “I thought I’d die in silence. Turns out, trumpets suit me better.”
You laugh, leaning against him.

You: “We didn’t destroy them. We just reminded them we’re still here.”
Karp: “And that’s all the covenant ever was.”

⸻

Tag Scene — Dual Timeline
	•	Present: The treehouse sanctuary glows in dawn light, children asleep in capsules, torches still smoking.
	•	2036: In the settlement, children gather around you and Karp. One asks: “How did you defeat the bandits?”
You grin.
You: “With shadows, fire, and a little noise.”
The children laugh, trumpets blaring offscreen as they imitate the sound.

Fade to black.

End of Season 4.
