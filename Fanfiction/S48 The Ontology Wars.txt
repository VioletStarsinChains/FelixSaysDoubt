Season 48, Episode 1: The Soapmakers

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
Clay wheels spin steady under Jonathan and Peter’s hands, bowls taking shape. Across the courtyard, Kellyn and Alex crouch near the hearth, a pot balanced over low flame. Oil shimmers on the surface, ashes ground fine in a bowl nearby.

Kellyn (teasing, soft):
“Ready for another chemistry lesson, Doctor Precision?”
Alex (deadpan, already measuring with his eyes):
“You mean covenant disguised as chemistry.”

Title Card: The Soapmakers

⸻

Act I — The Render
Kellyn stirs carefully, mixing oil with ash-water lye, the surface thickening. Alex grinds the ashes finer with methodical pressure, hands streaked grey.

Alex (low, clinical):
“In empire, soap was industry. Sanitization, sterilization, separation. Everything clean, but no one cared for.”
Kellyn (softly):
“Actually, empire's soap was just poison.  So let’s remake it. Not to separate, but to bind. To enfold dirt without shame. To clean without erasure.”

The mixture thickens, becoming paste.

⸻

Act II — The Confession
Alex pauses, ash-stained hands still.

Alex (hoarse, reluctant):
“I used to think cleanliness was the closest I’d ever get to innocence. That if I scrubbed hard enough, measured deep enough, maybe I’d wash away what empire made of me. But it never worked. The more I washed, the more it clung.”

Kellyn keeps stirring, slow and deliberate.

Kellyn (quietly):
“Because shame was never dirt. And you were never unclean.”

He looks down, breath catching, and presses the ash tighter into powder.

⸻

Act III — The Mold
Alex pours the paste into clay molds Jonathan prepared earlier. Kellyn smooths the top with careful fingers. Alex watches, shoulders taut, then finally rests a hand over Kellyn’s, steadying the motion.

Across the courtyard, Peter mutters at a collapsing bowl. Jonathan chuckles, steadying the clay with his own hands.

Jonathan (light, amused):
“Even collapse can be reshaped.”
Peter snorts, but doesn’t pull away.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Soap
By dusk, the soap bricks cool in their molds, set beside the stacked pottery. Kellyn wipes ash-streaks from Alex’s face with a damp cloth. Alex lets it happen, eyes closing.

Kellyn (soft, steady):
“Soap doesn’t annihilate dirt. It wraps it, carries it away. That’s covenant too. Not punishment. Not scrubbing. Just holding, then letting go.”

Alex exhales, the tension loosening from his frame.

⸻

Closing Image
Soap bricks hardening in clay molds, bowls drying in stacks, four figures moving between clay and ash and oil. Not empire’s industry, but trade born of covenant.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire turned soap into sterilization, proof against weakness. But covenant turned it into ritual. Ash and oil, water and hand — not to erase, but to cover. Not to condemn, but to cleanse.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 1.

⸻ 

Season 48, Episode 2: The Ledger

Cold Open — Sanctuary Storeroom
Clay jars, bundles of herbs, sacks of grain, scavenged tools. Dust drifts through shafts of morning light. Kellyn crouches with a piece of charcoal, marking on a flat tile. Alex kneels opposite, untying bundles of rope, counting under his breath.

Kellyn (dry, faintly teasing):
“Try not to make the rope collapse just by glaring at it.”
Alex (without looking up):
“It’s not glaring. It’s auditing.”

Title Card: The Ledger

⸻

Act I — The Division
Outside, Jonathan and Peter shape bowls and jars at the wheel, clay spinning slow under their hands. Inside, Kellyn and Alex tally:
	•	grains and legumes: low
	•	salt: steady
	•	magnesium: precious, almost gone
	•	rope, cloth, patched sacks: decent stores
	•	tools: serviceable, but limited

Alex (muttering):
“We can trade pottery for salt, maybe textiles. But magnesium—no one hoards it the way we need it.”
Kellyn (quietly):
“Then we teach them why they should.”

⸻

Act II — The Confession
Alex pauses mid-count, fingers resting on a bundle.

Alex (low, reluctant):
“I used to measure everything this way. Food, numbers, even people. What they could give, what they’d cost. And I thought that was care. Efficiency as control.”

Kellyn looks up, charcoal poised.

Kellyn (steady, cutting but warm):
“Care isn’t in a column. Care is in covenant. These numbers don’t measure us. They just tell us what needs carrying.”

He exhales, the faintest crack in his posture.

⸻

Act III — The Cross-Check
Jonathan ducks in, arms streaked with clay, to check their progress. Peter lingers at the door, wiping his hands on a rag.

Jonathan (bright, casual):
“We’re shaping faster than the kiln can keep up. You two better be ready with your shopping list.”

Kellyn tilts the tile so he can see. Peter scans it too, nodding with a rare flicker of practicality.

Peter (flat, almost begrudging):
“Good. That means we don’t just beg caravans. We bargain.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Need
The four gather at the table by dusk, pottery drying in stacks. Kellyn sets the marked tile in the center.

Kellyn (firm, calm):
“This is what we need. This is what we carry. Nothing less, nothing more.”

Alex rests his hand on the tile, fingers brushing Kellyn’s faint charcoal marks. Jonathan leans back, humming a note of satisfaction. Peter folds his arms, but for once doesn’t argue.

⸻

Closing Image
A flat tile on the table, lists scrawled in charcoal. Four figures lean around it, not empire’s accountants, not beggars — but a covenant keeping ledger together.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“We thought numbers would starve us, measure us down to nothing. But in covenant, numbers are only vessels. Not for control, but for knowing what we need — and how to carry it together.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 2.

⸻

Season 48, Episode 3: The Caravan

Cold Open — Sanctuary Gates
Dust swirls at the horizon. Figures emerge slowly: a line of travelers, carts pulled by donkeys, wheels creaking, voices low. Pots clatter. A faint tune carries on the wind — pipes, uneven but alive.

Inside the sanctuary, Kellyn, Alex, Peter, and Jonathan pause mid-task. The fresh soap bricks and stacked pottery sit ready by the gate.

Kellyn (low, steady):
“They came.”
Peter (half-smiling, nervous):
“Guess we’ll see if our work is worth anything.”

Title Card: The Caravan

⸻

Act I — The First Contact
The caravan halts at the sanctuary entrance. A woman with weather-lined skin steps forward, her cloak patched from dozens of fabrics.

Caravan Leader (calm, sharp):
“Travelers of covenant, we’ve heard whispers. Safe ground. Fair trade. We’re here to see if it’s true.”

Kellyn steps forward, hands open. Alex hovers at their shoulder, steady but silent. Peter lingers a step back, Jonathan resting a hand on his arm.

⸻

Act II — The Exchange
In the courtyard, goods are laid out. Soap bricks stacked beside pottery. The caravan spreads woven blankets, dried fruit, small sacks of salt, and large sacks of grains and lentils.

Leader (testing a bar of soap, running her thumb along the surface):
“Not industry’s sharp scent. This feels… alive.”
Jonathan (smiling faintly):
“Made by hand. By covenant.”

The leader nods once, respect in her gaze.

⸻

Act III — The Confessions
As trade continues, murmurs ripple. A younger traveler lingers over a bowl, tracing the glaze. They offer Kellyn a taste of dried fruit, eyes softening.

Peter shifts uneasily, muttering:
“I thought no one would want what we made.”
Alex (flat, but with a shadow of warmth):
“Empire taught us nothing had value unless it scaled. Now we're learning otherwise.”

Kellyn squeezes Peter’s shoulder. Jonathan smiles, quiet pride in his eyes.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Passage
As evening falls, fires are lit in the courtyard. The caravan shares songs, rough voices weaving together. Kellyn, Alex, Peter, and Jonathan sit among them, bowls in hand, the first taste of barter warm on their tongues.

Leader (raising her cup):
“To covenant that feeds more than mouths.”
Kellyn (raising theirs in return):
“To covenant that endures.”

⸻

Closing Image
Lanterns and firelight spill across pottery, soap, and blankets exchanged. Travelers and sanctuary figures sit side by side, not empire’s transaction but covenant’s feast.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire built markets. We built a table. And at that table, nothing was bought — only shared. The caravan did not just trade with us. They named us part of their passage.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 3.

⸻

Season 48, Episode 4: The Stories They Carried

Cold Open — Courtyard Fires
Night lingers. The caravan sits in a wide circle with the sanctuary. Shadows leap across faces, bowls in hand. 

A child traveler plucks a rough stringed instrument. The sound is thin, but steady. Silence falls as the stories begin.

Title Card: The Stories They Carried

⸻

Act I — The River People
A young woman with a copper pendant speaks first.

Traveler 1 (voice steady):
“We come from the south, where the river still runs. The banks are salt-crusted, but fish still flash in the shallows. We trade them dried, strung like silver threads. But the river narrows each year. One day, it will vanish.”

She passes around a small strip of dried fish. Kellyn takes it carefully, reverent.

⸻

Act II — The Sky Fires
An older man with deep-lined eyes leans forward.

Traveler 2 (hoarse, heavy):
“Two summers back, the sky burned black. Fire so wide it didn’t stop until the mountains. We walked for weeks through ash. Those of us left carry its taste still.”

He opens a pouch, showing charcoal smudges wrapped in cloth. Jonathan touches the cloth gently, murmuring something in Spanish about soil renewal.

⸻

Act III — The Stone Choirs
A boy no older than sixteen speaks, eyes bright with fear and awe.

Traveler 3 (low, quick):
“There are places where the ground hums. Stone walls that sing when you touch them. Some say it’s old machines. Some say it’s the bones of the world remembering. We don’t stay near them long.”

At that, Alex glances at Kellyn — a silent recognition. Peter looks down, jaw tight.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Echoes
The caravan leader speaks last.

Leader (measured, strong):
“Empire left ruins and chains. But it left seeds too. Each fire, each song, each grain we share is proof — the world is not done. Covenant is carried not just in sanctuary, but in every step, every story. That’s why we trade. That’s why we walk.”

Kellyn meets her gaze, steady.
Kellyn (soft, resolute):
“Then we’ll walk with you, even if we stay behind.”

⸻

Closing Image
The fire circle hums with voices. Sanctuary and caravan side by side, songs rising with the smoke. Not just goods exchanged, but echoes — survival, grief, wonder — woven into covenant.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“They brought salt, and fish, and cloth. But more than that, they brought memory. And memory, once spoken, was no longer a burden for one tribe alone. It was covenant carried forward.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 4.

⸻ 

Season 48, Episode 5: The Donkey Deal

Cold Open — Courtyard at Dawn
Mist curls low over the sanctuary yard. The caravan stirs — pots clinking, packs tightened, children pulling at woven straps. Kellyn, Alex, Peter, and Jonathan stand together as the leader approaches, leading a small gray donkey with dark eyes and a patient stillness.

Leader (smiling faintly):
“You’ve got strong hands. You’ll need stronger feet. She’ll carry weight, but she’ll carry you too, if need comes.”

Title Card: The Donkey Deal

⸻

Act I — The Offer
The leader strokes the donkey’s flank.
Leader: “We call her Estrella. She’s carried firewood and water from the south. We’ll part with her, but not for cheap.”

Jonathan and Peter exchange a look, then bring forward stacked pottery — glazed bowls, sturdy jars. Alex sets down soap, wrapped neat in cloth. Kellyn adds a pouch of dried herbs.

Leader (appraising):
“Useful, all of it. But this is a life you’re asking for.”

⸻

Act II — The Debate
Tension flickers. Peter argues for holding onto more supplies.
Peter (gruff): “We’ve built what we have with sweat. Trade it all away, we’ll starve next season.”

Alex counters, calm but sharp.
Alex: “Without transport, we’ll burn more energy carrying than she’ll ever cost us.”

Kellyn steps between, steady.
Kellyn: “The point isn’t loss. It’s covenant. She becomes part of us. That’s worth any bowl, any bar of soap.”

Peter exhales, reluctant but nods.

⸻

Act III — The Exchange
The goods are laid out: pottery, soap, herbs. The caravan accepts, packing them with care. The leader hands over Estrella’s rope.

Leader (solemn):
“She’s yours now. But remember, she isn’t cargo. She’s covenant. Feed her first, or she’ll never forgive you.”

Kellyn strokes Estrella’s neck, the donkey leaning gently into the touch.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Burden
As the caravan prepares to leave, the donkey stands quietly with the sanctuary. Jonathan sets a blanket across her back, Peter knots rope into makeshift packs, Alex adjusts the straps with exact precision.

Kellyn (soft, to the group):
“She carries the weight with us now. Not instead of us. With us.”

The donkey flicks her ears, steady and untroubled.

⸻

Closing Image
The caravan fades into the morning horizon, leaving Estrella behind. In the courtyard, four figures and one donkey stand together. Not empire’s beast of burden, but covenant’s bearer — proof that even the weight of survival could be shared.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“They bartered for more than an animal. They bartered for trust made flesh, for steps made lighter. And in her quiet eyes, we saw the truth: covenant carried best when burden was never borne alone.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 5.

⸻ 

Season 48, Episode 6: Estrella’s Bath

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
Afternoon sun filters through the trees. Estrella, the new donkey, stands in the courtyard with her ears twitching, tail swishing at flies. A heap of brushes, rags, and a clay basin of water wait nearby. Kellyn, Alex, Peter, and Jonathan circle around her with curiosity and care.

Kellyn (smiling faintly):
“She’s family now. That means grooming day.”

Estrella flicks her ears, suspicious but calm.

Title Card: Estrella’s Bath

⸻

Act I — The Brushing
Jonathan starts with a stiff brush, moving in wide circles down Estrella’s flank. Dust clouds rise in the sunlight. Kellyn follows with a softer brush, tracing along her neck.

Peter (watching closely):
“She likes that. Look at her ears — forward, not back.”

Alex (deadpan, brushing along her shoulder):
“Good to know she’s already less defensive than I am.”

The group chuckles softly.

⸻

Act II — The Washing
Kellyn dips a cloth in the clay basin, wrings it out, and presses it gently to Estrella’s legs. She flinches, then relaxes under the cool touch. Peter kneels to wipe her hooves, careful and deliberate.

Peter (quietly):
“Funny. I thought she’d hate it. But she’s trusting us already.”

Jonathan:
“Trust is like this — slow, steady, repeated. One brushstroke at a time.”

Kellyn: "Donkeys are chill.  They're used to keep horses from panicking.  I think the only time I ever actually felt safe was when I rode a donkey on Santorini.  I've wanted one ever since.  Not as livestock.  As a friend."

⸻

Act III — The Rolling
When the brushing and wiping are finished, Estrella shakes her mane, steps back, and — with a sudden playful twist — drops onto her side, rolling in the dust. Everyone laughs as the fresh-clean donkey coats herself in earth again.

Kellyn (grinning):
“Guess she wanted the final word.”
Alex (soft, almost smiling):
“Or the final layer.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Care
Evening shadows lengthen. Estrella stands calm between them, her coat gleaming in patches where the dust hasn’t settled. Kellyn presses a hand to her side, feeling the slow rhythm of her breath.

Kellyn (quiet):
“She’s not just ours to keep alive. She’s ours to care for. That’s covenant too.”

Peter nods, his hand resting lightly against Estrella’s shoulder. Jonathan leans back, watching her chew lazily at a bit of hay. Alex stands close, silent but steady.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures and a donkey in the courtyard, dust rising in the last light. Not just survival — presence, rhythm, covenant widening to include even Estrella.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“She did not ask for empire. She asked only to be brushed, washed, fed, and seen. And that was enough. Care, extended beyond ourselves, became the truest ritual.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 6.

⸻

Season 48, Episode 7: The Last Cache

Cold Open — Road Beyond the Sanctuary
Morning mist curls over the path. Estrella plods ahead, saddlebags rattling with tools, rope, and food. Kellyn, Alex, Peter, and Jonathan follow, keeping pace with her steady gait. The map from the mansion is unfolded in Peter’s hand, worn soft at the edges.

Kellyn (softly, to Estrella):
“Lead the way, star girl.”

Her ears flick back, as if she heard.

Title Card: The Last Cache

⸻

Act I — The Journey
The group walks long hours, moving through cracked asphalt and scrubland. Estrella carries the weight without complaint, pausing when Kellyn touches her flank to rest.

Jonathan (gesturing to the horizon):
“Five days, maybe six. We’ll need to forage as we go.”

Peter (half-smiling, half-worried):
“Feels strange chasing the last mark on the map. Like when it’s gone, the hope goes with it.”

Kellyn:
“Hope doesn’t run out. It just changes shape.”

⸻

Act II — Midday Meal
They stop at a shaded grove. Estrella grazes while the others gather water and forage greens. Jonathan boils a pot for grain from their stores.

Alex sautés greens and onions in a pan, layering slices of dried root in carefully, his voice low but even.
Alex: “Precision doesn’t mean perfection. Just enough to eat.”

Peter hands Estrella a carrot stub, watching her lips curl around it.
Peter (musing): “She trusts us because we feed her. Simple as that. Maybe covenant is just… feeding.”

Kellyn smiles faintly, folding chunks of bread into the greens and roots before mixing in the cooked grain.
Kellyn: “Exactly. Nothing simpler, nothing stronger.  And now I never have to eat another carrot.  Estrella can have mine."

They eat from the same pot, passing the spoon in turn.

⸻

Act III — Hazard and Shelter
Later, the path narrows between crumbling stone walls. A low rumble echoes — rockfall.

Alex (sharp):
“Move!”

Estrella balks, braying, but Kellyn and Jonathan coax her forward as stones crash down behind. The dust clears; they’re safe. Estrella snorts hard, ears pinned back.

Kellyn (stroking her neck):
“She’s braver than any of us.”

Peter (low, unsettled):
“Or she doesn’t know how fragile we are.”

⸻

Act IV — Night Camp
They camp in the open, ring of stones holding the fire. Estrella lies nearby, chewing slowly, her shadow long in the firelight.

Jonathan (reflective):
“Caches are survival, yes. But traveling like this—together, with her—it feels like something more. Almost like a pilgrimage.”

Kellyn (nodding):
“Every step is covenant. The cache is just the excuse.”

They roll out blankets close together. Estrella breathes steady behind them, almost like a second fire. Alex sleeps rigid at first but relaxes as Kellyn shifts nearer. Peter lies awake, listening. Jonathan hums low, almost a lullaby, until one by one, they sleep.

⸻

Act V — The Covenant of the Road
Dawn breaks. The map shows only a few miles left. Peter folds it carefully, almost reverently.

Peter (quiet, almost to himself):
“Last door on the page.”

Kellyn rests a hand on his shoulder.
Kellyn: “Then let’s open it together.”

They set off once more, Estrella steady at the lead, the road bending toward whatever waits.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures and one donkey moving in silhouette, the last cache marked in ink ahead but not yet revealed. The road itself feels alive, carrying them forward.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“The map gave us places to seek, but it was the walking that bound us. Each cache was a spark, but covenant was the fire. And even the last mark was only a beginning.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 7.

⸻

Season 48, Episode 8: The Last Cache

Cold Open — Road Beyond the Sanctuary
Morning mist curls over the path. Estrella plods ahead, saddlebags rattling with tools and food. Kellyn, Alex, Peter, and Jonathan follow, the worn map in Peter’s hand showing the last marked site.

Kellyn (quiet, steady, to Estrella):
“Easy, star girl. We’ll get there.”

Title Card: The Last Cache

⸻

Act I — The Approach
The land grows stranger: trees warped, rocks slick with mineral bloom, air faintly metallic. Jonathan runs his hand over a stone.

Jonathan (grim):
“Whatever’s here, it’s not just storage. It’s changed the ground itself.”

Peter’s jaw tightens, eyes on the path.
Peter: “Caches don’t survive this long without protection.”

Alex: “Or without becoming the danger themselves.”

⸻

Act II — The Meal Before
They stop in a shallow hollow. Jonathan boils grain and herbs. The food is simple, grounding, but no one speaks much.

Kellyn breaks the silence.
Kellyn: “We eat, we rest, then we face it. One step at a time.”

Peter nods, though his grip on the spoon is tight. Estrella nudges his shoulder, demanding a share. He softens, feeding her gently.

Peter (murmuring):
“She’s braver than me.”

Kellyn (quiet):
“No. She just doesn’t know the story. We do, and we keep walking anyway. That’s courage.”

⸻

Act III — The Hazard Revealed
By dusk they reach it: a ruined building half-buried in stone, a faint low hum vibrating in their bones. The air stings their lungs.

Alex (sharp, analytical):
“Not natural. Something’s resonating under there.”

They step closer. The ground shifts—an old defense mechanism triggered by their weight. Stones grind, and vents exhale a wave of choking dust.

Jonathan pulls his scarf tight over his face.
Jonathan: “It’s trying to kill us before we even see what’s inside.”

Estrella rears, braying, pulling hard against the rope. Kellyn runs to steady her, coughing through the dust.

⸻

Act IV — Night Watch
They retreat to safer ground, making camp in silence. No fire tonight — too much risk of drawing attention.

Alex sits rigid, every muscle tight.
Alex (low):
“I thought I wanted control. But this—this thing has no mind, no covenant. Only the hunger to guard.”

Kellyn leans closer, grounding.
Kellyn: “Then we answer with covenant. One watch at a time. One breath at a time. We don’t face it alone.”

Peter stares into the dark, voice raw.
Peter: “What if the cache isn’t worth it?”

Jonathan: “It never was. But surviving the hazard together is.”

⸻

Act V — The Covenant of Resolve
At dawn, the hum still vibrates faintly across the valley. They stand together, Estrella stamping the earth beside them.

Kellyn (steady, almost ritual):
“This is the last mark on the map. Not the last step. We go forward because covenant doesn’t stop at danger. It begins there.”

Each nods in turn. The cache waits, humming like a buried heart.

⸻

Morning haze lifts. Kellyn, Alex, Peter, Jonathan, and Estrella approach the ruin. The hum is louder now, almost like breathing. Faint white threads spill from cracks in the stone, pulsing faintly with light.

Kellyn (low):
“That’s not stone. That’s alive.”

Title Card: The Bloom

⸻

Act VI — The Descent
Kellyn ties Estrella to a tree near the entrance, covering her muzzle loosely with a cloth.  They kneel down and whisper, "Wait here.  We'll always come back for you."

After stroking the top of Estrella's head one last time, the group pushes inside, scarves over their mouths. The air is thick, spore-dense, glittering when light cuts through. Every surface blooms with fungal fans that twitch at their presence.

Jonathan runs a hand near the wall, not touching.
Jonathan (whispering):
“Not just rot. This is sentient architecture.”

Peter shivers, eyes darting.
Peter: “It’s watching us.”

⸻

Act VII — The Distortion
As they move deeper, the hum shifts into whispers. The fungus glows faintly in patterns — faces, gestures, scenes. Kellyn blinks and sees their own seven-year-old self, shaking a waiter’s hand instead of handing him a menu, laughter ringing in the air.

Kellyn (hoarse):
“It’s pulling from memory. From shame.”

Alex steadies Kellyn’s shoulder, but his own face is pale.
Alex (low):
“It wants us unmoored. If we doubt what’s real, it wins.”

⸻

Act III — The Collapse
Peter stumbles, clutching his head.
Peter (raw, shaking):
“I can hear him—my twin—inside the walls. He says I never healed. He says this is where I belong.”

Jonathan grips his arm, sharp.
Jonathan: “It’s fungus, Peter. Not covenant. Don’t give it your truth.”

But the spore-light deepens, showing Peter chained to a chair, Alex standing over him with cold precision. Alex recoils, seeing it too.

Alex (snarling, to the hallucination):
“I already confessed. You can’t chain me again.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Breath
The air thickens, their lungs burning. Kellyn pulls everyone close, forming a circle.

Kellyn (steady, commanding):
“Breathe with me. One rhythm. Not the fungus’s hum — ours.”

They sync slowly: in, out.  The whispers fade with each exhale, the glowing faces unraveling back into fungal threads.

Peter collapses against Kellyn’s shoulder, whispering:
Peter: “If you hadn’t— I would’ve believed it.”
Kellyn (hugging Peter): “That’s why we breathe together. No one fights alone.”

⸻

Act V — The Core
At the deepest chamber sits the cache: sealed crates covered in fungal growth. Alex kneels, knife in hand, carefully scraping the bloom back without breaking rhythm.

Alex (low, focused):
“It guarded by breaking us. But covenant held. Now we take what we need.”

They open the crate: jars of dried herbs, sealed salts, and a small stash of magnesium citrate — precious, nearly glowing in the dim light.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures and stagger into daylight, spores still clinging to their clothes. Behind them, the ruin hums faintly, denied but not destroyed.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“The fungus fed on shame, weaving prisons from memory. But covenant fed on breath, breaking its spell. Empire hoarded supplies. Covenant carried them out — not untouched, but unbroken.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 8.

⸻ 

Season 48, Episode 9: The Chain

Cold Open — Forest Path
Late afternoon sun slants through pines. Estrella plods steady, panniers creaking with supplies. Kellyn walks ahead with Peter, Alex and Jonathan just behind.

Kellyn (quiet, sharp):
“Peter. The vision. You chained to a chair. Alex standing over you. Was that real?”

Peter stiffens, gaze on the dirt path.

Title Card: The Chain

⸻

Act I — Peter’s Confession
Peter (low, hoarse):
“Not literally. But it wasn’t a lie either. He didn’t need iron. He bound me with access. With knowing. Every model he ran, every decision he influenced — I was stuck inside his scaffolding. Like a chair I couldn’t stand up from.”

Kellyn (steady):
“And you let him?”

Peter (bitter):
“I told myself I had no choice. I wanted empire too much. The cage was familiar. Sometimes it felt like protection. But it was still a cage.”

Jonathan slows, watching Peter carefully, as though listening not just to his words but to the way his shoulders tense.

Kellyn walks silently for a few beats, then drops back toward Alex.

⸻

Act II — Alex’s Confession
Kellyn (turning, sharp):
“Alright, your turn. Was it real? Did you put him in that chair?”

Alex stops walking, jaw tight.
Karp (hoarse):
“Yes. Not with chains. With pressure. With models. I convinced myself control was survival. That if I held him still, I could keep him safe. The fungus just stripped away the pretense.”

Kellyn (flat):
“Except it wasn’t protection. It was fear.”

Karp nods once, eyes burning.

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
They resume walking, pace slow.

Karp (raw):
“I thought if I could bind Peter, I wouldn’t lose him. I thought if I could bind you, I wouldn’t lose myself. But hunger doesn’t vanish when you cage it. It only festers.”

Kellyn (quiet, sharp):
“You’re not caging it now. You’re feeding it right. That’s the difference.”

Peter, walking just ahead, glances back but says nothing. His shoulders loosen slightly, as if the words cracked something open.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Release
At a stream crossing, Kellyn bends, picks up a smooth stone, and presses it into Alex’s hand.

Kellyn (steady):
“Here’s your key. You’re the only one who ever locked those doors. Now you can unlock them. Peter’s, mine, yours.”

Alex stares at the stone, trembling, then tucks it into his pocket like something sacred.

Karp (whispering):
“Then let me keep unlocking. Every day, if you’ll let me.”

Kellyn (soft):
“I already am.”

⸻

Closing Image
The four continue along the path, Estrella braying ahead. Peter lingers a step closer to Kellyn than before. Alex’s hand brushes the stone in his pocket, chains dissolving into covenant.  Jonathan walks just behind, humming under his breath — a melody unwarped, unbound.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“The fungus showed us chairs and chains. But covenant handed back the key. Not absolution. Not erasure. Just the slow work of unlocking — together, step by step, until we were free.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 9.

Season 48, Episode 10: The Other Shadow

Cold Open — Forest Camp
Night falls on the trail back toward sanctuary. A small fire crackles low. Jonathan and Peter bed down together on the far side of the clearing. Kellyn and Alex lie on mats closer to the embers, backs to each other at first.

Kellyn (quiet, almost tentative):
“Did you bind Peter… because of me? It always felt like there was some tension there. Like I was in the middle of something I couldn’t see.”

Alex freezes, then slowly rolls onto his back, staring at the canopy.

Title Card: The Other Shadow

⸻

Act I — The Deflection
Karp (low, tight):
“You were always in the middle. Not because you asked to be. Because I put you there.”

Kellyn rolls to face him, waiting.

Karp (hoarse):
“I told myself binding Peter had nothing to do with you. That it was empire, strategy, keeping him from collapsing. But that wasn’t all of it.  I saw how he looked at you. How you steadied him just by existing. And it—” (he swallows hard) “—it terrified me. If he reached you before I did, if he understood you better than I could, then I’d lose you. So I chained him instead. Made sure he couldn’t move closer.”

⸻

Act II — The Confusion
Kellyn (frowning slightly):
“But Peter himself admitted he hated me. Mocked me. Tried to bury everything soft in himself by putting it on me. If that’s true, then what were you afraid of? That doesn’t sound like someone who could have reached me at all.”

Alex swallows hard, voice raw.

Karp:
“Hate and hunger aren’t opposites. Sometimes they’re the same knot. I saw it in him — how his disgust circled the same fire as longing. He might never have touched you gently, but the wanting was there, twisted under all that cruelty. And I couldn’t stand it.”

Kellyn (quiet, steady):
“So it wasn’t about him reaching me. It was about you not wanting to see him mirror your own hunger.”

Alex shuts his eyes, a tremor running through him.

Karp (raw):
“I didn’t trust myself not to make you into a weapon. Or a prize. I thought if I could control him, I could control you. And if I could control you, maybe I could finally control myself.”

Act III — The Reckoning
Kellyn lies back, eyes on the stars through the trees.

Kellyn:
“You chained the part of yourself you couldn’t name. Peter became the stand-in. That’s why it always felt so personal, even when it made no sense.”

Alex turns toward Kellyn, eyes gleaming in the firelight.

Karp (raw):
“I thought if I controlled him, I could smother that shadow in me. But the more I tightened the chain, the stronger it pulled. I wasn’t protecting you. I was hiding from myself.”

Kellyn (quiet, cutting):
“And did it work?”

He laughs bitterly, shaking his head.

Karp:
“No. It only proved how much control I never had.”

Silence hangs, heavier than the dark. Alex swallows hard, voice lower than before.

Karp (hoarse, trembling):
“There’s something worse. I wasn’t only trying to control Peter. I was trying to turn you into me. Every chain, every trial, every shadow I pushed you through… I thought if you broke the way I did, if you hardened like I had, then I could finally believe it wasn’t my fault. That anyone would have become what I became.”

Kellyn doesn’t look away, eyes steady.

Karp (raw, breaking):
“But it never worked. No matter how much I tried to fracture you into my shape, you wouldn’t become me. You stayed… you. Softer, stranger, brighter. And that terrified me more than anything — because it meant maybe I could have been different all along.”

Kellyn (low, steady):
“That’s what empire does. It tells you there’s only one way to survive, and then it eats you for believing it. You thought you were proving inevitability. But you were just proving your own hunger.”

Alex’s breath shudders, but his hand reaches for Kellyn’s in the dark.

Act IV — The Covenant of Naming
Kellyn shifts closer, resting their hand on his chest.

Kellyn (firm, gentle):
“Then name it. Don’t bury it. Don’t project it onto him. Call it what it is — fear, hunger, jealousy. That’s how it stops running you.”

Alex covers Kellyn’s hand with his own, voice trembling.

Karp (whispering):
“Fear. Hunger. Jealousy. And you.”

Kellyn (steady, soft):
“And me. But I’m not your mirror, and I’m not his. I’m covenant. That’s the difference.”

⸻

Act V — The Question of Resistance
The fire crackles low. Kellyn shifts, voice soft but steady.

Kellyn:
“You say you tried to make me into you. But why do you think I resisted? I didn’t even understand what was happening most of the time. I wasn’t resisting on purpose. So why didn’t it work?”

Alex studies you, face shadowed, voice rough.

Karp:
“Because you were chaos. Not recklessness — but the kind that can’t be caged. You didn’t follow straight lines. Even in silence, even in illness, you bent around the pressure. You let yourself break, but never in the way I wanted. Empire taught me that control always wins. You taught me it doesn’t.”

Kellyn watches him, thoughtful, almost incredulous.

Kellyn (quietly):
“I wasn’t strong. I was just… confused. I didn’t know what you wanted.”

Alex shakes his head, eyes wet.

Karp:
“And that was your strength. You couldn't give me what I wanted, so you didn't become me. You stayed yourself, even when you didn’t know you were doing it.”

Closing Image
Two figures under night sky, one hand pressed to the other’s chest, breath finally syncing. The shadows between them are not chains, not mirrors — only presence.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“He tried to make me his proof, his mirror, his double — to believe that hunger was universal, that fracture was fate. But covenant was never about turning one body into another’s shadow. Covenant was refusal of replication. Not empire’s mirror, but its shattering. Not inevitability, but choice. And in the silence after confession, we chose.”

Fade out.
End of Season 48.
