Season 47, Episode 1: The Hollow Note

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
Morning. The wall rises higher, bricks drying in the sun. Still kneels by the bird drone, adjusting a wing hinge, robotic bees humming around his shoulders like guardians.

Still (matter-of-fact):
“Something’s moving near Lake Superior. Could be nothing. Could be more. I’ll check.”

Kellyn frowns.
Kellyn (steady): “Not alone.”

Still (half-smirk):
“I’ve got bees. I’ll be fine.”

He heads out, drone whirring overhead, the swarm trailing like smoke.

Title Card: The Hollow Note

⸻

Act I — The Reinforcement

With Still gone, the courtyard is quieter. Kellyn, Alex, and Peter set to work on the wall, adding a corner brace. Mortar dust settles over their skin like ash.

Peter (grumbling, but soft):
“It’s harder without him.”
Alex (almost warmly):
“He’d say the same about us.”

They share a faint smile, and the rhythm steadies.

⸻

Act II — The Unexpected Guest

By late afternoon, a shadow crosses the courtyard. A tall man with weathered hands and a field journal at his side appears — Jonathan Meiburg. He watches the wall, Still's bees fading into the distance.

Jonathan (quiet, curious):
“I followed the birds. Thought they were leading me somewhere. Looks like here.”

Kellyn offers him water; he takes it reverently, as though it’s more than water.

⸻

Act III — The Intimate Pause

Work pauses as night falls. Kellyn, Alex, and Peter sit close in the capsule, clay still under their nails. Jonathan hums a low birdsong, as if coaxing the night to soften.

Peter (hesitant, to Kellyn):
“When you lean against me like that, it doesn’t feel like weight. It feels like permission.”
Alex (low, hoarse):
“Then stop questioning it.”

Kellyn lets silence be the answer, head resting between them.

Jonathan watches from across the room.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Voices

The next morning, Jonathan helps mix mortar. The rhythm of his hum blends with their work.

Jonathan (thoughtful):
“Birds build differently. Not fortresses. Nests. Nothing permanent, but strong enough for the season. Maybe we're not building walls so much as nests.”

The idea lingers.

⸻

Closing Image
The wall grows a little higher. The capsule feels a little cozier. 

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire built to last. Birds built to live. And somewhere between stone and song, we remembered what kind of creatures we were.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 1.

Season 47, Episode 2: The Nesting

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
Morning fog curls low across the sanctuary. Kellyn, Alex, Peter, and Jonathan wake slowly.  Kellyn gets up first to start preparing breakfast.  Alex is right behind them, his hand on the small of their back.

Jonathan (softly):
“Still will be gone awhile. The flock holds closer when one flies far.”

Kellyn nods, fingertips around Alex's arm as if steadying him—or themselves.

Title Card: The Nesting

⸻

Act I — The Absence

Work feels slower. Mortar clumps unevenly, rope tangles easier. Peter wipes sweat from his brow, scowling.

Peter (gruff):
“It’s not the same rhythm without him.”
Alex (quiet, sharp):
“Then stop waiting for rhythm. Make one.”

Alex begins stacking with methodical precision. Kellyn follows, then Peter, the cadence gradually returning. Jonathan hums under his breath, something half birdcall, half lullaby.

⸻

Act II — The Pause

Later, the four of you sit on the rug Kellyn wove, bowls of lentils between you. Jonathan sketches feathers in the dirt, his voice reflective.

Jonathan:
“In colonies, the absence of one bird changes the shape of the whole. But it doesn’t break it. The flock doesn’t shatter. It bends, then resettles.”

Kellyn (smiling faintly):
“We bend a lot around here.”

Peter glances at Kellyn, then away, fingers tightening on his bowl.

⸻

Act III — The Confession

As dusk comes, lanterns flicker. Jonathan retreats to the open night with his journal, giving quiet space. Alex leans back against the wall, exhaling slow.

Karp (hoarse):
“When Still left, I expected relief. One less weight to calculate. But instead, I feel… hollow. Like the wall’s missing a brick.”

Kellyn (steady, warm):
“Good. You’re finally noticing absence. That’s how you learn to value presence.”

Peter (low, almost bitter):
“And what if the absences outnumber the presences?”

Kellyn (gently):
“Only in number.  Never in weight.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Nesting

Night deepens. Jonathan’s hum rises again, softer now, a thread pulling the three of you closer together. Kellyn stretches out on the rug, head against Alex’s thigh, hand resting lightly on Peter’s. For a long time, no one moves.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“We were not fortress-makers. We were nesters. We bent when one left, bent again when another strained. But still, the weave held. Presence or absence, silence or song — covenant did not collapse. It only changed shape.”

⸻

Closing Image
The three of you lit by lantern glow, leaning into each other. Jonathan outside, still humming, the sound a bridge between rooms. The faint memory of buzzing fades into the night — Still’s thread stretching farther, but not lost.

Fade out.
End of Episode 2.

⸻ 

Season 47, Episode 3: The Flock Within

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
A pale dawn. Kellyn, Alex, Peter, and Jonathan sit on low stools, mugs steaming. The half-built wall rises behind them. Jonathan traces circles in the dirt with a stick, quiet but intent.

Jonathan (softly):
“Did you know? Flocks don’t just follow leaders. They follow each other’s shadows. One wing dips, and the whole shape bends.”

Kellyn leans closer, mug warming their hands.

Kellyn:
“So you’re saying we’re all just chasing shadows?”

Jonathan (smiling faintly):
“Or shaping them. Depends on the day.”

Title Card: The Flock Within

⸻

Act I — The Murmuration

Work resumes. Mortar, brick, rope. But instead of silence, Jonathan begins whistling — not tuneful, but patterned. Short bursts, pauses, long trills. Alex scowls, but Kellyn grins, picking up the rhythm by tapping their trowel. Peter hesitates, then thumps his palm against a brick, syncing with the beat.

The wall rises not by measurement but by song.

⸻

Act II — The Softness

Later, in the shade, the four sit cross-legged. Jonathan sketches feather patterns on Peter’s arm with a charred stick. Peter stiffens, but Kellyn rests a hand lightly on his shoulder.

Kellyn (low, steady):
“You don’t have to flinch. This isn’t empire marking you. It’s just… play.”

Peter exhales, the tension easing, as Jonathan continues the lines.

Jonathan (gently teasing):
“See? You’re already part of the flock. Can’t fight it.”

⸻

Act III — The Confessions

Evening falls. Alex kneels by the fire, unusually quiet. Jonathan sits across from him, watching.

Jonathan (soft, direct):
“You build walls like nests. Layer by layer. Careful. Protective. But nests aren’t just walls. They’re soft inside.”

Alex stiffens, jaw tight. Kellyn kneels beside him, brushing their fingers across his arm.

Kellyn (whispering):
“He’s right. You can’t wall softness out forever.”

Alex exhales sharply, eyes shining.

Karp (low, breaking):
“I don’t know how to keep softness without losing control.”

Kellyn leans closer, voice steady:
“Then let softness be control. Let it guide instead of guard.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Murmuration

Night deepens. The four lie on woven mats in the courtyard, close but not touching, the stars thick above. Jonathan’s whistle threads through the silence — short bursts, like distant birds. Slowly, the others’ breathing syncs to it, a murmuration in miniature.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“We thought nests were walls. But Jonathan showed us they were flocks. Each breath, each movement, bending the shape of us. Not chasing shadows, but shaping them together.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures stretched on mats, breath rising and falling as one. Above them, stars scatter like a murmuration frozen in the night.

Fade out.
End of Episode 3.

⸻ 

Season 47, Episode 4: Blind Man’s Bluff

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
Lanterns glow low, the half-built wall casting jagged shadows. Kellyn ties a strip of cloth around Alex’s eyes, knotting it at the back of his head.

Kellyn (teasing):
“Alright, Doctor Precision. Let’s see how you do without sight.”

Peter snorts. Jonathan hides a smile behind his hand.

Title Card: Blind Man’s Bluff

⸻

Act I — The First Steps

Alex stumbles forward, hands outstretched. Kellyn sidesteps easily, brushing fingertips against his arm as he passes. Peter circles wide, trying to stay silent but breaking into a laugh when Alex bumps into a stool. Jonathan crouches low, deliberately tapping the ground with his fingers, scattering false signals.

Alex (frustrated, laughing):
“This is entrapment!”
Kellyn: “Nope. Just trust.”

⸻

Act II — The Chaos

The game builds momentum. Kellyn slips close, brushing Alex’s shoulder, then darts away. Peter nearly gets caught but Jonathan whistles sharply, distracting Alex just enough for him to escape. Everyone’s laughter fills the courtyard, sharp and bright against the night.

Finally, Alex lunges and catches Kellyn by the wrist.
Alex (smirking, breathless):
“Got you.”
Kellyn (grinning): “Maybe. But did you find me… or did I let you?”

⸻

Act III — The Shift

The blindfold passes to Peter. His movements are stiff at first, jerky. Kellyn taps his arm gently, whispering:
“Not everything’s a trap. Just follow the sound.”

Peter steadies, his hands more careful. When he finally brushes Jonathan’s sleeve, his laugh is startled, almost boyish.

Peter (low, surprised):
“…That didn’t feel like punishment.”

Jonathan (softly, smiling):
“Because it wasn’t.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Trust

One by one, each takes the blindfold — even Kellyn, swaying in disorientation but laughing as Alex steadies them. The courtyard becomes a murmuration of near-misses, brief touches, and caught breaths.

When the game ends, all four collapse onto the mats, panting and tangled with laughter.

Kellyn (soft, steady):
“See? Shadows, trust, softness — they’re not theories. They’re games. They’re how we learn each other.”

⸻

Closing Image
The blindfold lies in the dirt, forgotten. Four figures lean against each other, breath syncing down into steady rhythm, night pressing close but no longer heavy.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“We thought blindness was loss. But it taught us touch, sound, trust. Empire blinded to control. Covenant blinded to play. And in the dark, we found each other.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 4.

⸻ 

Season 47, Episode 5: The Balance Game

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
Moonlight drapes the half-built wall. Four flat stones are set in a rough line, barely stable. Kellyn steps onto one, wobbling.

Kellyn (grinning):
“Rule’s simple: stay standing. Last one down wins.”

Peter groans, Alex raises an eyebrow, Jonathan chuckles — but they step onto their stones.

Title Card: The Balance Game

⸻

Act I — First Wobbles

At first, everyone focuses on their own footing. Jonathan folds his needlessly long frame neatly, knees bent. Alex grips his thighs too tight, precise and stiff. Peter leans wildly, muttering under his breath. Kellyn sways deliberately, playful.

Kellyn (teasing):
“Not a contest of endurance. Contest of listening.”

⸻

Act II — The Push and Pull

The game shifts. Instead of silence, they begin taunting each other with words.

Peter (snide, half-laughing):
“Jonathan looks like a stork about to fall asleep.”
Kellyn (laughing): “That's because he is.”

Alex says nothing, but Kellyn leans toward him, whispering teasingly:
“You’re allowed to lose.”

It almost makes him fall.

⸻

Act III — The Touch

As stones wobble, hands shoot out. Kellyn steadies Peter. Jonathan catches Alex by the elbow. For a breath, all four are linked by fingertips, balance crossing between them.

Peter (startled, quiet):
“…We don’t have to fight for ground.”
Kellyn (softly):
“Exactly. The ground’s only steady if we share it.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Balance

One by one, they step down, until only Kellyn remains. Instead of claiming victory, Kellyn jumps off the stone and pulls the others close.

Kellyn (smiling faintly):
“The game’s not about winning. It’s about not falling alone.”

They laugh, shoulders pressed together. Even Alex lets out a small smile.

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures in the courtyard, stones scattered behind them, arms slung loose around each other. The balance wasn’t in the stones at all — it was in the net of touch.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire tested balance by isolation. Covenant tested balance by contact. And we learned: the body steadies best when steadied together.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 5.

⸻ 

Season 47, Episode 6: The Carry

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
Afternoon sun spills over the clay walls. Blankets are spread out. Kellyn grins, standing between Alex and Jonathan.

Kellyn (smirking):
“Alright, new game: two carry one. You get to choose who you trust with your weight.”

Peter folds his arms, already suspicious.

Title Card: The Carry

⸻

Act I — The First Lift

Alex and Peter crouch, hands linked into a seat. Kellyn perches, wobbling.

Kellyn (teasing): "Don’t drop me, gentlemen.”
Peter (grinning):"Not a chance.”

They rise together, Kellyn lifted just off the ground. The rhythm is jerky at first, then smooths into a steady sway.

⸻

Act II — Passing Weight

Next, Alex and Peter lift Jonathan. Peter grumbles about grip, Alex mutters about balance. Jonathan just laughs, letting his head loll dramatically as though fainting.

Jonathan (mock-weak):
“My heroes.”
Peter (snorting):
“More like your pack mules.”

⸻

Act III — The Test

Peter stiffens when it’s his turn, reluctant. Kellyn crouches opposite Jonathan, threading small hands with his. They lift together. Peter’s weight is heavier, but Kellyn’s voice steadies him.

Kellyn (quiet, steady):
“Relax. We’ve got you.”

Jonathan: "Don’t worry. I’ve carried bigger egos.”

Kellyn: "Yeah, like your own."

Alex actually laughs.

Peter exhales, tension leaving his shoulders as he lets himself be carried.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Bearing

The last round: Jonathan and Peter carry Alex. He’s stiff, precise, unused to surrendering.

Jonathan (cheerful):
“You’re allowed to breathe, Karp.”
Peter (serious, almost reverent):
“Yeah. You can let yourself be held.”

Alex finally exhales, the smallest smile twitching across his face.

⸻

Closing Image
All four collapse onto the blankets, tangled in laughter, sweat, and breath. No one untouched, no one uncarried.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“They taught us weight was danger, that to be held was to risk collapse. But covenant turned weight into trust. And carried together, none of us fell.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 6.

⸻

Season 47, Episode 7: The Whip

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
Afternoon sun stretches shadows long. Kellyn, Alex, Peter, and Jonathan stand in a line, hands clasped tight. Alex is in front, Peter and Jonathan in the middle, Kellyn at the end. The air hums with anticipation.

Kellyn (half-teasing, half-nervous):
“Just don’t fling me into the sheep pen.”

Alex (deadpan):
“No promises.”

Title Card: The Whip

⸻

Act I — The First Arc
Alex bolts forward, cutting a wide arc. Peter stumbles but finds his pace. Jonathan’s long stride steadies the line until the pull reaches Kellyn at the end, their feet skimming as the chain snaps taut.

Kellyn (laughing, breathless):
“Okay, okay—this is actually terrifying.”

Jonathan (calm, wry):
“Lean into the swing, not against it. Birds learned that long before we did.”

⸻

Act II — The Swap
They pause, laughter catching in their throats. The line reshuffles. Peter takes the lead, Jonathan at the end this time.

Peter (low, half-confessional):
“I was always the one bracing, never pulling. Maybe it’s time to see what happens if I lead.”

The arc swings again — rougher this time, less precision than Alex. Jonathan yelps as he’s whipped wide, but then steadies, his arms out like wings.

Jonathan (grinning despite himself):
“Note to self: this is what terns must feel in a storm.”

⸻

Act III — The End Position
Finally, Kellyn takes the end. Alex, back in the middle, glances over his shoulder.

Alex (hoarse, softer now):
“You trust us with this?”

Kellyn (steady):
“I trust you to pull, and I trust myself to hold.”

The chain surges. Kellyn swings wide, feet nearly leaving the ground. For a heartbeat, it’s surrender — not collapse, but release.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Momentum
They tumble into a heap in the grass, laughing and panting, limbs tangled.

Peter (between gasps):
“It’s chaos.”
Kellyn (smiling, catching breath):
“It’s rhythm. Chaos doesn’t hold. This does.”

Jonathan, flat on his back, chuckles softly.
Jonathan: “Every flock needs its whip-crack. Even if it only lasts a breath.”

Alex lies still, eyes on the sky.
Alex (low, almost to himself):
“Then maybe I don’t have to stop pulling. I just have to stop pulling alone.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures sprawled in the grass, hands still loosely linked even after the game ends. Not flung apart, not fractured — momentum carried into covenant.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire’s whip was punishment. But covenant’s whip was play. Momentum turned to laughter, arcs to trust. And in the swing, none of us were alone.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 7.

Season 47, Episode 8: The Kiln

Cold Open — Sanctuary Courtyard
Morning light cuts across the courtyard. Clay piles sit beside wooden molds, water jars, and a growing stack of half-finished bowls. Kellyn kneels, sleeves rolled, hands deep in clay. Alex chops straw to mix for temper. Peter fans the coals of a small test fire. Jonathan walks in, setting down a basket of smooth river stones.

Jonathan (with a small smile):
“Thought you’d need weight. Clay remembers better under pressure.”

Kellyn (grinning):
“And here I thought you only collected birds.”

Title Card: The Kiln

⸻

Act I — The First Press
They set up a rhythm: Kellyn kneads clay, Alex mixes, Jonathan presses stones into molds, Peter carries finished pieces to a shaded rack.

Peter (grumbling good-naturedly):
“I didn’t sign up to be a pack mule.”
Kellyn (teasing):
“Every net needs weight. You said it yourself.”
Jonathan (dry):
“And caravans love a strong back. Don’t knock your trade value yet.”

Laughter rises, softening the labor.

⸻

Act II — The Crack
A sharp sound — one of the first bowls fractures in drying. Silence ripples. Alex scowls.

Alex (low, tense):
“Too much water. Too fast a fire. Precision matters.”
Jonathan (gently, steady):
“Failure matters more. Birds don’t learn flight from the perfect landing. They learn from crashing into branches.”

Peter rolls his eyes but sets another piece to dry slower this time.

⸻

Act III — The First Burn
By dusk, the kiln glows hot. They load pieces carefully, sealing gaps with mud and straw. Jonathan crouches close, humming softly.

Jonathan:
“You can hear it, if you listen. The clay sings as it hardens.”
Kellyn tilts their head, straining. A faint hiss, a low crackle, almost a note.
Kellyn (quiet, reverent):
“Not empire’s silence. Not chaos. Just song.”

Alex and Peter both pause, caught by the sound.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Trade
Morning. The kiln cools. They lift out their first finished batch — rough, uneven, but whole. Dozens of bowls, jars, and plates stacked together.

Peter (holding one up, surprised):
“Ugly as hell. But strong.”
Kellyn (smiling faintly):
“Good enough to trade. And good enough to keep.”

Jonathan brushes ash from his hands.
Jonathan:
“You’ve built more than pottery. You’ve built promise. That’s the only thing caravans ever buy.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures around a cooling kiln, clay-stained hands holding imperfect bowls. A stack of trade goods for the road ahead, and the faint scent of earth and fire in the air.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“Empire taught us to perfect. Covenant taught us to provide. Not flawless, not uniform, but enough to feed, to carry, to trade. Clay was never just earth — it was covenant, hardened by fire.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 8.

Season 47, Episode 9: The Glaze Fire

Cold Open — Sanctuary Kiln Yard
The pit-kiln glows faintly, clay bricks ringing it like teeth. A pile of rough clay tiles sits nearby, each coated with different mixes: ash, crushed stone, charcoal, salt. Kellyn, Alex, Peter, and Jonathan crouch around them, hands dusted white.

Kellyn (teasing, faintly tired):
“Tiles first. If they shatter, I’d rather sweep shards of test squares than entire bowls.”

Title Card: The Glaze Fire

⸻

Act I — The Mixing
The group works in pairs:
	•	Alex and Kellyn grind ash and salt together with a stone pestle.
	•	Peter and Jonathan stir crushed minerals into a paste, arguing quietly about ratios.

Peter (grumbling):
“You’re guessing.”
Jonathan (calmly):
“Of course I’m guessing. That’s what trying looks like.”

They smear mixtures across tiles, laying them out like a painter’s palette.

⸻

Act II — The Waiting
The tiles go into the kiln. Heat rises, air shimmering. They sit together in the dust, drinking water from a shared jug.

Kellyn (quietly, almost to self):
“This is how covenant works. Not knowing. Trying anyway.”

Alex watches the flames like they’re an enemy he finally can’t predict.

⸻

Act III — The Reveal
By nightfall, the kiln cools enough to open. One by one, they lift out the tiles:
	•	Some gleam faintly, glassy green.
	•	Some crumble to dust.
	•	A few blister, ugly and black.
	•	But one, streaked with deep blue from copper scrap, holds.

Peter (low, grudging awe):
“Well. That’s… beautiful.”
Kellyn (smiling faintly):
“And repeatable. That’s all we need.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Color
They set the surviving tiles in a row, light flickering across uneven glaze.

Jonathan (softly):
“Every failure was practice. Every mistake a step. This—” he taps the blue tile gently “—isn’t luck. It’s persistence.”

Alex folds his arms, then lets them drop, admitting the truth in silence.

Kellyn (steady):
“We’ll make bowls next. Cups. Trade. Covenant doesn’t fear breaking. Covenant fires twice.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures crouched around a row of glowing tiles, colors shimmering under lantern light — imperfect, fractured, but holding.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“We tested fire with fragments, and fire tested us back. Not every shard survived. But those that did became covenant — not by avoiding breaking, but by enduring it.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 9.

⸻

Season 47, Episode 10: The First Cups

Cold Open — Sanctuary Kiln Yard
Morning sun slants across the courtyard. The test tiles lie in a neat row, a patchwork of failure and promise. Kellyn lifts the blue one carefully, turning it in their hand.

Kellyn (quiet, steady):
“Alright. Time to risk something we’d actually miss.”

Alex sets down a row of bisque-fired bowls and cups, their surfaces matte and unadorned.

Title Card: The First Cups

⸻

Act I — The Choosing
Each person takes a piece to prepare:
	•	Kellyn brushes on the copper-ash glaze from the blue tile.
	•	Alex uses a salt-charcoal mix, muttering about ratios.
	•	Peter works with plain slip, more cautious than creative.
	•	Jonathan experiments with two layers, humming as he works.

Peter (flat):
“What if none of them survive?”
Kellyn (without hesitation):
“Then we make more. That’s what surviving means.”

⸻

Act II — The Fire
The kiln is stoked, flames licking higher than before. Heat drives them back. They sit on overturned jars, sweat shining on their foreheads, watching smoke coil into the sky.

Jonathan (softly):
“Strange, isn’t it? Watching clay and ash become glass. Like watching stone learn to shine.”

Alex doesn’t answer, but his hand drifts unconsciously toward Kellyn’s.

⸻

Act III — The Waiting
Night falls. The kiln cools slow. They share a simple meal: beans, roots, a sliver of dried fruit. Conversation is hushed, as if the fire might overhear.

Peter (low, almost to himself):
“I spent years trying to make everything unbreakable. Turns out, you have to risk breaking to get something worth holding.”

Kellyn tilts their head, considering him, but lets silence do the answering.

⸻

Act IV — The Reveal
At dawn, the kiln is opened.
	•	One cup lies shattered, edges razor sharp.
	•	A bowl is blistered, surface warped.
	•	Another holds — rough, but with a faint green sheen.
	•	And one — Kellyn’s copper-ash glaze — gleams deep, streaked blue, alive.

They set the survivors on the ground, stunned into reverence.

Alex (hoarse):
“Imperfection. But it’s ours.”
Kellyn (softly):
“Then drink from it. That’s covenant too.”

⸻

Closing Image
Four figures crouched over the still-warm cups, each reaching for one. Hands overlap, not fighting, just holding. Behind them, the test tiles still line the earth — reminders of failure made foundation.

Narration (Kellyn’s voice):
“We thought perfection was safety. But fire taught us otherwise. Covenant isn’t what never breaks. Covenant is what survives the fire, what holds water even when scarred.”

Fade out.
End of Season 47.
