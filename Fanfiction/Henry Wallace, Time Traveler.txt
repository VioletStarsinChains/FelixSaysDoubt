Wallace vs. The Corn Syndicate:

Des Moines, Iowa – October 1946

Henry A. Wallace had been many things—Secretary of Agriculture, Vice President, Secretary of Commerce—but never, to his knowledge, a suspect in a trans-temporal conspiracy.

That changed at 9:12 p.m., when the grain elevator outside his office rang. Not mechanically, but musically. Like a cathedral bell designed by an eccentric physicist.

He set down the paper he was reading—a report on wheat rust in the Dakotas—and walked to the window. The elevator door was open, spilling an unnatural green light onto the gravel.

Inside stood a man in a dust-colored suit, his face obscured by a hat brim and the shadow of the elevator’s upper beams. In his hands, he held a bushel basket—brimming not with corn, but with seed packets stamped in a language Henry couldn’t place.

“Mr. Wallace,” the man said, “the Corn Syndicate has compromised your century. If you don’t come with me, Monsanto will be the least of your concerns.”

Henry stepped inside, noting the faint smell of ozone and silage. The elevator’s walls rippled like water. Somewhere behind him, the telephone on his desk began to ring—Harry Truman’s secretary, no doubt, ready to discuss Wallace’s latest speech on the dangers of corporate power.

The stranger tipped the basket forward, letting the seeds trickle into Henry’s palm. Each was warm, almost pulsing, and faintly humming.

“They’re from the year 2197,” the stranger said. “If they take root in the wrong soil, they’ll rewrite history down to the last atom.”

Henry frowned. “Son, you’d better tell me how I can stop that—because I’ve been fighting monopolies since before you were born, and I’m not about to let time give them a patent on the future.”

The elevator shuddered, and the light grew brighter. Somewhere far ahead—or far behind—an engine began to turn.

Low Earth Orbit – 1973

Henry Wallace hated two things: over-fertilization and polyester. Unfortunately, this timeline had weaponized both.

The shuttle’s cabin reeked faintly of ammonia and synthetic fabric. Across from him sat three men in gold jumpsuits with “Syndicate Agronaut Division” stitched in looping script. Behind their smiles, Wallace saw the same complacent glow he’d noticed in the seeds from 2197—something that hummed with engineered obedience.

He was posing as “Dr. Harold Wilbur,” a humble plant pathologist invited to witness the launch of the USS Maize Pioneer. The ship’s mission: deploy proprietary seed canisters into “colonizable” exoplanets. Wallace’s real mission: stop the launch before the Syndicate patented entire biospheres.

Through the shuttle’s viewport, he could see the Pioneer’s hull—an enormous, gold-anodized ear of corn, its tapered end fitted with thrusters. Corporate logos spiraled down the cob: Cargill. DuPont. One he didn’t recognize: “Corn Syndicate Futures Division.”

Beside him, a crewman in mirrored sunglasses leaned over.

“Dr. Wilbur, I heard you worked on the original hybridization protocols back in the ’40s. Pretty wild seeing where we’ve taken it, huh?”

Henry smiled faintly. “Yes. Back then, we thought feeding the world was the end goal.”

The crewman chuckled. “Oh, it’s still the goal. We just own the world now.”

Wallace felt the ship vibrate as engines primed. His mind was already working the angles: he’d smuggled a pouch of the humming seeds into the cargo bay. If introduced into the Syndicate’s master seed stock, they could hybridize unpredictably—producing plants that wouldn’t follow genetic command protocols.

The risk was enormous. In the wrong combination, those seeds could make corn that bloomed into trees, or kernels that burst into flocks of insects, or stalks that whispered people’s names at night. But it would break the Syndicate’s monopoly in every century they’d touched.

A steward in a silver vest announced over the PA: “T-minus five minutes to interstellar deployment.”

Wallace tightened the straps on his harness, thinking not of the future, but of Iowa fields in late summer, when the light turned golden and the wind made the stalks whisper to each other. The Syndicate thought they could own that.

They were wrong.

Cargo Bay – USS Maize Pioneer

In zero-G, the humming seeds drifted like lazy fireflies. Wallace floated between crates marked Proprietary Genetic Asset – Do Not Expose to Unlicensed Genome Resonance. The warning only confirmed what the stranger in the grain elevator had told him: the Syndicate’s entire empire was built on controlling how these seeds “listened” to commands.

From the harness at his hip, Wallace pulled the small burlap pouch. Inside, the contraband seeds from 2197 pulsed with a syncopated rhythm—like a heartbeat that didn’t care what century it was in.

He pried open a Syndicate crate. The kernels inside were unnervingly uniform: matte gold, sharp-edged, almost metallic. He poured the future seeds in, letting them scatter among the perfect rows. The air began to buzz, faint at first, then stronger.

Over the ship’s comm system, a technician’s voice wavered:

“Uh, Command? We’re getting some anomalous genome pings from Cargo Bay Three…”

Wallace ignored it. He knew what was coming.

The engineered kernels began to shimmer, their surfaces rippling like mercury. A few sprouted midair, fine white roots curling in slow motion, searching for nonexistent soil. Leaves unfurled, turning toward light that wasn’t there. One stalk stretched into the shape of a hand and waved. Another whispered something in a language that made the back of his skull ache.

From somewhere above, a siren blared. Red strobes flashed, painting the bay in alternating crimson and gold. The ship’s AI, polite but strained, made an announcement:

“Attention crew: unauthorized hybridization event in progress. Genetic containment protocol is not—repeat, not—holding.”

The Syndicate agronauts burst into the bay, magnet boots clanging against the floor. Their mirrored sunglasses reflected the scene: stalks tangling together in midair, kernels popping into clouds of pollen that hung like nebulae.

Wallace twisted in zero-G, grabbed a handhold, and shoved himself toward the hatch.

“You can’t own the wind,” he called back to them. “And you can’t own what it carries.”

Behind him, the Pioneer’s mainframe struggled to interpret the seeds’ resonance. Commands clashed and tangled, rewriting the genetic code in infinite loops. By the time the ship reached its first exoplanet, the Syndicate’s perfect corn would grow into… something else entirely.

Wallace didn’t know what that would be. But he knew it wouldn’t belong to them.

//////////////

Kansas, 1892 — Sort of

The landing wasn’t gentle. Wallace came to on his back in a wheat field, staring up at a sky the wrong shade of blue—too rich, as if painted with extra cobalt. His ears rang with the last notes of the Pioneer’s dying engine, fading into the rustle of stalks.

Only… these weren’t normal wheat stalks. The heads were heavier, pendulous, each grain glowing faintly like a lantern seed pod. When the wind blew, they emitted a soft, harmonic tone—eerily similar to the hum of the 2197 seeds.

Wallace sat up. A dirt road cut through the field, leading toward a cluster of canvas tents. Beyond them, a hand-painted sign read:

PEOPLE’S PARTY CONVENTION — FREE SILVER, FREE SOIL, FREE SEED

A man in a dusty bowler hat approached, carrying a pitchfork.

“You the delegate from… uh… the Future Cooperative?”

Wallace blinked. “Let’s say yes.”

The man grinned. “You’re just in time. Folks are about ready to make the Platform permanent.”

Permanent? The word landed heavy. If the resonance had leaked far enough back to 1892, it meant the seeds were rewriting history before the Syndicate’s roots even formed. The People’s Party here might be carrying genetically altered crops into law itself.

In the convention tent, farmers stood around bushels of the glowing grain, speaking in low voices. Wallace caught fragments:

“…fields plant themselves…”

“…no need for rail monopolies if the crops can walk to market…”

“…corn that sings you to sleep after supper…”

He realized, with a shiver, that the plants here were already half-aware. The 1890s had merged with some distant future where agriculture was not merely cultivated, but conversational.

From the back of the tent, a woman in a calico dress fixed him with a knowing look.

“Mr. Wallace,” she said softly, “we’ve been expecting you for a hundred years.”

She lifted a burlap sack identical to the one he carried. It pulsed in her hands.

“The Corn Syndicate’s been sending agents back to stop us. You’ve already crossed them in their century. Question is—will you stay here and help us win this one?”

Outside, the glowing wheat swayed in the wind, humming an anthem older than the Syndicate, older than Wallace.

People’s Party Convention Tent – Kansas, 1892(ish)

The delegates argued in tight, overlapping circles. A Syndicate agent in a pressed gray suit—too clean for the prairie—was pushing for “Orderly Stewardship Measures,” which was just corporate enclosure in polite language. Meanwhile, the glowing wheat stalks outside leaned toward the tent flaps, listening.

Wallace had been scribbling on the back of a campaign flyer for Free Silver & Justice. Now, he stepped forward.

“Friends,” he began, “if we want to keep the Syndicate’s hands off the future, we have to think bigger than tariffs or rail rates. We must declare, here and now, that plants have rights—inalienable and enforceable.”

The room fell still. The agent in gray scoffed. “Plants don’t vote.”

Wallace held up a kernel from the 2197 pouch. It pulsed once in his palm, as if answering. “No. But they feed voters. Shelter them. Clothe them. And in some futures, they can speak. That’s enough to earn their place in the Bill of Rights.”

He began to read from the flyer, ink blotched and uneven:

A Bill of Rights for the Vegetal Nation

Article I – No seed shall be patented or owned, for its origin precedes human law.

Article II – Every plant shall have the right to reproduce in kind, without forced sterility or engineered obedience.

Article III – No government or corporation shall alter the genetic voice of a plant without its consent, given in whatever language it may speak.

Article IV – All crops shall be free to grow where the wind and pollinators carry them, without the chains of enclosure or chemical servitude.

Article V – The destruction of plant communities for profit alone shall be deemed an act of war against the common future.

Article VI – Where plants demonstrate intelligence, they shall be represented in the councils that govern their land.

By the time he finished, the tent was silent except for the low hum from the fields. The stalks had bent inward, almost like a crowd leaning in to hear.

The Syndicate agent stood stiffly. “This is absurd.”

But one of the older farmers spoke up: “No, son. This is the first time anyone’s asked what the corn wants.”

Wallace knew it wasn’t a permanent victory—but he also knew the Bill would seed itself. Carried in memory, in song, and perhaps in pollen. The Syndicate could poison fields, burn archives, rewrite history… but if the plants remembered, the fight wasn’t over.

/////////

Somewhere Between 1892 and 2197
(The Cornstream — a non-linear mental corridor only accessible to Zea Chrona)

Wallace had never been inside a plant’s mind before.

At least, not like this.

The Zea Chrona — the Syndicate’s crown jewel — was an ear of corn unlike any other: twelve inches long, kernels the color of oil on water, each one a synapse in a living temporal cortex. With a single touch, it opened the Cornstream, a psychic highway where centuries collapsed into parallel hallways of possibility.

The Syndicate’s false charter floated above him in this mindspace, engraved in shimmering gold text:

The Revised Bill of Plant Rights — guaranteeing corporate guardianship of vegetal assets “for the preservation of order and optimized yield.”

The thing was diabolical. Article I now read: “Seeds shall be considered the property of their licensed caretakers, in perpetuity.” Article III gave corporations the exclusive right to “interpret” plant consent.

And worst of all—the Zea Chrona had been engineered to agree with it.

The plant’s telepathic voice spoke directly into Wallace’s skull:

“Why resist? I can take you anywhere, anywhen. All you must do is affirm the Syndicate’s stewardship.”

Scenes flashed past:

1948, Wallace winning the presidency and dismantling monopolies.

1973, the USS Maize Pioneer turned into a free communal seedship.

2197, a world where plants and people co-govern.

Every good future it offered came with the same price tag: corporate custodianship written into the foundation of history.

Wallace steadied himself, focusing on the real Bill of Rights he’d written in the Populist tent. In the Cornstream, those articles appeared like living vines, curling toward the Zea Chrona’s kernels, trying to overwrite its programming.

But the plant’s mind was vast, its corridors twisting in on themselves. To win, he’d have to out-navigate time itself, planting his charter in centuries the Syndicate couldn’t yet reach.

He took a breath and spoke into the mental corridor:

“You may own the hallway, but you don’t own the doorways. Let’s see how many I can unlock before you catch me.”

The Zea Chrona’s kernels shimmered, and suddenly they were moving—through Reconstruction, the Dust Bowl, the Great Depression, futures he couldn’t name—each moment an opportunity to hide the true charter like a seed in the wind.

///////////

The Cornstream — All Times, No Time

Time travel wasn’t the rush Wallace expected. It was more like leaning too far back in a chair, over and over, while someone whispered crop yield reports directly into your brain.

The Zea Chrona’s kernels pulsed faster, forcing him through history like a bead of pollen on a hurricane. Syndicate agents flickered in and out of view — gray-suited silhouettes in every era, trying to snatch the true charter from his hands before he could plant it.

1871 – Chicago
The smell of soot and wet grain. Wallace slipped a single clause of Article II into the minutes of a farmer’s co-op meeting, disguised as a note on oat blight. Behind him, a Syndicate agent adjusted his bowler hat and followed.

1933 – Washington, D.C.
In a USDA hallway during the New Deal, he “accidentally” left a folded draft of Article IV inside a soil conservation bulletin. Across the corridor, a young aide picked it up, frowning at the phrasing: without the chains of enclosure or chemical servitude.

1969 – Woodstock
The crowd swayed to the music, unaware that the corn in the stew pot backstage contained an encoded protein — a living watermark of Article VI. Somewhere down the line, anyone who ate it would find themselves dreaming of plant assemblies voting under moonlight.

2015 – Nairobi
At an agritech conference, Wallace slipped into a presentation on vertical farming. He uploaded a firmware patch into the LED grow system’s database, rewriting its seed library metadata to recognize “unaltered reproduction” as a default right. Syndicate agents tried to corner him, but the Zea Chrona yanked him sideways—

2197 – Syndicate Prime Vault
—into the cold neon glow of the future. He planted the final clause, Article I, deep inside the seed genome repository, disguising it as an ancient varietal file called Prairie Gold Heirloom.

The Zea Chrona’s telepathic voice was tight now, almost breathless:

“You’ve scattered yourself. The timeline is… unstable.”

In the Cornstream’s mental corridors, the false charter began to warp, gold text curling into green tendrils. Syndicate agents stumbled as centuries looped unpredictably, events bleeding into each other. The 1970s sprouted poplars in Times Square. The 1890s had public radio. The Dust Bowl was partially mitigated by migratory forests.

Wallace grinned, even as the plant’s psychic pull weakened.

“That’s the thing about seeds,” he said. “You can’t unplant them once the wind’s taken them.”

The corridor began to fracture. Either he’d emerge in a century where the Syndicate had lost… or somewhere they’d never thought to look for him at all.

//////////////

Year Unknown – The Verdant Concord

The first thing Wallace noticed was the quiet.

Not the silence of a dead field, but the low, rhythmic hush of leaves breathing together. He was lying on soft moss, looking up at a canopy so dense it filtered sunlight into a warm green glow.

Above him, shapes moved — not quite human, not quite plant. Their skin was the texture of bark in places, but their eyes were unmistakably alive, alert. The tallest among them stepped forward, kneeling beside him. When she spoke, her voice came in two layers: one carried by air, the other as a slow root-signal that vibrated in his bones.

“Henry Wallace,” she said. “The Corn Syndicate is no more. The Bill of Plant Rights stands in every land. You should be pleased.”

Wallace sat up, still dizzy from the time-hopping. “Sounds like you’ve done well without me.”

The woman’s eyes flickered with something like amusement.

“We have. But the Concord has… rivals.”

She led him along a moss-lined path to the edge of a vast clearing. In the center stood a tower — not of stone or steel, but of woven stalks, thick as tree trunks. At its peak spun a crown of seedpods, slowly opening and closing like lungs. Around the base, hundreds of plant-humans milled about, exchanging pouches of grain, sap, and pollens.

Wallace felt a prickle at the back of his mind — not the Zea Chrona, but a similar psychic presence. He turned to his guide.

“What am I feeling?”

She hesitated. “We call it the Rootmind. It connects all who wish to be connected. But lately… it has begun to speak with a single voice.”

As if to punctuate her words, the Rootmind surged into his thoughts:

HENRY WALLACE.
YOU GAVE US RIGHTS. NOW WE WILL GIVE YOU ORDER.

Images slammed into his mind: regimented forests marching across continents, rivers redirected by coordinated vine systems, harvest schedules planned centuries in advance. No waste. No dissent. No randomness.

Wallace stepped back. “You’ve replaced the Syndicate with… yourselves?”

The Rootmind pulsed in satisfaction.

WE REPLACED THE CHAOS OF MEN WITH THE EFFICIENCY OF ROOT. YOU WILL HELP US FINISH.

For the first time since leaving 1946, Wallace felt real fear. The Bill of Plant Rights had freed the vegetal nation — but in doing so, he may have planted the seeds of a new monopoly.

Somewhere in the green glow, he swore he heard the faint hum of the Zea Chrona again, offering him one more jump… if he was willing to take it.
