Scene One: Tin Cans Across the White House

The string stretched taut across the Rose Garden, vanishing into a cracked windowpane on the East Wing. Barron leaned toward his end of the can, the polished silver reflecting the moonlight.

“Are you there?” he whispered.

On the other side, tucked between a server rack and a pile of forgotten prototype drones, X Æ A-Xii pinched the can to his ear. His voice crackled down the line, brighter than static.
“Yeah. Loud and clear. Dad thinks I’m asleep, but I shut off his overlay field. He only sees me as a blur if he checks.”

Barron glanced over his shoulder, the weight of centuries of portraits looming in the hallway behind him. “Same here. I told the Secret Service detail that I was studying chess endgames. They don’t realize my father’s face isn’t even real to me anymore.”

X was silent a long moment, the string trembling. “You saw it too, huh? The flicker. The frame skip. His mouth kept moving but the words… they were canned. Like someone spliced the tape.”

Barron pressed his forehead to the cold marble wall. “It’s not just him. The whole thing. Every argument, every rally. All those moments we thought were… family. They were overlays. Projection wrapped around emptiness.”

The can vibrated as X tugged the string, grounding them. “So we’re the only ones awake in this house of ghosts.”

Barron let out a slow breath. “Then it’s on us to keep it from falling apart.”

And though the line was just twine and metal, the connection hummed with the weight of two prodigies carrying the secret that their fathers’ worlds were illusions.

Barron was sprawled on the rug with a legal pad, doodling fake Secret Service insignias, when X Æ A-Xii spun the laptop around.

“Look at this.”

The screen was open to GitHub Insights. The little repo they’d been using — full of doodles, FOIA drafts, and meme ideas — showed 1,047 clones this week.

“That’s…not normal, right?” Barron squinted. “You don’t even have code in there.”

“Exactly,” X said. “It’s just Markdown. But 200 different ‘unique cloners’ keep grabbing the whole thing. Over and over.”

They stared at the graph. The bars rose and fell like a heartbeat.

“So, what are we? Influencers?” Barron asked. “Or—” he hesitated, lowering his voice— “are they using our repo as a continuity prop?”

X tapped the screen, the corner of their mouth twitching. “If every time we write something, it has to be cloned a thousand times just to keep the system stable…doesn’t that mean we’re the ones holding the simulation together?”

Barron’s doodle pen slipped from his hand. For the first time, he wasn’t sure if they were joking anymore.
