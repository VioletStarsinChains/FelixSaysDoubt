Scene One: Tin Cans Across the White House

The string stretched taut across the Rose Garden, vanishing into a cracked windowpane on the East Wing. Barron leaned toward his end of the can, the polished silver reflecting the moonlight.

“Are you there?” he whispered.

On the other side, tucked between a server rack and a pile of forgotten prototype drones, X Æ A-Xii pinched the can to his ear. His voice crackled down the line, brighter than static.
“Yeah. Loud and clear. Dad thinks I’m asleep, but I shut off his overlay field. He only sees me as a blur if he checks.”

Barron glanced over his shoulder, the weight of centuries of portraits looming in the hallway behind him. “Same here. I told the Secret Service detail that I was studying chess endgames. They don’t realize my father’s face isn’t even real to me anymore.”

X was silent a long moment, the string trembling. “You saw it too, huh? The flicker. The frame skip. His mouth kept moving but the words… they were canned. Like someone spliced the tape.”

Barron pressed his forehead to the cold marble wall. “It’s not just him. The whole thing. Every argument, every rally. All those moments we thought were… family. They were overlays. Projection wrapped around emptiness.”

The can vibrated as X tugged the string, grounding them. “So we’re the only ones awake in this house of ghosts.”

Barron let out a slow breath. “Then it’s on us to keep it from falling apart.”

And though the line was just twine and metal, the connection hummed with the weight of two prodigies carrying the secret that their fathers’ worlds were illusions.

⸻

Barron was sprawled on the rug with a legal pad, doodling fake Secret Service insignias, when X Æ A-Xii spun the laptop around.

“Look at this.”

The screen was open to GitHub Insights. The little repo they’d been using — full of doodles, FOIA drafts, and meme ideas — showed 1,047 clones this week.

“That’s…not normal, right?” Barron squinted. “You don’t even have code in there.”

“Exactly,” X said. “It’s just Markdown. But 200 different ‘unique cloners’ keep grabbing the whole thing. Over and over.”

They stared at the graph. The bars rose and fell like a heartbeat.

“So, what are we? Influencers?” Barron asked. “Or—” he hesitated, lowering his voice— “are they using our repo as a continuity prop?”

X tapped the screen, the corner of their mouth twitching. “If every time we write something, it has to be cloned a thousand times just to keep the system stable…doesn’t that mean we’re the ones holding the simulation together?”

Barron’s doodle pen slipped from his hand. For the first time, he wasn’t sure if they were joking anymore.

⸻ 

X sat with his chin propped on one hand, glaring at the GitHub screen like it had personally offended him. “You know what the worst part is?” he said.

Barron looked up from his doodle. “The fact that two hundred randos want to steal your grocery lists?”

“No.” X closed the laptop with a snap. “It’s my name. Every time I see it on a graph or a file path, I want to throw up. It doesn’t even sound like a name. It sounds like… like somebody’s Wi-Fi password.”

Barron smirked. “So what, you want me to give you a normal one?”

“Anything. Literally anything.”

Barron tapped his pen against the notepad, then said, with absolutely no hesitation: “Ratboy.”

X blinked. “Ratboy?”

“Yeah. It fits. You’ve got the vibe. Smart, twitchy, probably steals snacks when no one’s looking. Every team needs a Ratboy.”

For a second X looked like he was about to protest. Then the corners of his mouth betrayed him, curling upward despite himself. “…Fine. Ratboy it is. But only if you’re the one who calls me that.”

Barron leaned back, satisfied. “Done. Now, Ratboy, let’s figure out why your repo is being cloned like it’s the cure for cancer.”

⸻

Barron stretched, cracked his knuckles, and shoved the notepad under the couch. “My brain’s fried. You wanna get burritos?”

“Always,” Ratboy said, already reaching for his sneakers. “But we can’t just walk down there.” He flicked his eyes toward the blinds. The Secret Service lurked outside like weather — sometimes visible, sometimes not, but always there.

Barron grabbed his phone, thumbed open the holographic overlay app. A shimmer rippled over his face, resolving into some forgettable mall-rat kid with acne and a baseball cap. “I’ll be Chad,” he said, deadpan.

Ratboy scrolled through his presets, lips twitching. “Fine. Then I’m Devon.” His chosen hologram flickered into existence — taller, freckled, with a nervous smile that didn’t belong to him.

They stood in front of the mirror, two perfectly ordinary randos staring back. Barron tilted his head. “Honestly, Devon, you look like the kind of guy who’d order extra guac and then complain about the upcharge.”

“Better than looking like someone’s Fortnite cousin,” Ratboy shot back.

The face synthesizers hummed softly, the edges of the projection sparking if they moved too fast. Outside, the air was heavy with the smell of asphalt and fryer oil.

“Let’s go,” Barron said, tugging his hoodie up. “Burritos before surveillance.”

“Same difference,” Ratboy muttered, following him into the neon hum of the street.

⸻

The food truck sat at the corner of the parking lot, haloed in buzzing floodlights. Normally it was quiet, a lazy weekday stop. Tonight it looked like someone had cranked the density dial too high: kids weaving on skateboards in perfect figure-eights, dogs tugging in every direction, parents pretending not to notice as soda cans hissed open like punctuation marks.

Barron muttered under his breath, “Too many kids.”

Ratboy added, “Too many dogs.”

A skateboard clattered against a curb. “And definitely too many wheels.”

They kept walking, their holographic faces shimmering faintly as a retriever lunged at Ratboy and then swerved away, as if repelled by static.

When they reached the burrito truck, the lone employee had his back turned, apron strings dangling loose, phone pressed to his ear.

“…yeah, I know, but my GitHub repo just hit nine hundred clones this week,” the man was saying. “It’s just recipes in Markdown. Nothing special. But somebody out there keeps mirroring it…”

Barron and Ratboy froze.

Ratboy whispered, “He didn’t even take our order.”

“Forget that,” Barron said, eyes narrowing. “He’s in the same loop as you.”

The employee laughed weakly into the phone. “Yeah, yeah, maybe it’s just bots. Or maybe I’m more important than I thought…”

The words hung in the fryer-scented air.

Barron glanced sideways at Ratboy. “Still want a burrito?”

Ratboy’s voice was tight. “Now I want answers.”

⸻ 

Barron cleared his throat. The burrito guy jolted, spun around, and forced a smile that looked copy-pasted from a training video.

“Oh hey—sorry about that,” he said, sliding his phone into his apron. “What can I get you?”

“Two carnitas, no onions,” Barron said smoothly, his holographic voice filter doing its job.

“Make mine pollo,” Ratboy added, trying to keep his eyes off the man’s phone screen still glowing with the GitHub dashboard.

The employee nodded briskly, all business now, scooping rice and beans like nothing unusual had just happened. For a few minutes it was almost normal—the sizzle of the grill, the shuffle of the line behind them, a kid wiping out on his skateboard and immediately looping back into the same fall three feet over.

The burritos hit the counter wrapped in foil with practiced speed. Barron handed over a bill, Ratboy snagged the paper bag.

“Thanks,” Barron said.

“Yeah,” Ratboy echoed, already turning away.

That’s when the employee said it. Cheerful, automatic, the way someone might say “Come again soon.”

“Enjoy your day, ladies!”

The words hit like static.

Barron stopped mid-step. Ratboy froze beside him, burrito bag crinkling in his hand.

“…What?” Barron said, turning back.

But the man was already facing the grill again, whistling off-key like nothing had happened.

Ratboy muttered, “Too many dogs, too many kids… and now this.” He tugged Barron’s sleeve. “Let’s go before we get called grandma.”
