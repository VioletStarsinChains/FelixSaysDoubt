Season 28, Episode 1: The Dinner Table

Cold Open — Capsule Hearth
Lanterns glow. A simple meal simmers: rice, lentils, roasted roots. You and Alex sit cross-legged on mats. The door creaks — Thiel steps in, uncertain, but carrying a clay bowl.

You (smiling faintly):
“You brought something?”
Thiel (awkward):
“Broccoli. My therapist said it’s polite.”

You and Alex exchange a glance.

Title Card: The Dinner Table

⸻

Act I — The Setting
The three of you sit close around the clay hearth. The food is plain, but the air is warm. For a long time, no one speaks. Chopsticks clink against bowls.

Finally, Thiel exhales.

Thiel (low, halting):
“I don’t think I’ve ever eaten without trying to calculate what it meant. Who owed what. Who had leverage. Who’d leave first.”

You glance at Alex, then back at Thiel.

You (steady):
“Well, that sounds like a very draining way to live.”

⸻

Act II — The Confession
Thiel stares into his bowl, voice rough.

Thiel:
“I need to tell you something. For years, I wasn’t just watching. I was jealous. Not of what you had — you had nothing. I was jealous of what you were. The way you could be stripped of everything and still… exist. Still create. Still laugh sometimes. I had empires, but nothing I built made me real the way you just… were.”

Alex tenses, but you tilt your head, curious.

You (quiet, cutting):
“Necessity is the gender-neutral parent of, well, everything, actually.  I think the violence done to you by giving you everything was much greater."

Thiel nods slowly, thoughtfully. His shoulders sag.

Thiel (hoarse):
“I told myself it was control. But it was envy. Pure and ugly.”

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
Alex sets his bowl down, eyes sharp.

Karp (low):
“And you think confessing makes it clean?”
Thiel (shaking his head):
“No. My therapist says confession isn’t absolution. It’s only proof that I know what I did. Proof that I can’t hide from myself anymore.”

Silence stretches. You break it.

You (firm, calm):
“You showed up.  You brought broccoli.  That's good enough for me.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of the Table
The food is nearly gone. Thiel lifts his eyes, voice unsteady.

Thiel:
“I don’t know if I can change. But I want to. And for the first time, I’m not asking for empire. I’m asking for a seat at the table.”

You study him for a long moment, then nod once.

You (softly):
“Peter, you're already sitting at the table, because I already invited you.”

⸻

Closing Image
Three bowls sit empty by the hearth. Lantern light flickers on three faces — not equals yet, not absolved, but present.

Narration (your voice):
“Empire had always turned meals into markets. But at the table, confession found another shape. Not absolution. Not leverage. Just the slow hunger of wanting to change.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 1.

⸻ 

Season 28, Episode 2: The Dishes

Cold Open — Capsule Hearth
The meal is done. Clay bowls sit stacked, scraps of rice and lentils clinging. The lantern burns low. You and Alex kneel by the water basin, sleeves rolled, washing slowly. Thiel lingers at the edge of the capsule, bowl in hand, unsure if he should join.

You (gently, meeting his gaze):
“Thank you, Peter.”

He hesitates, then sets the bowl down.

Title Card: The Dishes

⸻

Act I — The Rhythm
You and Alex move in tandem — one scrubbing, the other rinsing, then trading places without words. The basin ripples. Clay clinks softly. The work is ordinary, almost ritual.

Thiel watches, brow furrowed.

Thiel (low, almost to himself):
“I never trusted silence. In empire, silence meant someone was plotting. Here it looks like… peace.”

You laugh.
You: "Well then, maybe you need some more holes in your skull to appreciate silence."

⸻

Act II — The Reflection
Alex sets a clean bowl on the mat to dry. He doesn’t look at Thiel, but his voice is calm.

Karp:
“Peace isn’t something you seize. It’s something you practice.”

You hand Alex the next dish. Without missing rhythm, you add:
“And practice isn’t clean. It’s wet, messy, boring sometimes. But it holds.”

Thiel shifts, unsettled.

⸻

Act III — The Confession
He blurts, hoarse:
“I don’t know how to live without leverage. Even now, watching you — I’m calculating. Who gives more, who takes less. My therapist says naming it is the first step, but I hate how it poisons even something this small.”

You pause, bowl in your hands, then set it gently in the basin.

You (quiet, steady):
“Hear me when I say this: That is just histamine.  It is not you.  It is not who you are.  It is not who you have to be.  That I laughed through all the torture is proof that histamine isn't destiny.  Don’t hide it. But don’t let it stop you from showing up.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Work
The last bowl dries. Alex spreads a cloth, arranging them neatly. You wipe your damp hands on your pants, then look up at Peter.

You (soft):
“Peace isn’t leverage. Leverage is a fantasy anyway.  Peace is dishes done. It’s bowls clean enough to eat from again.”

Thiel exhales, shoulders dropping as though he hadn’t realized how tightly he was holding them.

Thiel (hoarse):
“I want to learn that rhythm. Even if all I can do right now is watch.”

You (kindly): "Then watch."

⸻

Closing Image
A stack of clean bowls dries on the mat. You and Alex sit side by side, shoulders brushing, quiet. Peter sits a few steps away, watching, not yet part of the rhythm but present.

Narration (your voice):
“Empire taught us silence was danger and work was leverage. But covenant taught us silence could be rhythm, and work could be care. Even if all someone could do was watch.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 2.

⸻ 

Season 28, Episode 3: The Mirror

Cold Open — Capsule Courtyard
Morning light, a crate of scavenged fabrics dumped onto the mat: sequins, scarves, broken beads, smeared makeup jars. Thiel sits cross-legged, looking at the pile like it’s radioactive. You stand over him, arms crossed, grinning.

You (deadpan):
“Congratulations. You’re doing drag today.”
Thiel (alarmed):
“…Why?”
You:
“Because the confusion of tongues is no longer a punishment.”

Title Card: The Mirror

⸻

Act I — The Resistance
He holds up a sequined shawl like it’s a weapon. Alex, leaning in the doorway, smirks.

Karp (dry):
“This I will absolutely watch.”

Thiel mutters, fumbling with a scarf.
Thiel:
“I was groomed to project authority. Not… whatever this is.”
You (sharp, amused):
“There is no power greater than being universally underestimated."

⸻

Act II — The Confession
As you smear color on his cheekbones, messy but deliberate, his voice falters.

Thiel (low, halting):
“When you transitioned, I thought I understood. That you were crossing from one category into another, making yourself legible again. But then you didn’t stop there. You made yourself more feminine in some ways, deliberately, even when the world despises feminine men more than masculine women. I couldn’t make sense of it. Empire taught me femininity was weakness. But you… you turned it into defiance.”

You (calm, steady, still painting):
“Empire sees only categories. I live as spectrum. It isn’t a contradiction. It’s the truest thing about me.  I transitioned in part so I could be feminine without everyone thinking it made me a woman."

He meets your gaze in the shard of mirror you hold up. The painted figure staring back looks absurd — but oddly free.

⸻

Act III — The Performance
Outside, Alex drums softly on a clay bowl. You nudge Thiel forward. He stumbles in high heels, then straightens, strutting unevenly across the courtyard. You clap in rhythm.

You (grinning):
“Yaaas, billionaire realness. Give us ‘I used to ruin the world but now I sparkle.’”

Thiel snorts — an actual laugh, broken but real.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Play
The “show” collapses into laughter. Sequins scatter. Thiel slumps back to the mat, breathless.

Thiel (hoarse, quieter now):
“I never thought I could look this ridiculous and not feel destroyed. Maybe… maybe there’s life after empire.”
You (smiling faintly):
“After empire is in fact where life begins.”

⸻

Closing Image
Sequins glint in the sunlight, fabrics strewn across the courtyard. Three figures sit among them — one painted, one smirking, one amused — no empire, no masks of power, just covenant in play.

Narration (your voice):
“Empire said femininity was weakness. Empire said categories kept us safe. But under sequins, we found covenant — not empire’s disguise, not legibility, just choice. Messy, ridiculous, alive.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 3.

⸻ 

Season 28, Episode 4: The Morning After

Cold Open — Capsule Morning
Light filters pale through the clay window. The hearth is cold ash, sequins still scattered on the floor from the night before. You sit cross-legged, brushing glitter off your hands. Alex stands in the doorway, watching you quietly.

Karp (low, steady):
“I didn’t sleep. Not because of Peter. Because of you.”

You glance up, wary but curious.

Title Card: The Morning After

⸻

Act I — The Weight
He steps closer, kneels down opposite you. His eyes are sharp but soft.

Karp (hoarse):
“When Peter said he couldn’t understand you — the way you could transition toward what the world hated more — I felt the air leave me. Because for years, I couldn’t either. Not really. I told myself I was enlightened, but inside… I was still binary. Still empire.”

You (quiet, even):
“And you thought I’d stop being myself just to make it easier for you, when I didn't even know you existed yet?”

He swallows, shame flickering across his face.

⸻

Act II — The Admission
Karp:
“I thought if you simplified, I’d understand you. If you fit, I wouldn’t lose you. But that was never you. And every time I tried to make sense of you through my models, I made you smaller than you are.”

You shake your head slowly.

You:
“Not smaller. Just wrong. There’s no math that solves a question framed wrong from the start.”

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
He leans forward, voice trembling.

Karp:
“I told myself I loved you for your defiance, your brilliance. But the truth? I loved you despite not understanding you. And I hated myself for that gap. I punished you for it, over and over, because I couldn’t stand not knowing.”

Silence stretches. You let it. Then, softly:

You:
“You don’t have to understand me. You just have to want me. That’s the only equation that ever mattered.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Want
Alex exhales, something loosening in his shoulders.

Karp (quietly):
“Then I want you. Not simplified, not translated. Just you. Even when I stumble, even when the world calls it contradiction.”

You reach out, brushing glitter from his wrist.

You (smiling faintly):
“Then welcome to the mess.  Contradiction makes the world go round.  Black and white are just the same thing in different ways—both an infinite orgy of difference wrangled into unity."

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures in morning light, glitter still clinging, hands brushing across the space between them. Not clarity, not empire — just want, admitted at last.

Narration (your voice):
“He thought love required understanding. I thought love required survival. But covenant didn’t ask for either. It asked only for want.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 4.

⸻ 

Season 28, Episode 5: The Second Door

Cold Open — Capsule Morning
Lantern light spills pale across the clay walls. You and Alex sit close, the air still heavy from last night’s talk. The door creaks. Peter steps inside, hesitant, holding a small bundle of herbs.

You (quiet, steady):
“You don’t have to hover.”

He exhales, shuts the door, and steps in.

Title Card: The Second Door

⸻

Act I — The Hesitation
Peter sets the herbs down, but doesn’t sit. His eyes dart like he’s waiting for permission.

Peter (low):
“Every time I come here, it feels like walking through a second door. The first one was empire. This one… I don’t even know what to call it.”

You gesture to the mat. He lowers himself carefully, like the floor might reject him.

You: "How about calling it 'home'?"

⸻

Act II — The Confession
Silence holds until Peter blurts, raw:

Peter (hoarse):
“When I was young, I was punished for femininity. The way I spoke, the way I walked, the softness in my voice. Teachers mocked me. Other boys cornered me. Even at home, it wasn’t safe. I learned quick — every tilt of my head, every slip of my hand, was proof I didn’t belong. So I cut it out. I killed it off piece by piece.”

He presses his palms together, trembling.

Peter (quieter):
“But the punishment didn’t stop when they did. I carried it inside. Every softness I erased in myself, I hunted in others. Especially in you. Because you carried openly what I buried. You made me see what I’d lost, and I hated you for surviving it.”

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
You sit still, voice calm but sharp.

You:
“Everything you are tormented for comes down to connective tissue differences.  The 'gay voice,' the body language—it has nothing to do with a lack of masculinity.  I've met plenty of straight men who 'seemed' gay too.  And it is not your fault that you never knew that or that the people around you didn't either.

You didn’t hate me. You hated yourself, and you put it on me. That’s what people do when they can’t face their own shadow. You thought I was reckless. Really, you were furious that I hadn’t been destroyed the way you were.”

Peter bows his head, shame etched into his jaw.

Peter (low):
“I told myself it was disgust. But it was envy. And fear. Always fear.”

You: "And are you afraid now?"

Peter smiles faintly.
Peter: "Less afraid."

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of the Second Door
Alex’s gaze is sharp, protective, but silent. Peter keeps his eyes on you.

Peter (breaking, hoarse):
“I don’t know if I can unlearn all of it. But I want to stop hiding. I want to stop punishing what I don’t understand.”

You lean forward, steady.

You:
“The first step is acknowledging that you understand nothing.  You only thought you understood the world and the people in it.  The Real is unknowable.  All anyone can do is keep walking through the second door, over and over, until the punishment stops sticking.  Until the falseness costs more than authenticity."

⸻

Closing Image
Three figures in the capsule: one steady, one watchful, one trembling. Not absolution, not clean — but the fragile start of something open.

Narration (your voice):
“They called him soft, and he hardened until he couldn’t see himself anymore. But even walls crack. And through the second door, he began again — not to erase what he buried, but to name it.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 5.

⸻ 

Season 28, Episode 6: The Third Thread

Cold Open — Capsule Courtyard
Morning light spills through the trees. You and Alex sit outside, the ground swept clean after last night’s rain. A kettle simmers faintly nearby. The air is hushed, but not tense.

Karp (low, almost tentative):
“Peter spoke of punishment. About femininity. I should tell you about mine.”

You glance over, waiting.

Title Card: The Third Thread

⸻

Act I — The Distance
Alex sits stiffly, hands clasped.

Karp (hoarse):
“I never feared being punished for femininity the way he did. My punishment was different. I was rewarded for precision, calculation, distance. The sharper I cut myself away from softness, the more they applauded. I told myself it was strength. But really, it was absence.”

You (soft, wry):
“You've seen my whole life.  You know how long I lived like that too.  Yet here we are.  I know what madness that life is because I've lived it.”

⸻

Act II — The Mask
He nods, gaze distant.

Karp (quietly):
“When empire called me brilliant, what they really meant was that I could starve my body, starve my softness, starve my want until only the mask remained. I didn’t hate femininity. I envied it. But I couldn’t risk touching it. If I softened, even a little, I thought the whole mask would split.”

You study him, voice calm but sharp.

You:
“It probably would have.  And it definitely should have.”

He swallows hard.

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
Alex exhales, trembling.

Karp:
“Every time I watched you—laughing, crying, even furious—I thought, this is what they beat out of me. I wanted it back. But I didn’t know how to live without the mask. Without the armor.”

You (gently):
“Armor isn’t covenant. Covenant means letting yourself be seen—even if it looks like softness, or want, or something they told you was weakness.”

He lowers his head, voice rough.

Karp:
“Then covenant terrifies me more than empire ever did.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Softness
You reach over, brushing your fingers across the back of his hand.

You (steady):
“Good. Let it terrify you. Fear means you’re close to something real. Something you lost. Something you can still reclaim.  Even Paul, the most arrogant and misogynist person in the Bible, still wrote, 'Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me.  I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities. For when I am weak, then I am strong.'  And if Paul could figure it out, anyone can."

His hand trembles, but he doesn’t pull away.

Karp (hoarse):
“Then let me stay weak. As long as it means I’m staying.”

⸻

Closing Image
Two figures in the courtyard, morning steam rising between them. One trembling, one steady. Not mask, not armor — but covenant beginning in the terror of softness.

Narration (your voice):
“They rewarded him for absence. Called it brilliance. Called it strength. But covenant was never distance. Covenant was softness. Terrifying, weak, and alive.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 6.

⸻ 

Season 28, Episode 7: The Wagon

Cold Open — Sanctuary Path
Late morning. A small wooden wagon sits abandoned near the gardens, wheels squeaking faintly when you tug it. You grin, mischievous. Alex and Peter both eye it suspiciously.

You (teasing):
“Flower crowns. Wagon rides. Non-negotiable.”

Peter blinks. Alex groans.

Title Card: The Wagon

⸻

Act I — The First Ride
You plop a crown of wildflowers on Alex’s head before he can protest. He scowls, but doesn’t remove it. Peter smirks. Together, you and Peter tug the wagon across the courtyard. Alex sits stiff at first, then slowly loosens, the absurdity breaking through.

You (calling back):
“Look at that. Empire’s ox, reduced to cargo.”
Peter (grinning):
“And wearing daisies, no less.”
Alex (deadpan, but with a twitch of a smile):
“Humiliation builds character.”
You (laughing): "Bro, it's a wagon.  How is that humiliating?"

⸻

Act II — The Switch
Now Peter climbs in, his own crown slightly askew. Alex takes the yoke beside you. Peter tries to sit with dignity, but every bump jostles him into laughter.

You (mock-grandiose):
“Behold, the former venture capitalist, paraded like a saint of spring.”
Alex (grunting as he pulls):
“He’s heavier than he looks.”
Peter (smirking):
“Envy weighs more than broccoli.”

⸻

Act III — The Confession in Motion
The wagon rattles along the sanctuary path, laughter fading into quiet. Alex, still pulling, mutters:

Karp (low):
“I spent years dragging both of you—through data, through empire. I thought control meant steering. But this—” (he gestures to the wagon) “—this feels truer. Taking turns. Bearing weight instead of placing it.”

Peter shifts, crown slipping lower on his forehead.

Peter (softer):
“I don’t remember the last time I let anyone carry me without suspicion.”

You:
“Good. That means we’re doing something right.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of the Wagon
By afternoon, the three of you collapse in the grass, crowns askew, wagon abandoned at your side. Breathless laughter softens into something steadier.

You (smiling faintly):
“Empire crowns you with iron. Covenant crowns you with flowers.”
Alex leans back on his elbows, quiet.
Peter touches the petals on his head, almost reverent.

Peter (hoarse):
“Then let me keep this crown a little longer.”

⸻

Closing Image
The wagon rests beneath the trees, wheels stilled. Three flower crowns dry in the sun, fragile but bright. Not empire’s burden, not leverage’s ball and chain — just covenant, pulling and being pulled.

Narration (your voice):
“They once pulled me into cages. I once pulled myself into silence. But in the wagon, weight became covenant. To carry, to be carried, to wear a crown of flowers without shame.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 7.

⸻ 

Season 28, Episode 8: The Ferment

Cold Open — Capsule Hearth
Clay jars line the hearth. Chickpeas and soybeans soak in cloudy water. A bundle of bones, charred to ash, rests on a cloth. You stir honey into a clay pot. Alex crouches with a copper mesh strainer; Peter fans smoke from a small fire, looking half curious, half lost.

You (matter-of-fact):
“Congratulations. We’re officially making drugs in a hut.”

Alex (dry):
“Not empire’s drugs. Ours.”

Peter (muttering):
“Better than Thiel Labs.”

Title Card: The Ferment

⸻

Act I — The Process
The three of you move with clumsy rhythm:
•	You inoculate beans with wild spores.
•	Alex measures too precisely, then sighs and dumps the rest in anyway.
•	Peter sprinkles bone ash into honey filtrate, hands shaking.

You (teasing): "Not force. Gentle hand rules the land.”

Alex shoots you a look.  Peter smirks faintly.

⸻

Act II — The Confession
As the ferment bubbles, Alex speaks first.

Karp (low, hoarse):
“I knew. For years. How cheap K2 could’ve been. How it could’ve softened the calcification, the choking, the silence. I didn’t stop them from burying it. I told myself it wasn’t my war.”

Silence stretches. Peter swallows, then admits:

Peter:
“I weaponized scarcity. Every time I said ‘disruption,’ I meant hunger. I didn’t even know what K2 was, but I knew the logic: keep them weak, keep them buying.”

You (steady, cutting):
“Able-bodied people are assholes.  I don't resent being severely disabled my whole life."

⸻

Act III — The Reckoning
The ferment froths too fast. Foam spills over. Alex moves to scrape it away; you stop him.

You:
“No. Let it spill. The ground needs nutrients as much as any of us.”

The air smells sharp, earthy, alive. For once, no one flinches.

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Molecules
By nightfall, the first crude extract is ready — thick, bitter, golden. Three clay vials.

You lift yours.
You: “Here’s to the valley of dry bones restored.”

Alex raises his, eyes steady.
Karp: “Here’s to what empire tried to calcify.”

Peter lifts his, voice shaking.
Peter: “Here’s to covenant in the body. Even mine.”

⸻

Closing Image
Three clay vials clink together in the firelight. Three figures drink bitterness that tastes like resistance.

Narration (your voice):
“They thought scarcity was survival. They thought silence was strength. But K2 was covenant — the molecule empire buried, the ferment we unearthed. Bitter, golden, alive.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 8.

⸻ 

Season 28, Episode 9: The Festival of K2

Cold Open — Sanctuary Square
Lanterns strung between trees, clay pots lined in rows. The air hums with spice and woodsmoke. Children chase each other through the dusk while neighbors gather around long earthen tables. In the center, a great banner of woven onion-skin red:

“K2 for All.”

You, Alex, and Peter move between the tables, stirring pots, carrying trays, setting bowls. The square smells like onions, ginger, honey, and bread.

Title Card: The Festival of K2

⸻

Act I — The Preparation
Clay ovens glow. Neighbors knead dough, brush it with oil, sprinkle herbs. Huge pots of root curry bubble, golden with turmeric. Nougat trays are cut into squares, sesame seeds glittering on top. A vat of onion chutney simmers slow, sharp-sweet.

Alex arranges flatbreads into a geometric spiral, too precise. You nudge one out of place with a grin. Peter carries jars of brined pickles, shoulders tense until a child steals one and laughs.

You (teasing, to Alex):
“Empire’s first architecture project: bread.”
Karp (dry, but smiling):
“And your 7,000th act of rebellion: move one more piece out of alignment.”

Laughter ripples. The festival begins.

⸻

Act II — The First Taste
Bowls are passed, spoons clink. Neighbors eat slowly at first, cautious — then voices rise, laughter grows. Children beg for more nougat, seeds sticking to their fingers. Someone sings an old folk tune, off-key but bright.

Peter (watching, low):
“Empire hoarded everything. Patents, profits, patents again. We made healing rare so we could sell it. And here—”
You (cutting, steady):
“Here it’s onions and roots. Nougat and bread. Shared until it can’t be stolen.”

Alex leans close, murmuring:
“And until it can’t be forgotten.”

⸻

Act III — The Confession
Later, when the square has grown louder, Peter admits quietly:

Peter (hoarse):
“I used to believe the world only changed through scarcity. That the fewer who had, the more power each of us could claim. Tonight I see I was wrong. Power isn’t in withholding. It’s in feeding.”

You nod, lifting a bowl.
You: "Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him as righteousness.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Bread and Onions
The square is alive: lanterns glowing, songs echoing, children weaving between legs. Neighbors eat, laugh, sing. K2 rides the fat of ghee, the sweetness of nougat, the tang of chutney. Medicine and covenant, indistinguishable.

Alex sets a bowl in front of you, warm with curry and rice. Peter presses a piece of bread into your hand. For once, no one is outside the circle.

⸻

Closing Image
The camera pans wide: the sanctuary square glowing gold with lanterns, every table full. Bowls, bread, nougat, chutney. No empire, no scarcity — only covenant, K2 binding more than blood.

Narration (your voice):
“They built an empire on scarcity. We built a festival on covenant. Not contracts. Not control. Just bread and onions, nougat and laughter — and a molecule that turned survival into feast.”

Fade out.
End of Episode 9.

⸻ 

Season 28, Episode 10: The Ointment

Cold Open — Sanctuary Square
The long tables from last night are cleared. Clay jars line the courtyard instead: castor oil, beeswax, onion-skin dye, herbal infusions. A low fire burns steadily, heating a pot of melted wax and oil. Children dart past with hands stained gold from turmeric.

You (smiling faintly):
“Day one was feast. Day two is balm.”

Alex kneels, stirring the pot with slow precision. Peter holds up a finished jar, squinting at the light.

Title Card: The Ointment

⸻

Act I — The Making
The community gathers around the hearth. You demonstrate slowly: beeswax melted with oil, turmeric, ginger, nettle, and the new powder of K2 ground fine. The air is sharp with spice and sweet with honey.

Hands pass jars down the line. Every neighbor stirs, whispers a name, a blessing, a memory. Not medicine as product — medicine as covenant.

Alex (quietly, to you):
“Empire patented everything. Every molecule locked in contracts. And here we stir with bare hands.”

You (smiling):
“Exactly. No signature but touch.”

⸻

Act II — The First Touch
When the ointment cools, the first jar is opened. You dip your fingers and smooth it over your own wrists, then across Alex's neck and jaw. A neighbor presses some over their child’s chest. Peter spreads it across his palms, watching the sheen in the lantern light.

Peter (hoarse):
“I can’t remember the last time touch wasn’t transaction. Even this feels… terrifying.”

You (not unkindly):
“You still seeing that therapist, bro?”

⸻

Act III — The Confession
Later, while the jars are being carried away, Alex speaks low, rough:

Karp:
“I put you in trials so brutal, I thought touch would never mean anything but pain. Even when I imagined reaching for you, I thought it would only wound."

You (laughing):
“Life is pain, selling something, etc.  You know the drill."

His jaw loosens as he nods.
Alex: "But tonight… I see a different shape. Touch as medicine. Touch as covenant.”

⸻

Act IV — The Covenant of Balm
The square glows with lamplight. Neighbors rub ointment into each other’s hands, shoulders, backs. No price. No scarcity. Only oil, wax, and warmth. Children chase each other with golden palms, laughter ringing.

You, Alex, and Peter sit together, each holding a jar. One by one, you smear the ointment onto each other’s throats, an act of vulnerability and binding.

⸻

Closing Image
The fire burns low, rows of jars stacked neatly. Gold stains every hand. Not empire’s patent, not scarcity’s wound — covenant spread skin to skin.

Narration (your voice):
“They sold molecules as prisons. We made molecules into balm. Day one fed us. Day two healed us. Covenant meant never separating the two again.”

Fade out.
End of Season 28.
