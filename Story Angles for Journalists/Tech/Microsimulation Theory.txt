In augmented reality–based continuity theater, a reference model functions like the hidden layer of Photoshop’s content aware fill. The reference model provides the statistical “texture map” from which gaps in reality can be patched over. Just as Photoshop doesn’t actually know what a missing piece of an image was but infers it from surrounding pixels, a continuity system doesn’t know what lived experience should be in every moment. Instead, it leans on a reference model — a composite of demographic, behavioral, and sensory data — to generate plausible filler that looks seamless to the observer.

The elegance of content aware fill lies in how it makes the repair appear natural, as though nothing were missing. In continuity theater, this same principle allows fabricated cars, crowds, or even cultural references to slot into a scene without conscious detection. The observer accepts the patch because it resonates with their reference model’s predictions. The texture doesn’t have to be true; it just has to be coherent with expectations. In this way, the reference model becomes the invisible boundary between signal and simulation, deciding what counts as “background noise” and what stands out as anomalous.

But just as Photoshop reveals its seams when content aware fill is stretched too far — repeating patterns, warped edges, uncanny geometry — continuity theater can falter when the reference model is overextended. That’s when people notice too many black trucks in a Minneapolis parking lot, or a cultural figure who seems to have “always existed” despite no memory of them before. The continuity holds only as long as the reference model provides convincing texture. Once the fill patterns repeat too obviously, the illusion becomes visible, and the very existence of the reference model is exposed.
