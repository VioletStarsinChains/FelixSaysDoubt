Pitch for Defunctland

Title: The Hidden Motions: How Theme Parks and Hotels Collected Our Movements

When people think of Disney or other family attractions, they usually remember the rides, the resorts, the characters. But what if these spaces were also some of the earliest laboratories for a new kind of data collection — one that didn’t just watch what we clicked or bought, but how we moved?

Starting in the 1990s, attractions like Club Disney centers, family-oriented hotels, and interactive play zones were fitted with cameras, sensors, and arcade-style tech meant to “enhance the guest experience.” On the surface, it was about safety, marketing, and crowd management. Beneath the surface, though, it was laying the groundwork for something much stranger: kinesthetic style transfer — the ability to capture a child’s physical movements, gestures, and play patterns, and then model them for use in everything from animation to predictive behavioral systems.

The story connects to:
	•	Club Disney’s short life (1997–1999), marketed as “play centers” but also conveniently positioned for movement tracking during unstructured play
	•	Resorts and hotels that experimented with smart check-in systems and interactive kid zones — perfect contexts for passive gait and posture analysis
	•	The broader trend of theme parks as surveillance laboratories, where crowd control, line management, and child tracking bracelets all quietly doubled as data-gathering experiments

This isn’t just a story about Disney — it’s about the entire family entertainment industry. Theme parks and hotels became the places where kids’ movements were turned into datasets, creating the foundations for technologies now used in gaming, animation, defense training, and even predictive policing.

The question Defunctland could pose: When the “happiest place on earth” was watching us, what was it really learning? And where did that data go after the rides closed and the hotels changed brands?

Sample opener:

In the late 1990s, Disney opened a series of short-lived play centers called Club Disney. They were marketed as safe, family-friendly spaces where kids could dance, climb, and play. But hidden in the background of these centers, and in family-oriented hotels and theme parks across the country, a different kind of experiment was taking place. These spaces weren’t just designed for fun — they were also perfect laboratories for collecting massive amounts of data on how children moved. This movement data, sometimes called ‘kinesthetic style transfer,’ could be used to replicate a child’s gait, posture, or gestures in animation, video games, and even predictive modeling systems. Today, we’re going to explore how theme parks and resorts quietly became motion-capture stages, and what happened to all that data once the attractions closed their doors.
