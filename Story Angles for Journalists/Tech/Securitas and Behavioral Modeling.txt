Most people think of Securitas as rent-a-cops in uniforms, but their real value isn‚Äôt in deterring shoplifters ‚Äî it‚Äôs in the behavioral data they quietly harvest. Through contracts with DHS, DOJ, and GSA, Securitas‚Äô guards and monitoring centers sit at the chokepoints of federal buildings, airports, and data centers. Every badge swipe, every ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù glance logged, every pattern flagged by their AI-driven video systems becomes part of a behavioral dataset. That same data can be ‚Äî and in some cases already is ‚Äî funneled into predictive analytics platforms like Palantir. The question isn‚Äôt just whether Securitas is keeping people safe; it‚Äôs whether their guard logs and surveillance feeds are doubling as raw material for behavioral futures markets.
