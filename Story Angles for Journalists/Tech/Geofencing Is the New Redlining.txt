“They don’t just decide if you get a loan anymore. They decide if you ever see the apartment.”

Narrative Frame

In the old days, redlining meant you couldn’t get a mortgage if you lived on the wrong side of a map.
Now, the line is invisible. Rental platforms and property managers use microgeofencing — phone GPS, IP address, or ad-targeting data — to decide which listings appear in your search results. If you’re outside a certain fence, the apartment might as well not exist.

That means entire groups of people can be excluded before they even know there was an opportunity. It also means platforms (or their data brokers) can shape who ends up living with whom — curating “random” roommate pairings, building or breaking communities, and steering neighborhood demographics with algorithmic precision.

What used to be a banker with a red pen is now an app with a geo-filter. It looks neutral, but it’s the same outcome: discriminatory housing access — only quieter, faster, and harder to prove.
