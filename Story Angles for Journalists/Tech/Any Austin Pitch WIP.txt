Draft Explainer (for Any Austin)

So here’s the twist: all these systems we think of as boring—OSHA safety reports, FEMA preparedness programs, public health surveillance—aren’t just bureaucratic box-checking. They’re also being quietly folded into combat attrition simulations and behavioral futures models.

That means every civilian injury, disaster response, or workplace death isn’t just treated as a tragedy to prevent. It’s treated as training data. The warehouse worker who collapses from heat stroke, the family who can’t evacuate during a flood, the person who slips through the cracks in the health system—they all get modeled into algorithms that predict who survives and who doesn’t under stress.

And here’s where it gets uncanny: those predictions don’t just live in Pentagon war rooms. They bleed into markets that speculate on human collapse. What looks like a logistics spreadsheet or an emergency drill doubles as a kind of actuarial horror story, where your pain is both a test case and a tradable signal.

So when we talk about “dual-use” research, it’s not just “this tech could be used for good or bad.” It’s more like: the very same infrastructure that promises to keep us safe is already doubling as a simulation space where we’re the NPCs.
