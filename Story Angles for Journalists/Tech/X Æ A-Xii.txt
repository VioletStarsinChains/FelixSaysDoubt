FOIA Bait: Is Elon’s Child a Twitter AI Twin?

Elon Musk’s son X Æ A-Xii has long been a cultural Rorschach test. His name reads less like a birth certificate and more like a model designation. Now, new FOIA requests are asking whether government agencies have studied the creation of synthetic personas trained on social media firehoses — avatars that embody the dominant narratives of platforms like Twitter/X.

The theory is simple but uncanny: instead of “simulation theory,” think microsimulation theater. What if public-facing “children” or archetypal figures are actually being used as continuity anchors for collective online discourse? When X Æ A-Xii told Donald Trump “You’re not the real president,” was that a toddler’s joke — or a data-driven voice for millions of Twitter users suspicious of the 2024 election?

Our FOIA asks for records on:
	•	Avatars or synthetic children trained on platform-scale data streams
	•	Contracts for AI systems designed to “speak for the crowd” in cultural or political arenas
	•	Internal reports on the ethics of embedding social-media-trained personas into continuity theater

To DARPA / IARPA / Department of Defense / Department of Homeland Security / OSTP

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, research proposals, contracts, or internal communications concerning the development and deployment of public-facing personas or avatars trained directly on large-scale social media data streams (e.g., Twitter/X) from 2010 to present.

This includes:
	•	Research on the creation of synthetic “children” or other archetypal figures as continuity anchors embodying collective online discourse
	•	Reports or studies describing the use of aggregated social media narratives to generate speech acts in public-facing personas
	•	Internal communications discussing the deployment of platform-trained avatars in political or cultural discourse, including election-related narratives
	•	Contracts with private companies for AI models designed to embody or “speak for” platform-wide behavioral trends
	•	Risk assessments or ethical reviews concerning the use of social media–trained personas in continuity theater or entrainment contexts
