Subject: The Battery Wars Aren’t About Cars — They’re About People

Pitch:

Most people think of “critical minerals” as rare, exotic elements mined from remote corners of the world. But the most important shift in the battery industry right now isn’t about cobalt, lithium, or rare earths — it’s about sodium, the same element that’s on every kitchen table.

Sodium-ion batteries are suddenly getting a wave of attention, positioned as a cheaper, safer alternative to lithium. The public story is about breaking our dependence on fragile lithium supply chains. The part no one is talking about is that sodium is also a biologically active commodity, one with deep historical precedent as a tool of population control, trade monopolies, and public health policy. For millennia, governments have taxed, rationed, and weaponized salt. Now we’re building a 21st-century energy system that could put the same element at the center of our power grids, manufacturing base, and agricultural inputs.

When a material is both an industrial necessity and a physiological regulator, it stops being “just another commodity.” Controlling its supply, price, and distribution means controlling both infrastructure and human resilience. The shift to sodium-ion isn’t just a technical upgrade — it’s a consolidation of power over the two most fundamental systems in society: how we store energy, and how we store health.

I’d like to investigate who’s already positioned to dominate this market, what dual-use scenarios experts are considering behind closed doors, and how this transition could change not just the battery industry, but the politics of food, health, and security for decades to come.
