Subject: Rural America’s Unseen Endocrine Experiment

For decades, one of the most widely used herbicides in the U.S. — atrazine — has been turning up in drinking water across rural America. The EPA has known for years that atrazine is an endocrine disruptor in animals, capable of altering hormone balance, reproductive development, and even behavior at extremely low concentrations.

Yet despite mounting evidence, much of the public health conversation stops short of connecting the dots between agricultural chemical policy and chronic low-dose exposure in human populations — especially in farming communities, small towns, and marginalized rural areas.

The question is no longer whether atrazine disrupts hormones — it’s what that disruption means for the generations growing up with it in their water, their food, and their environment.

A targeted FOIA could pull together decades of agency records on:
	•	Low-dose, long-term effects on reproductive, neurological, and immune health
	•	Population-specific impacts, including environmental justice concerns
	•	Intergenerational consequences from prenatal and early-life exposure
	•	Synergistic effects with other pesticides and industrial pollutants in rural drinking water

The result could be a rare, comprehensive picture of a chemical that sits at the intersection of agriculture, public health, and environmental justice — and a wake-up call that “regulatory safe levels” may not be safe at all.

Request:

Requesting any and all reports, toxicological assessments, epidemiological studies, meeting minutes, internal communications, and contractor deliverables from 1990 to present regarding human health impacts of atrazine exposure, with particular attention to:
	•	Endocrine disruption and hormonal imbalance in adults or children, including low-dose and chronic exposure effects
	•	Reproductive and developmental impacts, such as changes in fertility, pregnancy outcomes, and congenital abnormalities
	•	Neurological and neurobehavioral outcomes, including mood regulation, attention, and cognitive function
	•	Immunological effects, including altered immune response and increased susceptibility to infectious or autoimmune disease
	•	Carcinogenic potential associated with both acute and cumulative exposure levels
	•	Presence and persistence of atrazine in public and private drinking water systems, including regional and seasonal variation in concentrations
	•	Synergistic or combined effects of atrazine with other agricultural chemicals, fertilizers, or industrial contaminants
	•	Population-specific vulnerability, including disproportionate exposure or health effects in rural agricultural communities, economically disadvantaged populations, and historically marginalized groups
	•	Intergenerational effects from prenatal or early-life exposure, including epigenetic changes and developmental programming outcomes
