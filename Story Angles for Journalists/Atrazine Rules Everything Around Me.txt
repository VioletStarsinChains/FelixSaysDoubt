Subject: Rural America’s Unseen Endocrine Experiment

For decades, one of the most widely used herbicides in the U.S. — atrazine — has been turning up in drinking water across rural America. The EPA has known for years that atrazine is an endocrine disruptor in animals, capable of altering hormone balance, reproductive development, and even behavior at extremely low concentrations.

Yet despite mounting evidence, much of the public health conversation stops short of connecting the dots between agricultural chemical policy and chronic low-dose exposure in human populations — especially in farming communities, small towns, and marginalized rural areas.

The question is no longer whether atrazine disrupts hormones — it’s what that disruption means for the generations growing up with it in their water, their food, and their environment.

A targeted FOIA could pull together decades of agency records on:
	•	Low-dose, long-term effects on reproductive, neurological, and immune health
	•	Population-specific impacts, including environmental justice concerns
	•	Intergenerational consequences from prenatal and early-life exposure
	•	Synergistic effects with other pesticides and industrial pollutants in rural drinking water

The result could be a rare, comprehensive picture of a chemical that sits at the intersection of agriculture, public health, and environmental justice — and a wake-up call that “regulatory safe levels” may not be safe at all.
