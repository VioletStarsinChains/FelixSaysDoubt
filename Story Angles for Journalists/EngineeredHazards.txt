Subject: FOIA Request – Engineered Geological Instabilities & Perception Manipulation in Behavioral Operations

Intro for Context (Press / Public Interest Statement):

Across the past four decades, incidents of sudden geological collapse — from sinkholes and mine cave-ins to ice shelf breaks — have claimed lives and reshaped entire communities. While most are treated as tragic accidents, there is growing evidence that in some cases these hazards have been deliberately engineered or exploited as tools of crowd control, population displacement, or political intimidation.

Even more alarming are reports that emerging perception-manipulation technologies — including augmented reality overlays and synthetic hallucinations — can be used to create the illusion of safe passage across lethal drop-offs or voids, similar to the sensory triggers suspected in the Overtoun Bridge dog deaths. This convergence of physical hazard creation with perceptual engineering raises urgent questions about public safety, consent, and the weaponization of environmental risk.

This FOIA request seeks records that could clarify whether U.S. agencies have studied, tested, or coordinated such methods, and whether safeguards exist to prevent their misuse against civilians.

To: DHS / FEMA / USGS / Army Corps of Engineers

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, internal communications, research proposals, training materials, or incident reports regarding the creation, simulation, or exploitation of geological or structural instabilities as part of behavioral influence, crowd control, or political operations, from 1980 to present.

This includes:
	•	Engineering or inducement of sinkholes, subsidence, landslides, ice shelf collapses, or similar events in populated or high-traffic areas.
	•	Use of flooding, mine collapse, tunnel breach, or other structural failures to redirect civilian movement or impede access to locations.
	•	Application of perceptual manipulation technologies (e.g., synthetic hallucinations, AR overlays, false affordances) to conceal hazards or create the illusion of safe passage in hazardous zones.
	•	Integration of geological hazard creation with psychological operations (PSYOP) or crowd dispersal tactics.
	•	Risk assessments on public safety related to deliberate or simulated environmental accidents.
	•	Contracts, grants, or partnerships with private or academic entities researching environmental hazards as a control mechanism.

Keywords: engineered collapse, sinkhole inducement, subsidence operations, ice shelf destabilization, false affordance, synthetic hallucination, environmental PSYOP, hazard perception manipulation, behavioral control, infrastructure sabotage, controlled demolition, void creation.
