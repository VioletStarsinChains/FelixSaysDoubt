Journalist Brief: “Are police overdosing on fentanyl — or on training scripts?”

What we know:
	•	Police collapse videos are widespread, yet toxicologists say brief skin contact with fentanyl powder cannot cause an overdose.
	•	Symptoms often look more like panic attacks, hyperventilation, or dissociation than opioid poisoning.

What this FOIA asks:
	•	Did DOJ, DEA, NIJ, or FLETC fund or distribute training programs that use entrainment, stress inoculation, or nocebo conditioning to simulate fentanyl exposure?
	•	Are officers experiencing scripted panic responses in the field, not pharmacological overdoses?
	•	Were psychoacoustic or perceptual overlays (infrasound, AR/VR, etc.) ever tested as part of opioid training drills?

Why it matters:
	•	If collapses are conditioned responses, not drug toxicity, then:
	•	Officers are being used as test subjects without informed consent.
	•	The public is being misled about the risks of fentanyl exposure.
	•	These incidents may be feeding behavioral futures markets that trade on fear of opioids and calls for expanded enforcement.

FOIA Keywords: fentanyl training, law enforcement entrainment, stress inoculation, nocebo response, psychoacoustic methods, DEA training, NIJ research.
