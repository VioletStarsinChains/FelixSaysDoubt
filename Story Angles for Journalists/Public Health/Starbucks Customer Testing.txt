Journalist Brief – Starbucks Blonde Roast Anomalies

On multiple occasions, I ordered Starbucks Veranda (Blonde Roast) at two different stores. The Starbucks app told me Blonde Roast was “not available” at one location — but when I walked inside, baristas served it to me without question.

Even stranger, the receipts don’t match: one store’s receipts list every detail of the order (e.g., Veranda Blend, White Mocha sauce add-ons), while the other prints only a vague line that says “Starbucks product.”

This means customers are being told one thing in the app, sold another thing in-store, and given receipts that sometimes erase what they actually ordered. That’s a big red flag for accountability and transparency.
