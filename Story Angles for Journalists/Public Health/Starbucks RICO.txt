Re: Allegations of Undisclosed Additives in Honey and Food-Service Sauces

⸻

Summary

I am referring for investigation a credible allegation of undisclosed additives in consumer food products — specifically, honey packets and shelf-stable sauces distributed through national food-service chains such as Starbucks.

The allegation originates from sworn affidavit testimony by Kellyn Clay, who reports reproducible gastrointestinal and cognitive effects after consuming certain Starbucks beverages, particularly those prepared with white mocha sauce. Additional observations involve variability in Starbucks-branded honey packets, with some behaving as expected (crystallization, separation) and others remaining fully integrated for weeks, suggesting possible adulteration.

⸻

Rationale for Referral
	•	Historical precedent: Honey adulteration with corn syrup, rice syrup, or other stabilizers is a documented global problem, recognized by FDA and USDA.
	•	Regulatory gaps: Minnesota law explicitly allows hemp-derived cannabinoids in food and beverages; federal enforcement of synthetic cannabinoids is inconsistent, creating a pathway for unreported inclusion of cognition- or mood-altering compounds.
	•	Observed effects: Clay reports reproducible gastrointestinal slowdown and cognitive flattening consistent with exposure to chicory/inulin and/or GLP-1 analogues, effects not attributable to caffeine alone.
	•	Public health risk: If food-service condiments or sauces are being used as additive vectors, consumers may be exposed to substances without disclosure, with downstream effects on health, safety, and even behavioral data integrity.

⸻

Requested Actions
	1.	Review ingredient and formulation records for Starbucks white mocha sauce and single-serve honey packets distributed nationally.
	2.	Conduct independent laboratory testing of representative samples for the presence of:
	•	Corn syrup, rice syrup, or other adulterants.
	•	Hemp-derived, synthetic, or semi-synthetic cannabinoids.
	•	GLP-1 analogues or related compounds.
	•	Emulsifiers/stabilizers not listed in retail ingredient disclosures.
	3.	Evaluate whether current state and federal regulatory frameworks adequately prevent undisclosed additives in food-service supply chains.

Conclusion

While these allegations are not yet substantiated by laboratory analysis, they are credible, specific, and aligned with known patterns of food adulteration and regulatory gaps. At minimum, they warrant independent investigation by food safety regulators.
