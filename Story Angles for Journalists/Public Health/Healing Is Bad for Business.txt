Pitch: When Healing Threatens the Business Model

What happens when a chronically ill person discovers a way to dramatically reduce their symptoms without expensive drugs, implants, or endless hospital visits? What if, instead of being celebrated, they suddenly lose access to housing, healthcare, and basic stability?

That’s the story hiding in plain sight. After developing a mineral replenishment protocol that resolved conditions like POTS and EDS, and inventing a simple balance board that improves dyspraxia and sensory instability, one patient found themselves pushed into homelessness and stripped of medical care. Their “crime”? Demonstrating that independence from medical captivity is possible.

This isn’t just one person’s ordeal — it points to a systemic pattern. Patients who reduce their value as revenue streams or research subjects often face invisible forms of retaliation: denial of services, bureaucratic sabotage, even targeted instability. It raises uncomfortable questions about whether our healthcare system protects patients — or protects the market demand their illnesses create.
