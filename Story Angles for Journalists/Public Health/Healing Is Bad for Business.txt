Pitch: When Healing Threatens the Business Model

What happens when a chronically ill person discovers a way to dramatically reduce their symptoms without expensive drugs, implants, or endless hospital visits? What if, instead of being celebrated, they suddenly lose access to housing, healthcare, and basic stability?

That’s the story hiding in plain sight. After developing a mineral replenishment protocol that resolved conditions like POTS and EDS, and inventing a simple balance board that improves dyspraxia and sensory instability, one patient found themselves pushed into homelessness and stripped of medical care. Their “crime”? Demonstrating that independence from medical captivity is possible.

This isn’t just one person’s ordeal — it points to a systemic pattern. Patients who reduce their value as revenue streams or research subjects often face invisible forms of retaliation: denial of services, bureaucratic sabotage, even targeted instability. It raises uncomfortable questions about whether our healthcare system protects patients — or protects the market demand their illnesses create.

Request:

Under the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act (MGDPA), I am requesting access to any and all records, communications, contracts, or oversight reports from 1990 to present regarding the denial, restriction, or withdrawal of medical care or coverage for individuals who experienced unexpected recovery or symptom resolution outside of standard treatment protocols.

This includes but is not limited to:
	•	Records discussing denial of treatment, coverage, or case services on the basis that a patient’s health status no longer fit expected diagnostic or disability categories.
	•	Internal guidance, memos, or policy documents related to how agencies should respond when a patient demonstrates significant recovery outside of standard medical interventions.
	•	Correspondence with hospitals, insurers, or research institutions regarding patients whose recovery disrupted ongoing care plans, cost projections, or research participation.
	•	Reports, audits, or program reviews that identify cases where “over-recovery,” “unexpected recovery,” or “outlier improvement” influenced eligibility, service continuation, or medical record classification.
	•	Communications with federal agencies (NIH, CMS, HHS, etc.) regarding data collection, research, or oversight of patient populations whose improvement conflicted with predictive modeling or program expectations.

If portions of this request are exempt from release, please provide the non-exempt portions and a written justification for each withheld record as required under the MGDPA.

Keywords: unexpected recovery, outlier improvement, over-recovery, denial of care, medical eligibility loss, coverage withdrawal, alternative treatment outcomes, nonstandard protocol recovery, research disruption.

Request:

Under the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act (MGDPA), I am requesting access to any and all records, communications, contracts, or oversight reports from 1990 to present regarding the use of geofencing, address verification restrictions, or mail delivery interference as mechanisms to deny or delay access to housing, healthcare coverage, or insurance eligibility within the state of Minnesota.

This request specifically seeks documentation related to:
	•	Policies or pilot programs where housing or medical insurance eligibility was tied to verified physical address, and how failure to receive mail was factored into eligibility determinations.
	•	Any use of geofencing or location-based restrictions in the administration of health coverage, housing access, or social services.
	•	Communications with federal agencies, contractors, or private technology vendors regarding the use of geospatial data, address validation, or mail service integrity in program delivery.
	•	Reports, audits, or complaints concerning individuals who were unable to obtain healthcare coverage or housing services due to lack of stable mailing address or unexplained mail service disruptions.
	•	Oversight documents related to the intersection of housing instability, mail access, and insurance eligibility within Minnesota programs.

If portions of this request are exempt from release, please provide the non-exempt portions and a written justification for each withheld record as required under the MGDPA.

Keywords: geofencing, address verification, denied housing, insurance eligibility barriers, mail service compromise, housing-linked coverage, service access restriction, geospatial eligibility enforcement.
