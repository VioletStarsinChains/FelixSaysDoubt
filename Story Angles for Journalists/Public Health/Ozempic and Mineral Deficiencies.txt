🧭 Field Guide: GLP-1 Drugs + Mineral Deficiency

(Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, etc.)

⸻

⚡ Why minerals matter

GLP-1s don’t just curb appetite — they slow digestion, change blood sugar handling, and remodel tissue.
If you’re low in minerals, side effects hit harder and stranger.

⸻

🪨 Key minerals at risk
	•	Magnesium (Mg): low → constipation, chest tightness, arrhythmias
	•	Potassium (K): low → cramps, palpitations, weakness
	•	Zinc (Zn): low → poor healing, taste changes, nausea
	•	Copper (Cu): low → anemia-like fatigue, neuropathy
	•	Selenium (Se): low → thyroid slowdown, hair loss, mood shifts

⸻

🚨 What you might notice
	•	Exaggerated nausea, bloating, constipation
	•	Extreme fatigue beyond appetite changes
	•	Headaches, dizziness, sensory flares
	•	Racing/irregular heartbeat, chest pressure
	•	Stiff joints, gum/dental changes, mineralized feeling tissues

⸻

🩸 Why blood tests can’t catch it
	•	Mostly intracellular: e.g. only 1% of magnesium is in serum
	•	Body masks deficiency: pulls from tissues to keep blood “normal”
	•	Ranges are crude: “normal” = not in crisis, not optimal

👉 Translation: even a careful doctor cannot guarantee GLP-1 safety with routine labs.

⸻

📝 What to do
	•	Track symptoms daily (bowel, energy, cramps, palpitations)
	•	Support basics: magnesium glycinate, trace minerals, electrolytes (avoid high calcium)
	•	Look for patterns around stress, dose changes, or skipped nutrients
	•	If possible, consider functional tests: RBC magnesium, hair/urine mineral analysis, OAT panels

⸻

✅ Bottom line: GLP-1 drugs magnify hidden mineral gaps. Standard bloodwork misses them.
Your real-time body signals are often the best early warning.
