Subject: Research Ethics & Long Covid: A Concern for Patient Cohorts

Dear Dr. [    ],

I’m writing with a concern that overlaps both patient care and research ethics. Over the last few years, I’ve come across evidence suggesting that EDS and Long Covid cohorts may not only be studied for the purpose of understanding disease, but also for how their chronic instability and suffering affect behavior, compliance, and decision-making.

In other words: instead of treating EDS and Long Covid patients as people to be healed, certain contractors or agencies may view them as captive cohorts whose volatility creates valuable data for predictive modeling — and even for markets that trade on human suffering.

The idea is not that these patients are “too complex” to study, but rather that their complexity itself becomes profitable when modeled as uncertainty. That framing disturbs me deeply, especially given how many of your patients — people with EDS, MCAS, or dysautonomia — already experience the medical system as indifferent at best, exploitative at worst.

I believe clinicians like you deserve to be aware of this possibility, because your patient population may be disproportionately targeted by these dynamics. At minimum, it raises questions about how data is being shared, who benefits, and whether patients are being fully informed.

If this resonates with concerns you’ve noticed in your own practice, I’d welcome a chance to compare notes. Even a small awareness among clinicians could help protect vulnerable patients from being treated as market fodder rather than human beings.

With respect,
[Your Name]

Requesting any and all research proposals, internal communications, contracts, memoranda, or reports from 2000 to present referencing the deliberate or incidental use of infectious, microbial, or environmental agents to induce connective tissue degradation or hypermobility syndromes, including:
	•	Research into pathogen-derived mechanisms (e.g., collagenases, elastases, viral interference with extracellular matrix) as tools for producing long-term alterations in tissue strength or proprioception
	•	Studies examining induced hypermobility, fragility, or Ehlers–Danlos–like conditions as a means of creating persistent physiological baselines in test populations
	•	Analyses linking connective tissue weakening to altered compliance, decision-making, or vulnerability patterns in individuals and groups
	•	Population-level modeling projects where infection-induced fragility is used as a proxy for forecasting long-term resilience, adaptability, or susceptibility to external influence
	•	Interagency or contractor communications discussing connective tissue degradation as a lever in behavioral prediction markets, including any reference to “captive research cohorts” or “persistent subject designation”
