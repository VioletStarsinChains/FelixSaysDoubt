Tip: File a FOIA on federally funded projects at UT Austin that combined biogeography and cross-species cognition research with predictive modeling. The request looks for records where studies of bird migration, animal communication (like parrots or button-using cats), or other ecological proxies were tied to models of human migration, compliance, or resilience. 

On paper, it’s environmental science and animal behavior — but if those links exist, it suggests UT Austin was a testing ground for “synthetic ecology” and cross-species cognitive modeling, where animals became practice models for predicting human populations in behavioral futures markets.

Sample FOIA texts:

To: National Science Foundation / Environmental Protection Agency / Department of Defense

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, research proposals, or internal communications referencing the use of biogeography, avian distribution studies, or ecological indicator species as inputs for predictive modeling of human behavior or population stability, from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Reports linking migratory bird studies or ecological distribution patterns to models of human migration, compliance, or resilience
	•	Communications between environmental scientists and defense/intelligence agencies regarding “indicator species” as early-warning signals of social instability
	•	Contracts or grants awarded for research into cross-applications of ecological data for behavioral futures modeling
	•	Risk/benefit assessments of applying ecological simulation frameworks (“synthetic ecology”) to human populations

Keywords: biogeography, indicator species, avian distribution, ecological modeling, synthetic ecology, population stability, migration modeling, behavioral futures, compliance forecasting, environmental proxy data

To: National Science Foundation / Environmental Protection Agency / Department of Defense / National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, research proposals, or internal communications referencing the use of geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing, or ecological biogeography as applied to predictive modeling of human behavior or population stability, from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Reports on the use of ecological distribution data (e.g., avian migration, indicator species, habitat range shifts) as proxy variables for human migration or compliance modeling
	•	Communications between environmental researchers and defense/intelligence agencies regarding “synthetic ecology” or cross-application of remote sensing tools to population monitoring
	•	Contracts or grants describing the integration of GIS-based ecological datasets into behavioral futures or risk forecasting platforms
	•	Risk/benefit assessments of adapting ecological simulation frameworks to human populations in the context of national security or resilience planning

Keywords: GIS, remote sensing, biogeography, ecological modeling, synthetic ecology, indicator species, migration forecasting, compliance modeling, population stability, behavioral futures

To: National Science Foundation / Department of Defense / Environmental Protection Agency / National Institutes of Health

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, research proposals, or internal communications regarding federally funded projects at the University of Texas at Austin involving the use of biogeography, ecological distribution studies, or cross-species cognitive modeling as applied to predictive analytics of human behavior or population stability, from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Reports linking ecological distribution research (e.g., avian migration, habitat range shifts) to predictive models of human migration, compliance, or resilience
	•	Contracts or grants for research into cross-species cognitive modeling (e.g., parrot language studies, primate problem-solving, animal communication via buttons or AI interfaces) with explicit or implicit applications to human behavioral futures
	•	Communications between UT Austin researchers and federal agencies regarding “synthetic ecology,” “indicator species,” or “cognitive proxies” for human populations
	•	Risk/benefit assessments of applying cross-species behavioral models to human social systems in the context of resilience, compliance, or surveillance

Keywords: UT Austin, biogeography, cross-species cognition, animal communication, indicator species, synthetic ecology, behavioral futures, compliance modeling, ecological proxy data, migration forecasting
