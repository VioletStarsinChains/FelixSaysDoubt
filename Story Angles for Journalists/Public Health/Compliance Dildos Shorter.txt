Opening hook:
Start with the unexpected:

Core argument:
The pitch would explore how romance novels and teledildonics are not just products — they’re behavioral laboratories.
	•	Romance fiction establishes archetypes of desire, loyalty, submission, and rebellion that already dominate mass media 
	•	Connected sex toys, meanwhile, provide real-time physiological data on arousal, compliance, and reinforcement.
	•	When combined, they form a closed-loop
 
Video spine:
	1.	The Harmless Cover 
	2.	The Data
	3.	Behavioral Futures 
	4.	The Romance 
	5.	The Dark Edge

Tone & positioning:
	•	Fits with Folding Ideas’ oeuvre — tech critique meets cultural analysis (like Line Goes Up and This Is Financial Advice).
	•	Doesn’t need to prove a conspiracy, just shows how markets naturally extract and consolidate intimacy into behavioral futures.
	•	Uses a mix of absurd examples (Kindle Unlimited smut charts, app-controlled buttplugs at conventions) and serious theory (Shoshana Zuboff’s Surveillance Capitalism, Byung-Chul Han on desire, Mark Fisher on capitalist realism).

Title ideas:
	•	Romance Compliance: How Intimacy Became an Asset Class
	•	The Billionaire, the Buttplug, and Behavioral Futures
	•	Synthetic Intimacy: Romance in the Age of Surveillance Capitalism
