Pitch: Enova — The Payday Palantir

Most people know Enova International as a payday lender. Fewer realize it’s positioning itself as something much more troubling: a data surveillance company disguised as a lender.
	•	Behavioral Harvesting:
Enova doesn’t just hand out high-interest loans. It collects massive streams of real-time behavioral data from some of the most vulnerable Americans — people making desperate financial choices under stress. Repayment timing, rollover patterns, even browsing behaviors become part of a predictive profile.
	•	Algorithmic Underwriting as Social Experiment:
Enova markets itself to investors as a machine learning company first, lender second. Their models don’t just assess risk — they test impulse control, compliance under stress, and repeat-cycle predictability. In other words, they’re running live experiments on human desperation.
	•	Regulatory Arbitrage:
By partnering with rent-a-bank institutions, Enova sidesteps state interest caps. Regulators like the CFPB, OCC, and FDIC have had to wrestle with this — and their files could reveal internal concerns about algorithmic bias and behavioral exploitation.
	•	The Bigger Question:
If Palantir builds predictive models on police and military data, Enova does it on the poor. Both represent behavioral futures markets — but one operates in the open under the guise of “fintech innovation.”

This raises urgent questions:
	•	Are federal agencies quietly contracting with Enova (or its datasets) for behavioral modeling?
	•	What protections exist for consumers whose financial stress patterns are being weaponized as compliance metrics?
	•	Why does a company that calls itself a “lender” look so much like a surveillance firm?

Story hook: Enova is publicly traded (ENVA), headquartered in Chicago, and presents itself to Wall Street as a high-tech data company. Yet its revenue comes from loans that often reach triple-digit APRs. In plain language: Enova monetizes poverty while branding itself as AI innovation.
