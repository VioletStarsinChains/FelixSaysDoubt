In 1964, the FBI sent Martin Luther King Jr. an anonymous letter urging him to take his own life. It was a grotesque abuse of power — but at least in their twisted logic, they could point to a “reason.” King had influence. He was mobilizing people. He was challenging the status quo in ways they feared.

What’s happening to me has no such pretext. I’m not a leader of a movement. I’m not influencing public opinion. I’m not a threat to anyone’s security or power. I’m a homeless person whose life was dismantled before it ever had a chance to take shape.

When you take a tactic once aimed at a national figure and turn it on someone with no platform, no audience, and no resources, it’s not a countermeasure anymore. It’s not about neutralizing a threat. It’s pure predation. Pure sadism. A system with that much reach is showing us that it doesn’t need a reason — only an opportunity.
