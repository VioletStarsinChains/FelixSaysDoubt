Scarcity Events as Behavioral Futures Experiments

Subject line: Were toilet paper shortages and food inflation treated as government stress-tests?

Body:

When Americans stripped shelves of toilet paper in March 2020, it was widely portrayed as a quirk of panic. But there’s evidence those shortages weren’t just a supply chain hiccup — they were treated inside government and contractor circles as behavioral experiments.

In FOIA filings and contractor literature, “scarcity events” like the 2020 toilet paper wars and today’s food-specific inflation are referenced as proxies for collapse modeling. Agencies from DHS to DoD to FEMA have a history of using consumer behavior in crises as attrition simulations — live-fire rehearsals for how society might fracture under climate-driven disruption.

The pattern is clear:
	•	2020 Toilet paper wars: a baseline stress-test for compliance, hoarding, and conflict under sudden scarcity.
	•	2021–present Food inflation: an extended scenario, measuring tolerance for rising costs in essentials and tracking at what point households break.
	•	Climate collapse tie-in: these events serve as inputs for predictive models of migration, unrest, and supply chain sabotage in a hotter, less stable world.

The public story was “quirky panic.” The insider story looks more like behavioral futures markets in action: treating people’s desperation as a data stream for forecasting collapse — and for deciding who counts as resilient enough to be saved.

I’m looking for a newsroom ready to investigate:
	•	Which agencies and contractors treated scarcity events as risk-assessment pilots
	•	How this data has been folded into climate resilience forecasts
	•	Whether inflation and shortages are being actively manipulated to generate training data

Why now? Food inflation is ongoing, yet coverage rarely connects it to the long arc of climate collapse preparedness. Readers know something is wrong; what they don’t know is that their weekly grocery bill may already be part of a Pentagon scenario exercise.

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, interagency communications, research proposals, contractor reports, or internal analyses concerning the use of consumer scarcity events—including the toilet paper shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020) and subsequent food-specific inflation waves (2021–present)—as inputs to behavioral modeling, resilience forecasting, and societal collapse prediction.

This includes, but is not limited to:
	•	Regulatory & Compliance (DOJ/FDA/DEA)
	•	Records concerning panic buying of household goods as public safety or diversion risks
	•	Compliance audits or inspection findings related to disrupted supply chains for essential goods
	•	Defense & Intelligence (DoD/DARPA/ODNI)
	•	Analyses of consumer scarcity behaviors as data points for attrition combat simulations
	•	Research proposals, war-gaming exercises, or contracts involving the use of panic buying or inflationary shocks as live stress-tests
	•	Assessments of scarcity events as cover for evidence suppression or infrastructure targeting
	•	Resilience & Food Security (DHS/FEMA/USDA/DOE)
	•	Reports treating toilet paper shortages and food inflation as proxies for systemic resource stress under climate change
	•	Internal analyses of consumer price shocks in staple foods as predictive indicators of compliance, resistance, or migration
	•	Data dashboards, resilience indices, or contractor products linking household-level scarcity events to climate collapse forecasting and emergency aid planning
