Minnesota Children’s Museum in St. Paul isn’t just a play space. We’re asking if it doubled as a behavioral lab for kids, feeding data into predictive modeling and surveillance markets. Children’s museums are designed as controlled environments: scripted exhibits, predictable group dynamics, and built-in segmentation by age, race, and income (through school trips and memberships). That makes them perfect sites for modeling compliance, attention, and influence.

The FOIAs request records on whether museum play sessions were treated as behavioral telemetry events, if data was funneled to contractors like Palantir or DARPA, and whether children’s offline play patterns were cross-linked with their digital profiles via COPPA loopholes. We also ask if exhibits were ever re-engineered as covert test environments, if compliance and attention were systematically tracked, and if the resulting datasets were used for AI training, predictive policing, or behavioral futures markets.

The core question: Did parents take their kids to the museum thinking it was play—while agencies or contractors saw it as a live market of future behaviors to trade on? This isn’t about scaring families away from museums. It’s about transparency. If children’s play spaces are being covertly engineered as behavioral futures labs, the public deserves to know.
