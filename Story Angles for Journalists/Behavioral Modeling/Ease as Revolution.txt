Pitch: When People Wise Up, the Data Dies

Subject line: What happens when surveillance subjects wise up? The data collapses.

Body:

Predictive surveillance only works if people don’t know they’re being modeled. The moment subjects become aware that their behaviors are being harvested, the signal collapses.

This is sometimes called the observer effect, but in the context of behavioral futures markets it’s more like an extinction event.
	•	Before awareness: volatility is predictable and exploitable — every panic, binge, or outburst is another data point.
	•	After awareness: behavior flattens, emotions lock down, and subjects refuse to produce clean signal. They become unmodelable anomalies.

Government contractors and agencies have quietly studied this problem for decades. FOIA filings suggest that entire research tracks are dedicated to “non-responders” — people whose emotional expressions collapse once they realize they’re being used as data. In market terms, it’s the moment the asset disappears.

Why this matters now:
	•	Behavioral futures markets underpin policing, finance, and even climate-collapse resilience models.
	•	If enough people wise up, the datasets erode — and the markets themselves lose predictive power.
	•	Agencies may be trying to design synthetic environments or entrainment tech to bypass awareness and restore volatility.

Story hook: What if the future of surveillance doesn’t hinge on how much data they collect, but on how many people refuse to play along?
