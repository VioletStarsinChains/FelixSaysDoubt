Pitch: “The Romance Machine: How Teledildonics and Romance Novels Got Pulled into Behavioral Futures Markets”

Opening hook:
Start with the unexpected overlap: the romance publishing industry, the most profitable segment of fiction, and the sex toy industry’s pivot to internet-connected devices. Both look like harmless consumer indulgences. Both turn out to be key datasets in behavioral compliance modeling.

Core argument:
The pitch would explore how romance novels and teledildonics are not just products — they’re behavioral laboratories.
	•	Romance fiction establishes archetypes of desire, loyalty, submission, and rebellion that already dominate mass media (think: billionaire romances, dark academia, enemies-to-lovers).
	•	Connected sex toys, meanwhile, provide real-time physiological data on arousal, compliance, and reinforcement.
	•	When combined, they form a closed-loop system: narrative input (romance tropes) → embodied feedback (teledildonic telemetry) → predictive modeling (behavioral futures markets).

Video spine:
	1.	The Harmless Cover Story: Romance novels are dismissed as “mom porn,” and teledildonics as fringe tech. Both are ridiculed enough to fly under the radar.
	2.	The Data Value: Amazon dominates romance publishing and controls Kindle Unlimited, while also acquiring or crushing sex toy competitors (Etsy sellers, niche fantasy toys). That means centralized control over romance narrative consumption AND physical intimacy telemetry.
	3.	Behavioral Futures Connection: Investors don’t just want to sell books or toys — they want compliance modeling pipelines. If you know how millions of people respond to tropes and stimuli, you can predict and steer behavior at scale.
	4.	The Romance as Governance: At the core is the notion of synthetic intimacy as a form of soft governance. Romantic archetypes become compliance anchors. The teledildonic hardware makes those archetypes “real” in the body.
	5.	The Dark Edge: Explore how this loops into election manipulation, product loyalty, and even parasocial cult formation, where the fantasy of being loved, dominated, or rescued can be activated at will.

Tone & positioning:
	•	Fits with Folding Ideas’ oeuvre — tech critique meets cultural analysis (like Line Goes Up and This Is Financial Advice).
	•	Doesn’t need to prove a conspiracy, just shows how markets naturally extract and consolidate intimacy into behavioral futures.
	•	Uses a mix of absurd examples (Kindle Unlimited smut charts, app-controlled buttplugs at conventions) and serious theory (Shoshana Zuboff’s Surveillance Capitalism, Byung-Chul Han on desire, Mark Fisher on capitalist realism).

Title ideas:
	•	Romance Compliance: How Intimacy Became an Asset Class
	•	The Billionaire, the Buttplug, and Behavioral Futures
	•	Synthetic Intimacy: Romance in the Age of Surveillance Capitalism
