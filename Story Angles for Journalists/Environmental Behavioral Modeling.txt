Tip: a FOIA with the EPA covering Deputy Director Stan Meiburg’s 40-year tenure, asking whether environmental monitoring data — pollution, water quality, soil chemistry — was ever shared with defense or intelligence agencies as input for behavioral prediction models. The request looks for records on “synthetic ecology,” where environmental datasets were used not just to track ecosystems but to anticipate human stability and compliance. If those links exist, it would mean that for decades the EPA wasn’t only regulating pollution — it may have been feeding into the same behavioral futures systems now guiding AI and surveillance.

To: Environmental Protection Agency / Office of Research and Development

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, research proposals, or internal communications generated during the tenure of 1977-2017 regarding the use of environmental datasets for predictive modeling of human behavior.

This includes:
	•	Reports or proposals linking air, water, or soil quality metrics to behavioral or cognitive outcomes in nearby populations
	•	Communications with defense or intelligence agencies regarding “synthetic ecology” or environmental simulations used to anticipate social stability
	•	Vendor contracts describing integration of EPA data streams into broader compliance or public health prediction frameworks
	•	Risk/benefit assessments of sharing environmental monitoring data with agencies outside EPA for purposes beyond environmental regulation

Keywords: synthetic ecology, predictive modeling, environmental dataset, compliance, behavioral futures, EPA-DOD cooperation, soil chemistry, water contaminants, cognitive outcomes, Stan Meiburg

To: National Science Foundation / Environmental Protection Agency / Department of Defense

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, research proposals, or internal communications referencing the use of biogeography, avian distribution studies, or ecological indicator species as inputs for predictive modeling of human behavior or population stability, from 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Reports linking migratory bird studies or ecological distribution patterns to models of human migration, compliance, or resilience
	•	Communications between environmental scientists and defense/intelligence agencies regarding “indicator species” as early-warning signals of social instability
	•	Contracts or grants awarded for research into cross-applications of ecological data for behavioral futures modeling
	•	Risk/benefit assessments of applying ecological simulation frameworks (“synthetic ecology”) to human populations

Keywords: biogeography, indicator species, avian distribution, ecological modeling, synthetic ecology, population stability, migration modeling, behavioral futures, compliance forecasting, environmental proxy data

This includes:
	•	Reports on the use of ecological distribution data (e.g., avian migration, indicator species, habitat range shifts) as proxy variables for human migration or compliance modeling
	•	Communications between environmental researchers and defense/intelligence agencies regarding “synthetic ecology” or cross-application of remote sensing tools to population monitoring
	•	Contracts or grants describing the integration of GIS-based ecological datasets into behavioral futures or risk forecasting platforms
	•	Risk/benefit assessments of adapting ecological simulation frameworks to human populations in the context of national security or resilience planning
