Tip: a FOIA with the EPA covering Deputy Director Stan Meiburg’s 40-year tenure, asking whether environmental monitoring data — pollution, water quality, soil chemistry — was ever shared with defense or intelligence agencies as input for behavioral prediction models. The request looks for records on “synthetic ecology,” where environmental datasets were used not just to track ecosystems but to anticipate human stability and compliance. If those links exist, it would mean that for decades the EPA wasn’t only regulating pollution — it may have been feeding into the same behavioral futures systems now guiding AI and surveillance.

Sample FOIA text:

To: Environmental Protection Agency / Office of Research and Development

Request:

Requesting any and all documents, contracts, research proposals, or internal communications generated during the tenure of 1977-2017 regarding the use of environmental datasets for predictive modeling of human behavior, from 1990 to 2005.

This includes:
	•	Reports or proposals linking air, water, or soil quality metrics to behavioral or cognitive outcomes in nearby populations
	•	Communications with defense or intelligence agencies regarding “synthetic ecology” or environmental simulations used to anticipate social stability
	•	Vendor contracts describing integration of EPA data streams into broader compliance or public health prediction frameworks
	•	Risk/benefit assessments of sharing environmental monitoring data with agencies outside EPA for purposes beyond environmental regulation

Keywords: synthetic ecology, predictive modeling, environmental dataset, compliance, behavioral futures, EPA-DOD cooperation, soil chemistry, water contaminants, cognitive outcomes, Stan Meiburg
