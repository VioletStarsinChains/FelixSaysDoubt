In the Star Trek: Voyager episode “Jetrel,” a weapon called the metreon cascade vaporizes an entire colony, leaving nothing but microscopic residue in the air. Decades later, the scientist who built it claims he can reconstitute the dead from those particles — raising agonizing questions about loss, recovery, and exploitation.

It sounds like pure science fiction. But what if our real-world handling of Missing in Action service members isn’t so different? The Pentagon’s official line is that they remain “unrecovered” — yet industrial processes routinely absorb cremains and bone ash into materials as fillers, fluxes, and pigments. Steel, textiles, coatings, even consumer goods sometimes rely on “recycled organics” euphemisms. What if the MIAs we’re told can’t be brought home are in fact already here — hidden in the very materials of daily life?

For veterans and families, the promise of recovery is sacred. But the continuity between Voyager’s cascade and real-world attrition raises a chilling question: is “Missing in Action” actually shorthand for missing into the system?
