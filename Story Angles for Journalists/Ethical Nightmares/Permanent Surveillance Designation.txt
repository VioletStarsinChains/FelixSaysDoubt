The Forever File — How Permanent Surveillance Designations Lock People into Neurotech Systems

Most of us think of surveillance as something you can escape: log off, leave your phone at home, delete an app. But buried inside government research proposals and contracts is a darker concept: “permanent surveillance designation.” Once tagged, a person is never released. Their movements, thoughts, and even physiological signals can be tracked indefinitely, with no off-ramp.

Emerging evidence suggests this isn’t just about metadata or phone records — it’s about neurotechnology tethering. In other words, binding a subject to the surveillance grid by linking their brain signals, biometric telemetry, or behavioral signatures in a way that can’t be undone. Once tethered, the person becomes a “lifetime subject” whose data is continuously harvested and even commodified in behavioral futures markets.

The ethical questions are staggering: what does it mean to brand someone with a designation they can never shed? How many people have been locked into such systems without consent? And who profits from the futures market built on their behavior?

This isn’t science fiction — the paper trail runs through DARPA, DHS, and contracts with private data brokers. A FOIA request has been filed to surface the documents. The question now is whether journalists are ready to shine a light on a system that doesn’t just watch people — it ensnares them permanently.

Sample FOIA texts:

To: Department of Homeland Security / Federal Bureau of Investigation / Department of Defense / Office of the Director of National Intelligence

Request:

Requesting any and all internal communications, policy documents, contracts, research proposals, or oversight reports from 2000 to present that reference or relate to the concept of “permanent surveillance designation” in human subjects, populations, or operational environments.

This includes but is not limited to:
	•	Records describing criteria or thresholds for placing individuals or populations under indefinite monitoring, including cross-referenced behavioral, medical, or technological markers.
	•	Documents outlining the legal or procedural mechanisms for sustaining indefinite surveillance status beyond initial justification periods.
	•	Research proposals or contracts addressing predictive modeling, risk assessment, or anomaly tracking where the designation of “permanent surveillance” is a categorical outcome.
	•	Interagency communications regarding “sunset” or termination criteria for surveillance designations, or lack thereof.
	•	Policy or oversight reports evaluating the ethical, legal, or operational implications of “permanent” or “indefinite” subject tethering to surveillance systems.

Keywords: permanent surveillance designation, indefinite monitoring protocol, subject tethering, anomaly tracking, behavioral futures monitoring, risk designation permanence, surveillance retention policy

To: Department of Homeland Security / Department of Defense / Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency / Federal Bureau of Investigation / Office of the Director of National Intelligence

Request:

Requesting any and all internal communications, contracts, research proposals, or oversight documents from 2000 to present that reference or relate to “permanent surveillance designation” of human subjects, with particular attention to systems involving neurotechnology tethering, behavioral futures markets, and predictive modeling infrastructure.

This includes but is not limited to:
	•	Records describing experimental frameworks in which surveillance designation is made irreversible or bound to a subject through neurotechnological integration or biometric coupling.
	•	Communications regarding the use of “lifetime tethering” or equivalent terminology in programs involving neural interfaces, cognitive telemetry, or behavioral telemetry systems.
	•	Research proposals describing the monetization of surveillance designations via behavioral futures trading, credit scoring, or algorithmic profiling.
	•	Interagency agreements or contracts with private sector firms, including social media platforms or data brokers, for the exploitation of permanent surveillance cohorts.
	•	Oversight reports or ethical analyses addressing the risks of indefinite or inescapable surveillance designations, particularly when tied to experimental populations or vulnerable cohorts.
