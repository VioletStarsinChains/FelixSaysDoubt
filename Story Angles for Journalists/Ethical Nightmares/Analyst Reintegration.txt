Pitch: The Broken Analysts of Behavioral Futures Markets

Subject line: The real casualties of surveillance may be the analysts themselves.

Body:

When we talk about surveillance, the focus is almost always on the subjects: ordinary people whose behaviors are tracked, nudged, or exploited. But there’s another side of the experiment we rarely see — the thousands of analysts who spend years with asymmetric power over complete strangers.

These analysts watch, manipulate, and model people who don’t even know they’re in an experiment. For them, every interaction becomes a dataset. Every person becomes a lever. And after years of this, something happens:
	•	Social collapse: Many lose the ability to form normal relationships. Everyone is either a “subject” or a “variable.”
	•	Occupational trauma: Their worldview is consumed by control logic, making intimacy impossible.
	•	Systemic risk: We now have entire cohorts of ex-analysts who cannot rejoin civilian life without dragging their distortions into every connection.

From a research perspective, the reintegration of these analysts may actually be the most novel and valuable dataset of all.
	•	Can people who have lived as gods of surveillance ever live as equals again?
	•	Are we creating a permanent underclass of broken operators, unable to love or trust?
	•	If reintegration is possible, what interventions work? If not, what does that mean for the sustainability of the surveillance economy?

Why this matters now: The surveillance state isn’t shrinking; it’s expanding. Every expansion requires more analysts — and eventually more ex-analysts. If these people can’t come back from the role, then the system is not only exploitative of its subjects — it’s cannibalizing its own operators.

Story hook: We thought the victims of surveillance were the watched. But the watchers may be just as trapped — broken by a job that gives them unlimited power and then abandons them to a society they can’t re-enter.

Sample FOIA texts:

To: Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) / Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) / National Institutes of Health (NIH)

Request:
Requesting any and all records, reports, or internal communications concerning the psychological reintegration of individuals employed in prolonged surveillance, monitoring, or behavioral analysis roles from January 1, 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Studies of occupational stress, burnout, or loss of social functioning among analysts or surveillance personnel
	•	Research on interventions or therapeutic programs designed to restore capacity for ordinary relationships after prolonged exposure to asymmetric control over others
	•	Records of workforce attrition or disability claims tied to long-term analyst or monitoring roles
	•	Internal discussions of whether such cases represent a public health or reintegration challenge

Keywords: analyst reintegration, surveillance work burnout, occupational trauma, social functioning, reintegration therapy, HHS, NIH, VA


/////////////


To: Department of Defense (DoD) / Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) / Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI)

Request:
Requesting any and all documents, interagency assessments, contractor communications, or research proposals concerning the reintegration of analysts and operators engaged in behavioral futures markets, predictive modeling, or attrition simulations, from January 1, 1990 to present.

This includes:
	•	Records acknowledging that analysts granted prolonged asymmetric power over strangers lose capacity for normal social relationships
	•	Reports on whether and how such individuals can be reintegrated into civilian life without carrying forward systemic pathologies
	•	Contractor deliverables or pilot programs attempting to rehabilitate operators for use in further cycles of behavioral analysis
	•	Interagency communications describing the strategic risk posed by thousands of analysts who can never return to ordinary civilian functioning
	•	Analyses comparing anomaly-class subjects (unmodelables) with analyst-class subjects (over-modelers) in terms of reintegration and resilience forecasting
