I’m looking at a strange overlap between labor arbitration, behavioral modeling, and indie music. Justin Vernon (Bon Iver) has built a career around authenticity — but his father has quietly been one of the most embedded labor arbitrators in America, sitting on panels for every critical sector from airlines to steel to nuclear energy, alongside organizations like the FAA, Major League Baseball, and the Department of Labor. His caseload reads less like “labor disputes” and more like a map of continuity-critical infrastructure.

This raises some provocative questions: Was arbitration data ever repurposed for predictive analytics — essentially, “human response derivatives”? And if so, what does it mean when the son of a continuity-theater operator becomes one of America’s most mythologized “authentic” artists? Is Bon Iver less a grassroots phenomenon and more an astroturfed export — the culture-layer equivalent of his father’s continuity maintenance?

I’ve drafted FOIA requests that go after arbitration data pipelines and contractor involvement (RAND, Booz Allen, Palantir, etc.), but I think the more intriguing story for readers is the juxtaposition: indie authenticity on stage, systemic continuity management in the family background.

Sample FOIA text:

To Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) / American Arbitration Association (AAA) / National Mediation Board (NMB) / Department of Labor (DOL)

Request:

Requesting any and all records, contracts, research proposals, contractor deliverables, or interagency communications from 1975 to present concerning the use of arbitration or mediation case data for predictive modeling, behavioral analysis, or labor forecasting.

This includes:
	•	Internal studies or commissioned reports analyzing arbitration case outcomes, bargaining patterns, or worker resistance strategies as input for predictive analytics.
	•	Communications between FMCS, AAA, NMB, or DOL and private contractors (including RAND, MITRE, McKinsey, or similar firms) regarding the use of arbitration data for behavioral modeling or futures-style forecasting.
	•	Records discussing whether arbitration or grievance data were shared with other federal agencies (such as the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, or intelligence community) for the purpose of continuity-of-operations planning, workforce resilience modeling, or attrition simulations.
	•	Any ethics reviews, risk assessments, or oversight memos addressing the appropriateness of repurposing arbitration records for behavioral futures markets or predictive labor analytics.
	•	Documentation of pilot programs, workshops, or training modules that referenced arbitration data in connection with market modeling, labor market volatility instruments, or workforce compliance studies.

Keywords: arbitration data, mediation records, grievance analytics, predictive modeling, behavioral forecasting, futures markets, attrition simulation, continuity-of-operations, FMCS, AAA, NMB, Department of Labor
